"1","01-04-21"," … of Ebeneezer Baptist Church. Change still has a chance in the church that changed America. He’s senior pastor of one of the most prominent churches in America. Raphael Warnock not only preaches the gospel, but uses it as a platform for change. Dr. Y’all can get louder than that. I said make some noise, one time. All right, there’s a reason why we’re all here, and let’s get to that reason. I’m going to bring the Reverend to the stage. I’m going to bring the Reverend to the stage. Make some noise for Raphael Warnock, one time. Well, hello Atlanta, Georgia. Sounds like you’re all ready to win an election. Georgia, we’re almost there. But we’ve got to finish the job. Let me hear you, if you’ve already voted. So, thank you so very much for voting, for exercising your right, and your civic obligation, but know that if you’ve already voted, your job is not done. Your job is not done until you call everybody in your circle, everybody you know, until you call your family members and your friends and you tell them to vote. Tell them that the preacher said a vote is a kind of prayer for the kind of world we want to live in, and our prayers are stronger when we pray together, so vote together. We’re so honored to have back in Atlanta, the President Elect of the United States of America, Joe Biden, and I’m so grateful to be standing on this stage at this defining moment in American history. I grew up in public housing, one of 12 children in my family, I’m number 11, and I’m the first college graduate in my family. I got there through hard work, grit, and determination, but that alone does not put me on this stage at this defining moment. My parents poured into me the ethic of hard work. They taught me what personal responsibility looks like. My mother grew up in Waycross, Georgia. You know where that is, way across Georgia. So, she believed in hard work. She grew up in the summers in the 1950s, a black teenager picking somebody else’s cotton, picking somebody else’s tobacco, but because this is the United States of America, the other day the 82 year old hands that used to pick somebody else’s cotton, went to the polls and picked her youngest son to be a United States senator from the great state of Georgia. Only in America is my story even possible, and I’m running for the United States Senate because I believe in the American promise. I believe in the American dream, but it is slipping away from too many of our children. Not just poor children growing up in the housing projects of Atlanta or Savannah, but in rural communities, disaffected communities across North Georgia. Our children need to know that they have a senator in the United States senate who understands their struggles, understands the struggles of ordinary people, and who will fight for them. The wealthy and the well connected have no shortage of representation in Washington. It’s time for ordinary people, folk who go to work every day, folk who would love to go to work but they have lost their jobs due to no fault of their own, it’s time for ordinary folk to have representation in Washington, and if you send me to the senate, every single day I’ll have Georgia on my mind. I won’t be thinking about how I can best represent the insurance companies, and how I can best represent the pharmaceutical companies. They have enough representatives. It’s time for ordinary folks to have somebody thinking about them. So, listen, we’ve got work to do. The stakes of this election can hardly be overstated. We’ve had about 350,000 American souls to perish. That’s a lot of empty seats at Thanksgiving, that’s a lot of empty chairs at Christmas, the lighting of the Hanukkah candles. That’s a lot of empty spaces as we welcomed the New Year and folks thought about their loved ones who are no longer with them, and even in the midst of this unspeakable human pain and suffering, what did we witness? We saw the politicians playing games. Politicians who are so focused on the next election that they’re not thinking about the next generation. They’re thinking about what’s in their best interest. You heard the debate this week. Too often it was really about the politicians. Who’s in and who’s out? Who’s winning and who’s losing? Meanwhile, as I walk across the streets of Atlanta and the streets of Georgia, the people are losing every single day, and they need a voice in their democracy. They need senators who understand that we’ve got to get this virus under control, that we’ve got to get this vaccine safely and efficiently distributed. That we’ve got to stand up and we’ve got to provide COVID relief to workers. We’ve got to help them to be able to get back to work safely, and we’ve got to make sure that we center the concerns of small business owners. We’ve got work to do, and in the midst of the work that we must do, we can hardly afford to be divided. So, here’s what you’ve got to do. You’ve got to tell your family members and tell your friends to vote tomorrow, and when they show up to vote, here is the work that they are doing, here is the important moral work that they are doing, they are pushing hard against the forces of division and distraction in our politics, because there are folk who are trying so hard to divide us. I’m running against the unelected senator of Georgia. She was appointed, the people of Georgia have been disappointed. She gives a lot of money to the Republican Party, and somehow she got a seat. And when she went to that seat she did not waste much time helping you to understand why she wanted it in the first place. She had barely unpacked, had been there three weeks, when she heard about the coronavirus pandemic. Rather than focusing on the folk who were sheltering in, she was focused on sheltering her own investments, profiting off of a pandemic while the people of Georgia were suffering and losing their jobs, and when it came time to give ordinary people some relief, she said, “I see no need.” She said it was counterproductive. Meanwhile, she was profiting off of a pandemic. Who does that? Who does that? Forgive me, I’m from the hood. Where I’m from we would say, “Why they do dat at?” Profiting off of a pandemic. So, have you noticed, she hasn’t even bothered to make a case, Georgia, for why you should keep her in that seat, and that’s because she has no case to make. Instead, she’s trying to distract you, trying to misrepresent my record. Have you noticed? Lying on me, lying on my church, the spiritual home of Martin Luther King Jr. Lying on the gospel. As we say in church, calling me everything but a child of God, scandalizing my name. But that’s all right, my mother down in Savannah, Georgia, she said, “It’s not what they call you, it’s what you answer by.” And in a few days she can call me Senator Raphael Warnock. And as we build this movement, as we make sure everybody is engaged and everybody is involved, we will continue this blue wave that will make its way all across this state, the ripples of which will be felt all across this nation. Georgia, are you ready to win this election? So, don’t sleep through this movement. Don’t sleep through this moment. There is too much at stake. My father used to wake me up every morning, rain or shine, seven days a week. Weekdays, Saturdays, Sundays. During the school year, during the summer. You couldn’t sleep in my father’s house. He was a veteran during the World War II era, and he never lost that sense that you ought to get up, get dressed, put your shoes on, get ready. And I’d say, “Dad, what do you mean get ready? It’s Saturday. Get ready for what?” He said, “I don’t know, just put your shoes on, boy.” I tell you, what you need to do later, just make sure you’re ready. That annoyed me when I was a little boy, when I was a teenager. But I’m so glad that my daddy woke me up every morning, God bless his soul, because in this defining moment, I want you to know, Georgia, I’m ready. I’m ready to be your next United States Senator. I’m ready to work alongside my brother Jon Ossoff, as you send us to the United States Senate. Think about this; in this defining moment when folks are trying to define us, Georgia is getting ready to send to the United States Senate, a young Jewish man, the son of an immigrant and a black preacher. The pastor of Ebeneezer Baptist Church where Martin Luther King Jr. used to serve and where John Lewis worshiped. I don’t know about you, but I’m so proud of the state of Georgia. Let America hear you roar. Can I ask you one more time, are you ready to win this election? Well, call everybody you know and tell them to get up, get dressed, put your shoes on, get ready for affordable healthcare. Get ready for a livable wage. Get ready to reclaim our democracy and reclaim the future for all of our children. God bless you. Let’s win the future. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Let’s keep this energy going. Are you all ready to win tomorrow? What’s up? I said are we ready to win tomorrow? What’s up? All right, we’re going to keep it going. Without further ado, I bring to you, Jon Ossoff to the stage. Hello Atlanta. Forever I love Atlanta. You all give it up again for my brother, the reverend Raphael Warnock. Atlanta, Georgia, it all comes down to this. Tomorrow is election day. The eyes of the nation are on Georgia right now, the eyes of the world are on Georgia right now. Feel your power, Georgia. Tomorrow we make history. Now, I want you to say it with me now. Say, “Vote. Say, “Vote. Say, “Vote. Tomorrow we make history, and think about how far we’ve come, Atlanta. Think about how far we’ve come in the great state of Georgia. Think about how far we’ve come in the American South. Georgia is the most competitive battleground state in the United States. You did that. You did that. And now hosting two runoff elections for the United States Senate to determine control of the United States Senate, your standard bearers are the young Jewish son of an immigrant and a black pastor who holds Dr. King’s pulpit at Ebeneezer Baptist Church. Think about far we’ve come, Atlanta. Think about how far we’ve come. And we’re running against … We’re running against the Bonnie and Clyde of corruption in American politics. Two United States senators who, when they learned about this pandemic that was bearing down on our shores, when they learned about the threat posed by a virus that’s now killed more than 300,000 of our fellow Americans, their first call was to their stockbroker. Atlanta, we deserve better, and retirement is coming for David Purdue and Kelly Loeffler, Atlanta. But see, we have bigger and better things to discuss than David and Kelly, like where we go from here as a people. Where we go from here as a community, as a state, as a nation. We’ve had four years of hatred, and racism, and bigotry, and lies, and incompetence, but Donald Trump is leaving, and Georgia voters sent Donald Trump packing. You did that. So now it’s time to rebuild. Now it’s time to build an America that’s defined by love, that’s defined by unity, that’s defined by compassion and empathy. Those are the substance of community, those must be our guiding lights, because we love each other. I’m going to take a page out of the reverend’s playbook. Turn to your neighbor and tell them you love them. This is about love. I love you too. And we are building a movement based on love, for health, jobs and justice for the people. Health, jobs and justice for all the people, Atlanta. Let’s talk about health for a moment. 300,000 Americans killed by this virus, our hospital systems, our nursing homes buckling under the weight of this pandemic. So many who have lost so much. Loved ones buried, loved ones who have lost their lives unable to see or touch their loved ones as they pass. A government that has lied to us every step of the way. We can beat COVID-19, Atlanta. We can pass legislation to rush resources to hospitals and nursing homes. We can make sure every American gets access to testing and vaccines free of charge. We can beat COVID-19 and get our daily lives back. Healthcare is a human right, and not just a privilege for those who have enough money in their bank accounts or who live in the right zip code. I was just down in Cuthbert, Georgia a few days ago, Randolph County in South Georgia. Y’all, they lost their hospital in October. Here, in the United States of America, the wealthiest country in the world, in the middle of a pandemic, their hospital closed. And now the people of Randolph County, if they need an emergency room, they’ve got to drive an hour and a half to go to Columbus or Albany. And it’s one of nine hospitals we’ve lost in Georgia in the last 10 years. You send me and Reverend Warnock to the senate, we will deliver the resources to reopen those nine hospitals, and to build new clinics in every corner of this state, because healthcare is a human right. We will stand up to the drug companies who are ripping off Georgia families at the pharmacy every single day, charging outrageous prices for lifesaving medicine and insulin. We will ensure that every single American has great health insurance, no matter their ability to pay, whether they have a preexisting condition, suffering from asthma, or diabetes, or a cancer survivor, because Georgia, healthcare is a human right, and we will make it so in the United States of America. And let me give a special shout out to all the mothers out there. Let me give a special shout out to my mama, who is here. Where is Heather? I love you, mom. Y’all may not know this, but my wife, Alicia, works as an OBGYN doctor at Grady hospital, in labor and delivery right here in Atlanta, and she sees every day at work, mothers who struggle, who suffer, babies who struggle into this world because our leaders have refused to expand Medicaid, because our leaders have refused to invest in maternal health. We have one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the entire country here in Georgia, and if you send me and Reverend Warnock to the US Senate, when you send me and Reverend Warnock to the US Senate, we will surge resources to save lives, to make sure every county in this state has an OBGYN doctor, because healthcare is a human right, Atlanta. Health, jobs and justice for all the people. Let’s talk about jobs. Millions have lost their jobs during this crisis. Millions facing eviction and foreclosure, small businesses across our state operating at 20% or 30% capacity. Gas bill piling up, credit card maxed out, families that can’t afford childcare, and for eight months straight the United States Senate blocked the direct relief that the people needed. Let him never deceive you, David Purdue opposed direct stimulus for the people all year long. Last week David Purdue changed his tune. Well, guess what? There’s an election coming. Georgia, you deserve senators who have your back, not just when they’re about to face the people, but at all times. And when you send me and Reverend Warnock to the senate, we will pass those $2000 stimulus checks that the people need, that families need to stay on their feet and in their homes. We will pass the most ambitious jobs, infrastructure, and recovery program in US history. We will upgrade public schools, we will build those clinics and hospitals, we will upgrade transit and transportation to connect every county here in metro Atlanta, to connect every city, every corner of the state, and to connect Georgia with the rest of the southeast. We will create tens of thousands of jobs in clean and renewable energy, saving our planet while we make America the number one producer of clean energy in the world, and Georgia the number one producer of clean energy in the south. Y’all, I want you to feel what we can achieve together. I want you to feel what is possible. I want you to believe in what is possible. And look, here’s the bottom line; if Mitch McConnell and the republicans hold onto the senate, they will try to do to Joe and Kamala exactly what they tried to do to President Obama, but we have too much good work to do for things to be ground to a halt in our nation’s capital. We need to raise the minimum wage to $15. We need to expand the Pell Grant program, so no young person in this state has to take on debt to get a degree from a public college or from an HBCU. We need to relieve the burden of student debt from those who are currently struggling to get out from under their loans. We can do all these things when we win tomorrow. We can deliver health, jobs and justice for the people, for all the people. Let’s talk about justice, Atlanta. Let’s talk about justice. I mentioned my mother a few minutes ago. Y’all may not know this, my mother came to this country as an immigrant when she was 23 years old, alone as a woman. Takes a lot of courage to uproot your life at that age, move to the other side of the planet and start new. But like so many immigrants, my mother came to this country because she believed that this country stood for certain ideals. Let me be clear that that doesn’t mean that she indulged any fantasies about our past. That doesn’t mean that she didn’t recognize how much further America had to go. She became a young activist. My mother was marching in the streets for the equal rights amendment in the 1970s. She had me walking around the house when I was three or four years old with one of those ERA Now buttons on. So, now you see where I’m coming from. My mother became an activist and my mother became a citizen, because she recognized that the ballot box is where we demand progress. The ballot box is where we hold elected officials accountable. The ballot box is where we make sure this country keeps moving on a journey of progress, toward fully realizing the very best of our founding ideals. Equality in God’s eyes, equal justice for all. Equal justice for all. Our constitution already guarantees equal protection under the law, but when Ahmaud Arbery is shot to death in broad daylight in the street on camera, and the local authorities look the other way because he is a young black man, that makes a mockery of equal protection under the law. Are you ready to fight to pass a new voting rights act that will secure the sacred franchise that John Lewis and so many bled and suffered for? Are you ready to fight for health, and jobs and justice for all the people? Are you ready to send a message that echoes, not just from coast to coast, but down the generations about what this state stands for? Atlanta, we just have a few hours left. I’m asking you to dream about what’s possible. I’m asking you to believe in what’s possible. I’m asking you to work to make real what is possible. No regrets. No regrets. No regrets. No regrets. Yes [inaudible 00:32:13]. We are on the cusp of a historic victory. That’s right. Feel it. Know it. Believe it. Work for it. Atlanta, say it with me again, say, “Vote. Vote. Say, “Vote. Vote. Say, “Vote. Vote. I love you all. Thank you so much. God bless you. As a reminder, today’s event has been set up to adhere to social distancing guidelines, as outlined by health experts in the state of Georgia. Thank you. Not yet. Not yet. No sir, not yet. [crosstalk 00:33:53] Yes. Please welcome, Allie Tong. Hello everybody. My name is Allie. And I’m a student at Campbell High School. And on November 3rd, like so many of you, I was a first time voter. I don’t have words to describe the feeling I had, holding that ballot in my hand. For the first time, I had a voice, a voice that would impact our country’s future. I didn’t expect to experience that feeling for another four years. But here we are. Today, we Georgians have the power to bring COVID-19 relief, to reform our criminal justice system, to move towards cleaner energy. However, none of this can be done if we don’t all vote. Whether this is your first election, or your 20th, your vote will dictate the future of our country. We are in a time when leadership is needed. We are in a time when our voices need to be loud. So please, Georgia, use your vote, your voice, to put Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock in the US Senate. It is now with great honor that I introduce President-Elect Joe Biden. Hello [inaudible 00:44:18]. Hello, hello, hello. Hello. Whoo. It’s good to be back. It’s good to be back. Let’s hear it for Allie, and that introduction, and a great line up of entertainers you’ve had. You’re probably disappointed, you’re not speaking. We’ll get the entertainers back out here. Nah. And let’s hear it for Stacey Abrams. Nobody, nobody in America has done more for the right to vote than Stacey. Stacey, you’re a change in Georgia. You’ve changed America. And I want to personally thank you again. So let’s hear it for the next Public Service Commissioner, Daniel Blackman. I don’t know where Daniel is, but I know he’s here. Look, and one of the best Mayors America has, and my good friend, Keisha Lance Bottoms. If I had three of her, I could rule the world. I love her, I tell you. And let’s hear it for the next United States Senators Jon Ossoff and the Reverend Warnock. I was just talking with them in the back. They’re talented. They’re principled. They’re qualified. They’re decent. They’re honorable. They mean what they say and they believe what I believe the definition of America is. It’s about possibilities, unlike any other nation in the world, anything’s possible. They’re bending the arc of history towards justice and hope and progress. And that’s not hyperbole, that’s real. Folks, this is it. This is it. It’s a New Year. And tomorrow can be a new day for Atlanta, for Georgia, and for America. First, let me start by saying thank you for electing me and Kamala as President and Vice President of the United States. You voted in record numbers in November. Your voices were heard. Your votes were counted. And the rule of the people prevailed. We won, three times here. Each recount, you know what I mean? I think we should count it as three states. We won three times. And now, we need for you to vote again in record numbers, to make your voices heard again and again, to change Georgia, to change America again. And this is not an exaggeration. Georgia, the whole nation is looking to you to lead us forward, for real. You know it. You cannot turn on any national television show without knowing about what’s going on here and what you all are doing. The power, the power is literally in your hands. Unlike any time in my career, one state can chart the course, not just for the next four years, but for the next generation. [crosstalk 00:47:26] By electing Jon and the Reverend, you can make an immediate difference in your own lives, the lives of the people all across this country. Because their election will put an end to the block in Washington, that $2000 stimulus check, that money would go out the door immediately, to help people who are in real trouble. Lives, putting food on the table, paying rent, paying part of your mortgage, paying down the credit card, paying the phone bill, the gas bill, the electric bill. Just look around. Millions of people in this country out of work through no fault of their own. No fault of their own. They’re struggling. Many are fearful and many have given up hope. Look at the lines at food banks, hours and hours and hours. This is the United States of America, for God’s sake and there are food lines like we’ve not seen since the depression and they’re getting longer. Families, children, people who have worked their whole lives and never asked for a thing except a fighting chance, now, they’re lining up for food in America and the debate over $2,000 isn’t some abstract debate in Washington, it’s about real lives. Your lives, the lives of good, hardworking Americans and if you’re like millions of Americans all across this country, you need the money, you need the help and you need it now. Look, Georgia there’s no one in America with more power to make that happen than you, the citizens of Atlanta, the citizens of Georgia and that’s not an exaggeration. That’s literally true. If you send Jon and the reverend to Washington, those $2,000 checks will go out the door restoring hope and decency and honor for so many people who are struggling right now, and if you send Senators Perdue and Loeffler back to Washington, those checks will never get there. It’s just that simple. The power is literally in your hands by electing Jon and the reverend you can break the gridlock that has gripped Washington and this nation. With their votes in the senate, we’ll be able to make the progress we need to make on jobs, on healthcare, on justice, on the environment and so many important things. By electing Jon and the reverend, you’ll be voting to get the states the resources they need to get the vaccines distributed. It’s a shame what’s happening now. It’s a literal shame. I’ve said it before, getting America vaccinated will be one of the most difficult operational challenges this nation’s ever faced but we’ve known it for the last months. This administration has gotten off to a God-awful start. The president spends more time whining and complaining than doing something about the problem. I don’t know why he still wants the job, he doesn’t want to do the work. Look, the states need help. There’s a reason why the constitution said the federal government could have a deficit spending in times of crisis and states have to balance their budgets. It’s for this very thing. It’s the whole idea, your states have to balance your budgets. So what’s happening? You’re going to see more and more people laid off, more firefighters, police officers, school teachers, first responders, the people we need badly now. The states need more money to do the job. They need to the federal government to work with them, not attack them and leave them out there hanging. It’s going to be tough to get this done, but we have to do it. People’s lives literally depend on it. Our economy depends on it and we’ll get it done by electing Jon and the reverend to be voting to get their states and local government funding the money they need to keep cops, firefighters, teachers, local responders, keep them on the job protecting you, looking out for your children. Look, states have been struggling through this pandemic. They need help, by electing Jon and the reverend you’ll be sending a powerful message to congress and to the country. It is time for this nation, for god’s sake to finally come together, finally to work together, to unite, to put the anger and the division and the divisive politics to the past, behind us and here’s one more thing, voting for Jon and the reverend won’t just be good for America, it’ll be good for Georgia and here’s why. When you vote for Jon and Raphael, you’ll be sending two senators who will fight for you, who will put Georgia first, who’ll put you first. You don’t have that now. You have two senators that thinks it’s more important to reward wealth than hard work in a tax system. You have two senators now who think they don’t work for you, they work for Trump. I mean it, think about it. You have two senators, who think their loyalty is to Trump, not to Georgia. You have two senators who think they’ve sworn an oath to Donald Trump, not to the Unites States Constitution but let me tell you something. I got elected when I was 29 years old and six more times the United States Senator from Delaware and guess what, not once did I think I took an oath to any president, democrat or republican. I took an oath to the United States Constitution and as president, I don’t believe the United States senators are going to work for me, they work for the people of Georgia. That’s why I’m not asking your senators to be loyal to me, I believe they should be loyal to you, to Georgia, the United States Constitution, period and if you vote for Jon and the reverend, that’s what you’re going to get, decent, honorable men. They won’t put a president or party first and they sure won’t put themselves first. They know public service is about you. It isn’t about them. It’s not about enriching themselves. It’s about making people’s lives better, about giving people a chance, just an even shot, no guarantee but an even shot. It’s time to start rewarding work and not wealth and if you listen to Jon and the reverend, that’s what they’ve been saying, that’s what they’ve been campaigning on. Look, I’m dealing with COVID. I’m revitalizing our economy, our healthcare, our voting rights, criminal justice, racial justice, climate change and the things that matter and will make a difference in your lives and the lives of your families. Georgia, as dark as these days of winter seem, I’m still more optimistic about this country than any time in my entire life. I really mean it. The American people now understand clearly what’s at stake and Jon and Raphael share that optimism. They saw firsthand the power of believing in the promise of America in our darkest months. Jon learned it from my old friend and yours, John Lewis. Reverend Warnock sees the power of faith overcome the toughest trials that life can throw at us. He believes as I do, in the quote of the German philosopher, Kierkegaard who said, “Faith sees best in the dark.” I know they share with me that deep faith in the American people in this country, a faith that enables us to overcome adversity, to lift each other up, to be a beacon of light for one another and for the world. That’s who we are and that we should never give up on. Look folks, I’ve said many times and I’ll say it here again, there’s nothing and I say this again, nothing, nothing, nothing this country isn’t able to do when we decide to do it together. We have faced tougher times before and we’ve always overcome. We’ve always overcome. We’ve always come out better than we went in, no matter what. I know this campaign has been exhausting. You put the hard work in over the last few years to get to this moment. It’s been intense. It’s been non-stop but I’m asking you to give everything you’ve got one more day, one more day and that one more day, this not hyperbole, you can change America. So if you haven’t voted, vote. If you’ve already voted, then I’m asking you one more day of making calls, and safely knocking on doors. Go to iwillvote. com/GA to find your polling location. Just like you did in November, vote, vote, vote. Vote for Jon and the reverend. Vote. In America, as our opposition friends are finding out, all power flows from the people, from the people. That’s our history. That’s our law. That’s our tradition. That’s our constitution. That’s our democracy. Politicians cannot assert, take or seize power. Power if given, granted by the American people alone and we can never give that up. It’s always, always the will of the people must prevail. So today, tomorrow vote. Make sure your voice is heard. Do it for yourselves, do it for your families, do it for your children, do it for your state, your country. Do it for all those who’ve given up so much. Think of all those who’ve given up so much to secure that right. Do it for the country you love, because I know you love this country and the future you want to build for everyone in this country. Do it for all those around the world who aspire like us to be free and a democratic people who look to us. I’ve been in almost a hundred countries, they all look to America. The power, the power is in your hands. Jon, and Reverend Warnock, we’re counting on you, so is Kamala, so am I and so is America. We’re a nation built on honor, decency, dignity and respect. America is and must continue to be a beacon of light, liberty and democracy and unity. That’s who we are. That’s the United States of America. Vote. Vote. Vote. Vote. God bless you all and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you."
"2","01-06-21"," Are Sorry. Not just an inconvenience, but I’m sorry for the reason we’ve delayed, I’ve delayed coming out to speak to you. I initially was going to talk about the economy, but all of you, all of you have you been watching what I’ve been watching. At this hour, our democracy is under unprecedented assault, unlike anything we’ve seen in modern times, an assault the Citadel of Liberty, the Capitol itself, an assault on the people’s representatives and the Capitol Hill Police sworn to protect them, and the public servants who work at the heart of our Republic. An assault on the Rule of Law, like few times we’ve ever seen it. An assault on the most sacred of American undertakings, the doing of the people’s business. Let me be very clear. The scenes of chaos at the Capitol do not reflect a true America, do not represent who we are. What we’re seeing are a small number of extremists dedicated to lawlessness. This is not the dissent. It’s disorder. It’s chaos. It borders on sedition, and it must end now. I call this mob to pull back and allow the work of democracy to go forward. You’ve heard me say before in different contexts, the words of a President matter, no matter how good or bad that President is. At their best, the words of a President can inspire. At their worst, they can insight. Therefore, I call on President Trump to go on national television now, to fulfill his oath and defend the constitution and demand an end to this siege. They storm the Capitol, to smash windows, to occupy offices, the floor of the United States Senate, rummaging through desks on the Capitol, on the House of Representatives, threatening the safety of duly-elected officials. It’s not protest. It’s insurrection. The world’s watching. Like so many other Americans, I am genuinely shocked and saddened that our nation, so long, the beacon of light and hope for democracy has come to such a dark moment. Through war and strife, America’s endured much and we will endure here and we will prevail again, and we’ll prevail now. The work of the moment and the work of the next four years must be the restoration of democracy, of decency, honor, respect the Rule of Law, just plain, simple decency, the renewal of a politics. It’s about solving problems, looking out for one another, not stoking the flames of hate and chaos. As I said, America is about honor, decency, respect, tolerance. That’s who we are. That’s who we’ve always been. The certification of the Electoral College vote, it’s supposed to be a sacred ritual, which we affirm, it’s purpose is to affirm the majesty of American democracy. But today’s reminder, a painful one, that democracy is fragile and to preserve it, requires people of goodwill, leaders who have the courage to stand up, who are devoted, not to the pursuit of power or their personal interests, pursuits of their own selfish interest at any cost, but at the common good. Think what, our children watching television is thinking. Think what the rest of the world is looking at. For nearly two and a half centuries, we, the people, in search of a more perfect union, have kept our eyes on that common good. America is so much better than what we’ve seen today. Watching the scenes from the Capitol, I was reminded as I prepared other speeches in the past, I was reminded of the words of Abraham Lincoln in his Annual Message to Congress, whose work has today been interrupted by chaos. Here’s what Lincoln said. He said, “He shall nobly save or merely lose the last best hope on Earth.” He went on to say, The way is plain, peaceful, generous, just. A way, which if followed, the world will forever applaud and God must forever bless.” The way is playing here too. That should we are. It’s the way of democracy, of respect, of decency, of honor and commitment as patriots to this nation. Not withstanding what I saw today, we’re seeing today, I remain optimistic about the incredible opportunities. There’s never been anything we can’t do, when we do it together. This God-awful display today, is bringing it home to every Republican and Democrat and Independent in the nation, that we must step up. This is the United States of America. There’s never, ever, ever, ever, ever been a thing we’ve tried to do, that we’ve done it together, we’ve not been able to do it. So, President Trump, step up. May God bless America and may God protect our troops and all those folks at the Capitol who are trying to preserve order. Thank you, and I’m sorry to have kept you waiting. Mr. President Elect [inaudible 00:07:43]. … what we’ve seen today. Are you concerned about your inauguration, Sir?"
"3","01-07-21"," You’re all going to have a lot of questions, but I want to focus on the issue today, the judiciary, as well as we were talking about the Attorney General’s office. And so I’ll have plenty of time to ask the questions I know you desperately want to ask about everything from 25th Amendment on, but I’m not going to speak to that today. I want this to be the issue that we focus on because I think it’s so important. Yesterday, in my view, one of the darkest days in the history of our nation, an unprecedented assault on our democracy. An assault, literally, on the citadel of liberty, on the United States Capitol itself. An assault on the rule of law. An assault on the most sacred of American undertakings, ratifying the will of the people in choosing the leadership of their government. All of us here grieve the loss of life, grieve the desecration of the people’s house. What we witnessed yesterday was not dissent. It was not disorder. It was not protest. It was chaos. They weren’t protesters. Don’t dare call them protesters. They were a riotous mob. Insurrectionists. Domestic terrorists. It’s that basic. It’s that simple. And I wish we could say we couldn’t see it coming, but that isn’t true. We could see it coming. The past four years, we’ve had a president who’s made his contempt for our democracy, our constitution, the rule of law, clear in everything he has done. He unleashed an all-out assault on our institutions of our democracy from the outset. And yesterday was but the culmination of that unrelenting attack. He’s attacked the free press who dared to question his power, repeatedly calling the free press the enemy of the people. Language, at the time he first used it, I and others said has long been used by autocrats and dictators all over the world to hold onto power. The enemy of the people. Language that is being used now by autocrats and dictators across the world, only this time with the imperator of an outgoing President of the United States of America. He’s attacked our intelligence services, who dare tell the American people the truth about the effort of a foreign power to elect him four years ago, choosing instead to believe the word of Vladimir Putin over the word of those who’ve sworn their allegiance to this nation, many of whom had risked their lives in the service of this nation. He deployed the United States military, tear gassing peaceful protestors in pursuit of a photo opportunity in the service of his reelection, even holding the Bible upside down. The action that led to an apology from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and an outspoken denunciation of the use of military for domestic political purposes, from scores, scores of former military leaders and Secretaries of Defense, led by Secretary Cheney. He thought he could stack the courts with friendly judges who would support him no matter what, they were Trump judges, his judges. He went so far as to say he needed nine Justices on the Supreme court because he thought the election would end up in the Supreme Court and they would hand him the election. He was stunned, truly stunned, when the judges he appointed didn’t do his bidding and instead acted with integrity, following the constitution, upholding the rule of law, not just once or twice or three times, but over 60 times. Let me say it, over 60 times. In more than 60 cases, in state after state after state, and then at the Supreme Court judges, including people considered “his judges”, Trump judges, to use his words, looked at the allegations that Trump was making determined they were without any merit. Nothing was judged to put this election in question or doubt by any of these judges. You want to understand the importance of democratic institutions in this country, take a look at the judiciary in this nation. Take a look at the pressure it was just subjected to by a sitting president of the United States of America. At every level, the judiciary rose in the moment during this election, did its job, acted with complete fairness and impartiality, with complete honor and integrity. When history looks back in this moment that we’ve just passed through, I believe it will say our democracy survived in no small part because of the men and women who represent an independent judiciary in this nation. We owe them a deep, deep debt of gratitude. And then there’s the attack on the Department of justice, treating the Attorney General as his personal lawyer and the department as his personal law firm. Through it all, we would hear the same thing from this president, my generals, my judges, my Attorney General. And then yesterday, a culmination of an attack on our institutions of democracy. This time, the Congress itself. Inciting a mob to attack the Capitol, to threaten the elected representatives of the people of this nation, and even the vice president, to stop the Congress from ratifying the will of the American people in a just, completed, free and fair election. Trying to use a mob to silence the voices of nearly 160 million Americans who summoned the courage in the face of pandemic that threatened their health and their lives to cast that sacred ballot. I made it clear from the moment I entered this race that what I believe was at stake. I said there was nothing less at stake than who we are as a nation, what we stand for, what we believe, what we will be. At the center of that belief is one of the oldest principles this nation has long held, where our government of laws, not of men, not of the people, of laws. I said it many times in the campaign, our democratic institutions is not relics of another age, they’re what sets this nation apart. They’re the guardrails of our democracy. That’s why there is no president who is a King. No Congress that’s a House of Lords. A judiciary doesn’t serve the will of the president or exist to protect him or her. We have three co-equal branches of government. Co-equal. Our president is not above the law. Justice serves the people. It doesn’t protect the powerful. Justice is blind. What we saw yesterday, in plain view, was another violation of the fundamental tenet of this nation. Not only did we see the failure to protect one of the three branches of our government, we also saw a clear failure to carry out equal justice. [inaudible 00:08:57] used to say in the Senate, excuse a point of personal privilege. Well, over an hour and a half after the chaos started, I got a text from my granddaughter Finnegan Biden, who is a senior in her last semester at University of Pennsylvania. She sent me a photo of military people in full military gear, scores of them lining the steps of the Lincoln Memorial because of protest by Black Lives Matter. She said, “Pop, this isn’t fair.” No one can tell me that if it had been a group of Black Lives Matter protesting yesterday, they wouldn’t have been treated very, very differently than the mob of thugs that storm the Capitol. We all know that’s true and it is unacceptable. Totally unacceptable. The American people saw it in plain view. I hope it’s sensitizing what we have to do. Not many people know it, when Justice Garland and I were talking, we talked about, I think he raised it. The reason for the Justice Department’s forming in the first place. It was back in 1870. We didn’t have a Justice Department before that cabinet. It was formed in 1870 to enforce the civil rights amendment that grew out of the Civil War. The 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments. To stand up to the Klan, to stand up to racism, to take on domestic terrorism. This original spirit must again guide and animate it’s work. So as we stand here today, we do so in the wake of yesterday’s events, events that could not more have vividly demonstrated some of the most important work we have to do in this nation. Committing ourselves to the rule of law in this nation. Invigorating our domestic and democratic institutions. Carrying out equal justice under the law in America. There is no more important place for us to do this work than the Department of Justice that has been so politicized. There’s no more important people to carry out this work than the people I’m announcing today. More than anything, we need to restore the honor, the integrity, the independence of Department of Justice in this nation that has been so badly damaged. And so many former leaders of that department in both parties have so testified and stated that. I want to be clear to those who lead this department, who you will serve. You won’t work for me. You are not the president or the vice president’s lawyer. Your loyalty is not to me. It’s to the law, the Constitution, the people of this nation, to guarantee justice. For Attorney General of the United States, I nominated a man of impeccable integrity, Judge Merrick Garland, one the most respected jurists of our time. Brilliant, yet humble. Distinguished, yet modest. Full of character and decency. The Supreme Court clerk served in the Justice Department during the Carter, Bush 41, and Clinton administrations, where he embraced the department’s core values of independence and integrity. A Federal prosecutor who took on terrorism and corruption and violent crime, always with the utmost professionalism and the duty to the oath he swore. Nominated by President Clinton to be a judge on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, considered the second most powerful court in America. Throughout such a long and distinguished career, Judge Garland has earned the praise and admiration of members of bench and bar, and politicians of both parties. And despite his busy schedule and prestigious positions, he still makes time to volunteer regularly, tutoring students in Northeast DC, as he’s done for 20 years. It’s about character. It’s about character. … it’s about character, it’s about character. It was no surprise why President Obama nominated him, Judge Garland, to the Supreme Court. As I said he embodies honor, decency, integrity, fidelity to the rule of law and judicial independence. To those same traits, he will now bring as Attorney General of the United States, not as a personal attorney to the president, but as the peoples’ lawyer. He’ll restore trust in the rule of law and equal justice under the law. And I fully expect, in the discussions I’ve had, that he will receive a fair hearing and a swift confirmation. And once he’s confirmed, I will move promptly to nominate his replacement on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. I expect that the distinguished nominee will receive a prompt and fair hearing as well. For Deputy Attorney General, I nominate one of the most selfless people I’ve worked with, one of the brightest I’ve worked with. I worked with her during the last administration. A 15 year veteran of the Justice Department, Lisa Monaco. Lisa knows the department inside and out. She is a definition of what a public servant should be; decent, trusting, honorable. And I might add I embarrassed her a moment ago with her other colleagues, and selfless. I offered her other positions that are of “greater consequence,” more prestige. But she wanted to work with you, Judge. She wanted to go back to the Justice Department. A top [flight 00:15:47] prosecutor, took on public corruption, corporate fraud and violent crime. Chief of Staff to the Director of the FBI. The first woman ever confirmed as Assistant Attorney General for National Security, where she elevated cyber security to a top priority. And where it’s even more consequential today, than it was then. At the White House, she was the top Homeland Security and Counter Terrorism advisor to President Obama and me, at every one of the national security meetings. She coordinated our fight against Al-Qaeda and ISIL. She helped lead our response to the Ebola Crisis. When the bombs went off at the finish line on Patriot’s Day in Boston, her hometown, she coordinated the Federal Governments response with local and state law enforcement to get to the bottom of the horrible tragedy. Lisa, I know, I know you will help restore integrity and independence of the Department of Justice that you so revere. As Associate Attorney General, the number three job at the department, I nominate Vanita Gupta. A woman I’ve known for sometime. One of the most respected Civil Rights lawyers in America. Started a career at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. Then onto to ACLU, both organizations to which I belong. And then to the Justice Department during the Obama-Biden administration, where she led the Civil Rights Division. At every step, with every case, she fought for greater equity and the right to right the wrongs of a justice system, where they existed. And she’s done so by bringing people together, earning praise from across the [etiological 00:17:51] spectrum for her approach to solving some of the thorniest problems we face. During the Obama-Biden administration, Vanita was put in charge of investigating the abuse of power in police departments in Ferguson, Missouri and other communities torn apart by acts of violence and racial injustice. She helped institute a common sense police reforms to build greater equity, safety, and trust. She was commended for her work by both law enforcement and those advocating for changes in the criminal justice system. That’s a rare achievement. And it speaks volumes about her capacity to unite people in common purpose, which is what this is all about. Uniting the American people. If confirmed, Vanita will be the first woman of color to serve as Associate Attorney General. And I’m grateful, I’m grateful that Vanita is leaving her current job, leading one of the premier Civil Rights organizations in the world, as she answers the call to serve once again to ensure that our justice system is even more fair, and more equitable. Thank you. For Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, I nominate Kristen Clarke who has spent her career advocating for greater equality and equity in our justice system. The daughter of Jamaican immigrants. Now don’t think this has been designed here. I’m still looking for an Irishman. All kidding aside, the daughter of Jamaican immigrants, Kristen is also one of the most distinguished Civil Rights Attorneys in America. A proud native of Brooklyn, New York, she began her legal career in the very same office she’s now nominated to lead. Her previous tenure with the Justice Department saw her take on some of the most complex Civil Rights cases, from voting rights, to redistricting challenges, to prosecuting hate crimes and human trafficking. She’s earned accolades throughout her career, including as the head of the Civil Rights Bureau for her home state of New York, where she’s led the charge to end the school to prison pipeline and root out discrimination in housing and in law enforcement. She currently leads one of the nations top Civil Rights organizations, where she promotes greater equity, and voting rights, in our education system, in our housing system, in our justice system, and so much more. Now, she’ll return full circle to pursue the vital work where her career began. The Civil Rights division represents the moral center of the Department of Justice. And the heart of that fundamental American ideal that we’re all created equal and all deserve to be treated equally. I’m honored you accepted the call to return to make real the promise for all Americans. To each of you, I thank you for your service, and to your families. And to the American people, this is a team that will restore your trust and faith in our institutions democracy. I chaired the judiciary committee for many years. One of my goals in running in the first place, you may recall, I said when I saw those people coming out of the fields on Charlottesville shouting hate, a young woman killed. And when asked the president said they there are good people on both sides. That’s literally why I ran. There’s no more important and heartfelt effort on my part than restoring, restoring the independence and integrity of our justice department. So may God bless you all. May God protect our troops and those who are sworn to protect the American people. Now I will turn it over to the team, starting with the next Attorney General of the United States, Judge Merrick Garland. Thank you. Thank you President Elect Biden, Vice President Elect Harris, for asking me to serve as the Attorney General of the United States. Thanks always to my wife, children, sisters, late parents, without who’s unstinting support I would not be standing here today. Thanks also to my grandparents who’s decision to undertake the difficult journey to America made all things possible for my family. If confirmed, I look forward to working with these wonderful DOJ veterans. Lisa Monaco, Vanita Gupta, and Kristen Clarke. Entering the Department of Justice will be a kind of homecoming for me. My very first job after serving as a judicial law clerk was to work as a special assistant to then Attorney General Ben Civiletti. Ed Levi, and Griffin Bell the first Attorneys General appointed after Watergate had enunciated the norms that would ensure the departments’ adherence to the rule of law. Attorney General Civiletti undertook to continue their work of crafting those norms into written policies. Those policies included; guaranteeing the independence of the department from partisan influence and law enforcement investigations, regulating communications with the White House, establishing guidelines for FBI investigations, ensuring respect for the professionalism of DOJ’s lawyers and agents, and setting our principles to guide the exercise of prosecutorial discretion. Those policies became part of the DNA of every career lawyer and agent. If confirmed, my mission as Attorney General will be to reaffirm those policies as the principles upon which the department operates. As Ed Levi said at his own swearing in, “Nothing can more weaken the quality of life, or more imperil the realization of the goals we all hold dear, than our failure to make clear by words and deed that our law is not the instrument of partisan purpose. In the decades that followed my first tour of duty at the department, I returned again and again in different roles. As a career line Assistant U.S. Attorney, as a Criminal Division Supervisor, and finally as a Senior Official in the Office of the Deputy Attorney General. In the latter role, I worked with every component of the department. On issues ranging from Civil Rights and antitrust, to domestic terrorism and national security. I also worked directly with line prosecutors and agents in offices from Oklahoma City to Billings, Montana. From Sacramento, California, to New York City. Attorney General, later Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson famously said, “The citizens safety lies in the prosecutor who tempers zeal with human kindness, who seeks truth and not victims, who serves the law and not factional purposes, and who approaches his job with humility.” That was the kind of prosector I tried to be during my years of service at DOJ. In 1997, I left the department to serve the cause of justice in another role, as a judge. I have loved being a judge. But to serve as Attorney General at this critical time, to lead the more than 113,000 dedicated men and women who work at the department to ensure the role of law, is a calling I am honored and eager to answer. As everyone who watched yesterdays events in Washington now understands, if they did not understand before, the rule of law is not just some lawyers turn of phrase. It is the very foundation of our democracy. The essence of the rule of law is that like cases are treated alike. … for the powerful, another for the powerless. One rule for the rich and another for the poor, or different rules, depending upon one’s race or ethnicity. And the essence of its great corollary, equal justice under law is that all citizens are protected in the exercise of their civil rights. Those ideals have animated the department of justice since the very moment of its inception. As President-elect Biden, just recounted the department was founded in the midst of reconstruction, following the Civil War, with its first principle task to ensure compliance with the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments. As historian Ron Chernow wrote, “The new Justice Department would forge its identity in the battle to slay the first incarnation of the KU Klux Klan and its offshoots.” In that battle, the department successfully deployed its considerable resources to ensure civil rights, which were under militant attack. These principles, ensuring the rule of law and making the promise of equal justice under law real are the great principles upon which the department of justice was founded and for which it must always stand. They echo today in the priorities that lie before us. From ensuring racial equity in our justice system to meeting the evolving threat of violent extremism. If confirmed, those are the principles to which I will be devoted as attorney general. President-elect Biden understands this as he said today. And as he has publicly said before, “It’s not my Justice Department, it’s the people’s Justice Department.” He promised that the person he chose to lead the department would have the, “Independent capacity to decide who gets prosecuted and who doesn’t.” Vice-president elect Harris has also publicly stated, “Any decision coming out of the Justice Department should be based on facts, should be based on the law. It should not be based on politics period.” I could not agree more. And I would not have agreed to be considered for attorney general under any other conditions. So thank you both for giving me the opportunity to serve. Mr. President-elect, madam vice-president elect, thank you for this opportunity to return to the Department of Justice and to work alongside this incredible team on behalf of the American people. I also want to thank my family for their love and support, and especially my parents for their lessons, large and small, in what it means to live one’s values. It’s fair to say that I grew up in the Justice Department. It was my privilege for 15 years to serve that institution and to learn so much from its extraordinary people. To learn what it means to be a lawyer in public service. And over the years, I have worn many hats. As a career prosecutor, as a senior official in the FBI and as a leader of the National Security Division. But it was as an assistant US attorney that I learned the Justice Department’s values. I worked directly with communities and victims of crime, and I felt the weight of a prosecutor’s responsibility to ensure not that cases are won, but that justice is done, and that each individual defendant’s rights are protected. These experiences forged in me, a reverence for the Department of Justice as an institution for its people, for its mission, for the enduring values that it represents. The protection of civil rights and civil liberties, safeguarding the public from threats of all kinds and upholding the rule of law. Merrick’s mention of former Attorney General Edward Levy calls to mind. One of my earliest memories as a DOJ lawyer. My first job in the department was as counsel to Janet Reno, the first woman attorney general, a mentor to me and a trailblazer. In the conference room outside her office, she hung a portrait of Ed Levy, a tribute to his role in reaffirming the integrity and independence of the institution after Watergate. And I think she hung that portrait as a testament of sorts to the fact that we are all temporary custodians of the institution. The story goes that when President Ford asked Levy what he thought the department needed most in those days of flagging faith in institutions, Levy responded, “A soul.” Well, the soul of the Justice Department lives in the integrity of its career professionals, in the independence of its investigations and prosecutions and in the principles it brings to bear as it stewards the ideal of justice in America. Today, we are at another inflection point. Some of the challenges we face are familiar. Racial inequality, the need for criminal justice reform, domestic terrorism and threats to public safety. Some of the tasks are enduring, like the importance of working closely with law enforcement to ensure public safety and to build trust in our communities. Some of the challenges are evolving, like mounting cyber threats. I’m confident that the Department of Justice is up to all of these challenges. But what is most critical I think in the days ahead is not actually a challenge at all, but an opportunity. For this team and for the career professionals who make up the Justice Department to reaffirm its norms and traditions. To do justice without fear or favor, to keep the American people safe and to do so always consistent with the rule of law. If confirmed, it will be my honor to once again, work alongside the women and men of the Justice Department as custodians of a remarkable and durable institution. Mr. president-elect, madam vice-president elect, thank you for the opportunity to return home to the Department of Justice. Mr. president-elect, madam vice president, thank you for the opportunity to serve this nation. I want to thank my family and my parents who taught me early on the values that have led me to civil rights work in public service. I am humbled and honored to return to the Department of Justice. It is an institution that I love so, so dearly. And to once again work alongside the exceptional women and men, who every day defend the constitution, enforce our federal laws and seek to create a more perfect do union with deep integrity and without political interference. There are many agencies in the federal government, but actually only one that bears the name of a value. By virtue of that name, that value of justice, we know the department carries a unique charge and North Star. At its best. It is the keeper of a sacred promise. It’s the promise of equal justice for all. That no one is above the law. And when this promise is pursued with vigor, it brings light to our nation and serves as a beacon to the world. But when abandoned, we degrade our democracy, and sew the division that we’ve come to know all too well. The first time I felt the absence of that promise was as a four year old child, one of my earliest memories. My parents were proud immigrants from India, an opportunity that was made possible by the civil rights movement and the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act. One day I was sitting in a McDonald’s restaurant with my sister, mother, and grandmother. And as we ate our meals, a group of skinheads at the next table began shouting ethnic slurs at us, throwing food at us until we had to leave the restaurant. It is an early memory, but one that is seared in my mind. That feeling never left me of what it means to be made to feel unsafe because of who you are. I kept another feeling with me though, too. And that is one that has been ingrained in me by my parents and shared by my husband, whose family fled violence and war in Vietnam and sought refuge on these shores. They believed more than anything in the promise of America, and that loving this country brings with it the obligation to do the necessary work to make it better. Those two feelings for me, converge in the work ahead of us. Yesterday’s horrific events at the Capitol reminded us that our democracy cannot be taken for granted, that our nation has a long history of disinformation, white supremacist violence, mob violence. It also reminded us that our values and our constitution and our democracy, these do not protect themselves, it is people with courage who do that. And I am honored to return to a department that I will push every day for justice, accountability and equality under the law. It will not be enough to restore what has been undermined or lost. This moment demands bold leadership. The Department of Justice, as it has done throughout its storied history will have to uncover and reckon with hard truths, hold people, companies, and institutions accountable to our constitution and laws, drive change where there is injustice and heal a nation that is starving for leadership and decency and hope. Now is the time to ensure that our economic system works for everyone, that we can protect the health and safety of all of the American people, and that we will harness all of the Justice Department’s levers for civil rights, justice and police reform and climate justice and so much more. As the late Congressman John Lewis said, “Democracy is not a state, it is an act.” And I pledge to the American people that if confirmed, I will act for justice every day. I pledge that to you, president-elect, I pledge that to you, vice-president elect. I am honored, deeply honored for the chance to work together with activists for justice, with law enforcement, with this extraordinary team that I’m so humbled to serve, with the incredible women and men at the Justice Department to strengthen our democracy and to make equal justice under law a real promise for all. Thank you so much for this opportunity. Mr. … honor and a privilege to be nominated to return to the Department of Justice and serve the American people at this critical moment in our democracy. I am humbled and exceedingly proud to join the remarkable team that you have put together to pursue the urgent timeless cause of equal justice under law. I stand here today deeply inspired by the example of the late Thurgood Marshall, Constance Baker Motley, and other public servants who dedicated their lives to advancing the cause of justice. We are at a crossroads. If I’m fortunate enough to be confirmed, we will turn the page on hate and closed the door on discrimination by enforcing our federal civil rights laws. Growing up in Brooklyn, New York, my parents instilled in me an unrelenting belief in the principles of hard work and respect for the dignity and humanity of all people. I am deeply thankful full for the trail that my parents blazed. And today, I’m thinking about the pride that I know my mother Pansy, my brother Troy, my sister Karen, and my partner Mustafa are feeling as I take on this challenging new opportunity. As a mom myself now, I see the future of America through the eyes of my son, and honestly, at times I am worried. Will he have full and equal access to the extraordinary opportunities of American life? Will he be able to embrace those opportunities in safety and dignity? Will all of America’s children? Every parent lays awake some nights asking these same questions. I know that my own parents did. I was fortunate to benefit from amazing educational opportunities and plenty of lucky breaks that opened doors for me. But I knew then as I know today that not everyone is blessed with the opportunities that I enjoyed and that awareness has animated my life’s work. It’s what brought me to the Department of Justice where I started my career and it’s what brings me back for this homecoming today. The Department, and especially the Civil Rights Division has always occupied a special place in my heart. The clarion call of equal justice under law is what binds us together as a nation. Now, it’s my honor to return to work alongside the dedicated career professionals who give of themselves every day to make that principle real in the lives of families like mine, in my son’s life, and in the lives of all of our sons and daughters. I know the passion and fearlessness that both the President-Elect and the Vice President-Elect bring to the work before us to restore justice, to heal our nation, and to move us closer to that ideal of equal justice. I’m humbled, honored, and eager to work with them and with this team. Thank you for giving me this opportunity to serve my country as a member of your administration. One of the fundamental principles upon which America’s democracy rests, a principle as sacred as a civic value can be is fidelity to the rule of law. In times of stability, that principle can seem abstract, like something out of a legal textbook that isn’t relevant to our daily lives. But in times of upheaval, we come to realize, to appreciate just how vital the rule of law truly is. What we saw yesterday in our nation’s Capitol was, as the President-Elect has called it, an assault on the rule of law and it has no place in our democracy. So I believe we must ask ourselves two questions about what happened yesterday, what went wrong, and how do we make it right? And I believe the answers require us to recognize that the challenge we’re facing in our country is about more than the actions of the few we watched yesterday. It’s about how to reform, how to transform a justice system that does not work equally for all, a justice system that is experienced differently, depending on whether you’re White or Black, a justice system that is experienced differently if you’re rich or poor, a justice system that’s different depending on whether your job requires you to take a shower before you go to work or requires you to take a shower when you come home after work. We witnessed two systems of justice when we saw one that let extremists storm the United States Capitol, and another that released tear gas on peaceful protesters last summer. The American people have expressed rightly outrage. We know this is unacceptable. We know we should be better than this. The promise of our country is that all people will be treated equally. That’s what the rule of law is supposed to be about. That’s what the ideal of equal justice under law is all about. Like everyone here, I’ve dedicated my career to helping uphold those principles, to attempting to uphold those principles, to helping build a more just and equal America, whether it was as San Francisco’s District Attorney or California’s Attorney General or a United States Senator. And that’s what I have pledged to the President- Elect that I will do as Vice President. The public servants we are announcing today have also dedicated themselves to building a more just and equal America and the roles they will assume are some of the most important in our country, and especially right now. They will be responsible for pursuing justice and ensuring that all Americans are treated equally. They will be the guardians of our justice system. They will have the power to enforce our laws in a more fair and more humane manner, while also holding those who violate the law accountable, whether they be ordinary citizens or law enforcement. They will help protect the rights of every voter in our country no matter what their background or where they live and they will restore integrity and independence to the Department of Justice and rebuild the American people’s trust in that most sacred institution. And I know they will do this because these nominees have the experience, the judgment, and moral compass that these roles demand, as well as an abiding commitment to supporting and defending the constitution of the United States of America. For many centuries, the ideal of justice has been symbolized as a woman blindfolded with a scale in her hands. There is a reason the eyes of that lady justice are covered. It’s because our belief in what a system of justice is says that it should not depend, justice should not depend on how you look, on the color of your skin, on how much money you make. It shouldn’t depend on where you were born or the language your grandmother speaks or what political party you belong to. Justice should be impartial. It should be fair. It should be applied equally. And President-Elect Biden and I, along with this incredible team, will help to make sure it is while restoring and strengthening the rule of law that has always been and always will be the bedrock of America’s democracy. Thank you, Mr. President-Elect. He should be removed. Technical pool, travel pool, we need to load. Let’s go, guys. Let’s load. Let’s go."
"4","01-08-21"," Good afternoon. Before I begin, let me just say two things. One when this is all over, I’ll take questions. When we finish today’s announcements, but let me begin by expressing my deep sympathy for the family of a Capitol Officer Sicknick, who has died in the line of duty, our sympathies and our concerns go out for his family and the people responsible should be held accountable and they will be. But today, I’m pleased to announce the latest members of our economic team. With their announcement, I’m proud to announce we have finished naming our cabinet. I’m saving the best for last here. 24 outstanding women and men who will get our country moving again, and who are going to restore trust in our government again, and all of whom are ready on day one to do their job. This is a cabinet that I promised you and I’ve fulfilled that promise, that looks like America. It taps into the full range of talent we have in our nation. And we have immense talent. It’s an historic cabinet. This’ll be the first cabinet ever that is evenly composed of as many women as men in the cabinet. This will be the first cabinet ever with a majority of people of color occupying this cabinet. And it has more than a dozen history-making appointments, including the first woman secretary of treasury, first African-American defense secretary, the first openly gay cabinet member and the first Native American cabinet secretary. We’re also on track, we named a record 50 high-level appointments that are subject to president confirmation. More than any president ever elected has done. We’ve done our job. We’ve begun my job of naming these people. And it’s my expectation and hope that the Senate will now move to confirm these nominees promptly and fairly. It’s especially the case for the nominees of secretary of state, defense, treasury, Homeland security. I nominated them back in November. Given what our country has been through the last four years, the last few days, given the threats and the risks in this world, they should be confirmed as close to January 20th as possible. They should be no vacancies at state, defense and treasury, and Homeland security. And we will remain in this dark winter of pandemic and with the economic crisis that’s deepening. And we have no time to lose with regard to the entire team. Consider the December jobs report released today. The anxiety and fear of the women and men out there reminds me of when President Obama and I were sworn in during the Great Recession of 2009. This December jobs report shows millions of Americans are still hurting through no fault of their own. We lost another 140,000 jobs. The first negative jobs report since the height of the pandemic in the spring. More people have just lost a job while many have been out of work for a long time. And the ongoing gap between Black and Latino unemployment remains much too large, that gap. And in many ways, the jobs report is a pandemic report. With the pandemic raging, people are losing work and losing hope. The hospital industry, restaurants and bars lost more than 372,000 jobs. State and local governments are slashing jobs. 20,000 local educators lost their jobs just last month. In the midst of this pandemic, there are millions of people out of work, unable to pay the rent or their mortgage. They’re waiting in line for hours to get food from a food bank. Think of this. The United States of America, people are lined up for miles in their automobiles waiting to get a meal to put on the table to feed their family. And they’re left staring at the ceiling, so many. Unable to sleep. Worried, will they have their health insurance? Wondering if they’ll be okay? The bottom line is the job report shows we need to provide more immediate relief for working families and businesses now. Now. Not just to help them get the other side of this painful crisis, but a larger purpose to avoid a broader economic cost that exists out there, that will happen due to long-term unemployment, hunger, homelessness, and business failings. But by acting, the vast majority of leading economists suggest that’s what we need to do to revive the economy. In fact, economic research confirms that with conditions like the crisis today, especially with such low interest rates, taking immediate action, even with deficit finance, is going to help the economy long term and short term reduce scarring in the workforce, increase growth and reduce our national debt burden. [Farragut 00:09:25] act will have the opposite effect. I’ve said before, the bi-partisan COVID relief package passed in December was a very important step, but just a down payment. Next week, I’ll be here with you all laying out the groundwork for the next COVID economic relief package that meets the critical moment of our economy and our country that we face at the moment. For example, vaccines give us hope, but the rollout has been a travesty. This would be the greatest operational challenge. The greatest operational challenge we will ever face as a nation. We’re going to need billions of dollars to get the vaccines from a vial into someone’s arm in the vaccination for millions of Americans. We’re also going to need tens of millions of dollars to help reopen our schools and reopen them safely. State, local, tribal communities need tens of billions of dollars to keep educators, police officers, firefighters, and other first responders and public health workers on the job. We need more direct relief flowing to families, small businesses, including finishing the job of getting people that $2,000 in relief direct payment. 600 are simply not enough when you have to choose between paying rent, putting food on the table, keeping the lights on. I also hope that democratic control of the house and Senate will raise the odds of prompt action on increasing the minimum wage. I’ve long said that we need to reward work, not just wealth in this country. People in both parties now recognize it’s time to raise the minimum wage so hardworking people are in at least $15 an hour minimum. No one should work, as millions are doing today, 40 hours a week at a job and still live below the poverty line. They’re entitled to at least the $15 minimum wage per hour. Folks, a big focus has also being small businesses and how to correct the current administration’s failures to get relief to main street, small businesses that are most in need. Mom and pop stores are the backbone of the economy. And they’re also, as you all know, they’re the glue that holds communities together. It holds them together. But today, more than one in four small businesses are not open. At least 400,000 are closed for good. As the month goes by, a third of Black-owned businesses and more than a fifth of Latino-owned businesses and more than a quarter of Native American-owned businesses, have less than one month of reserves to cover expenses. Previous rounds of economic relief last year helped millions of small businesses stay afloat and keep employees in the payroll. But there were clear problems. Black and Brown owned, small businesses had less access to that relief. Mom and pop shops were often the last in line, while big well-connected businesses jumped in front of the line and got more relief and got it faster. And at every turn this administration, the Trump administration, has undermined accountability for every tax dollar spent. Weakening oversight, firing inspector generals. So it’s no surprise an independent watchdog found that tens of thousands of ineligible companies receive relief they should not have, including from fraud and abuse, siphoning off support for very small businesses that need it so badly. But the good news is that the relief package passed last month provides additional aid to small businesses and workers. But as I said from the beginning, the need to make sure that relief and future relief reaches everyone who needs it, we need to do more. These relief dollars will start to flow quickly potentially while the current administration is still in office and they may send out money that they won’t have any control over, but for what we have to control… need control over, I want to be very clear what my priorities are. For distributing this emergency aid swiftly and equitably. Our focus will be on small businesses on main street that aren’t wealthy and well-connected, that are facing real economic hardships through no fault of their own. Our priority will be Black, Latino, Asian, and Native American owned small businesses, women owned businesses, and finally having equal access to resources needed to reopen and rebuild. But we’re going to make a concerted effort to help small businesses in low income communities. In big cities, small towns, rural communities that have faced systemic barriers to relief. Think of the mom and pop owner with a couple of employees, who can’t pick up the phone and call a banker, who doesn’t have a lawyer, an accountant, to help them through this complicated process to know if they’re even qualified or who simply didn’t know where this relief is available in the first place. We went through this, Don, when we were trying to bring… When we brought Detroit back off it’s knees. As we saw in this morning’s job report, restaurants, bars, and hospitality industry have been slammed by this virus. We’re going to direct relief to those businesses and others that have been so badly hit. Hit the hardest. We owe them that support to help them get through the other side of this crisis. And I promise you, we will investigate and prosecute waste and fraud in these programs. So the money goes to the companies that deserve it and will use it to help their employees and their communities. When my president, President Obama, asked me to handle implement the recovery act, along with Don who helped me a great deal, we invested more than $800 billion in our economy to help recover, rebuild and less than two thirds of 1% waste, fraud or abuse occurred. We know how to do this. We know how important predictability and clarity are to small businesses. From day one, this administration worked to ensure that small businesses and financial institutions in every community understand the rules for these programs, the resources available to them, where they can turn for technical assistance if they need it. We will have navigators who help guide them through each step of this process until the money they need is in their bank account. And to the lenders participating in these programs, you should move quickly without delay to begin extending relief. But I urge you not to disperse these funds in the same inequitable way you have in the past. Here’s my commitment. In return, we’ll make our expectations of you crystal clear, the banks, so that you can quickly and equitably deliver relief to the communities that you serve, unlike what’s been happening in many places. The bottom line is, we’re in the midst of the most unequal economic and jobs crisis in modern history. Congress needs to act as quickly as possible on all the issues I just laid out. That’s how we can contain the pandemic, build back better, with an economy that works for all Americans. And this is a team that’s going to help get that done. For secretary of commerce, I nominate Governor Gina Raimondo of Rhode Island. The daughter of a working class family who knows what it’s like when her parent’s factory job was shipped overseas. She never took her parents’ sacrifices for granted. She always remembers where she came from. She became a successful entrepreneur who created jobs on main street and brought businesses back from the edge. She became a state treasurer who investing in local communities and took on financial predators. And today she’s one of the most effective forward-thinking governors in the United States of America, the first woman ever to lead the Ocean State. She created an innovative loan program that helped minority-owned and women-owned businesses access the capital they need, but wasn’t always available to them. She’s worked with employers to design skill training programs so the local workers would be equipped to take the good paying jobs in their own communities. She’s put Rhode Island on the path to achieving 100% renewable energy, and she’ll be a key player in helping position the United States as a global leader in the 21st century in clean energy economy. And she knows what her fellow governors, Democrats and Republicans alike, are dealing with on the front lines of the pandemic and economic crisis they’re facing and how we can all partner together as one nation to contain COVID-19 to build back better. I’m honored Governor that you’re willing to join the administration. And we’re really looking forward to working with you. For secretary of labor, I nominated a good friend and a standup guy, Marty Walsh of Boston, son of Irish immigrants from… His only downside, they’re not from Mayo, they’re from Galway. From Galway, moved to Boston. Marty was born and raised in Dorchester. I know him. Tough as nails. Diagnosed with cancer at age seven, beat it at age 11, joined the Laborers Union to 23. At age 21, elected to the state legislature, became union president and graduated from college at age 42. He’s now in his second term as a successful mayor of the iconic American city of Boston, who always puts working people first. Fighting for a $15 minimum wage. First, fighting for $15 minimum wage, paid family leave, providing frontline workers with emergency childcare, and protective equipment they need. Marty understands like I do, the middle-class built this country and unions built the middle class. He sees how union workers have been holding this country together during this crisis, health care workers keeping our hospitals safe, clean and effective, and efficient, I might add. Public service workers, fighting against budget shortfalls to keep communities afloat. Port workers, car haulers, warehouse workers, folks keeping our air and rail systems running. They’re literally what’s keeping us going. And they deserve a secretary of labor who knows how to build our power as workers. Who knows that when I say our future will be made in America, it will be a future built by American workers. A future with historic investments in infrastructure, clean energy manufacturing, and so much more that’s going to create millions of good paying jobs. Marty knows worker power means not just protecting the right to unionize, but encouraging unionization, and collective bargaining. The Fair Labor Standards Act way back didn’t just say you can have union, it said the government should encourage the formation of unions. It also means protecting pensions, ensuring worker safety, increasing the minimum wage, ensuring workers are paid for the overtime they’ve earned, like we fought for in the Obama-Biden administration, that this administration has weakened. Making sure that we have a trade policy, where for every decision we make, unions are at the table, focused on winning good jobs for American workers. This is one of the most important departments to me. I Trust Mayor Walsh and I’m honored he accepted. But I also want to say, I did give serious consideration of nominating my friend, Bernie Sanders to this position before. I’m confident he could have done a fantastic job. I can think of no more passionate, devoted ally to working people in this country. But after two of these results in Georgia, give me a democratic control of the United States Senate, and a tie vote, Bernie and I agreed, matter of fact Bernie says, “We can’t put control of the Senate at risk, on the outcome of a special election Vermont. And he agreed we couldn’t take that chance. We also discussed how we’d work together, travel the country together, helping Marty meeting with working men and women who feel forgotten and left behind in this economy. We agreed that we’ll work closely on our shared agenda of increasing worker power and to protect the dignity of work for all working people. I want to thank Bernie for his continued friendship and leadership. I look forward to us working together along with Marty, and he thinks I made a good choice. For administrative of the small business administration I nominate, Isabel Guzman. Isabel grew up in California, working alongside her dad in a small veterinary business that he built. She devoted an early understanding and developed an early understanding of what small business means to their employees and to the neighborhood they support, and to the families who dreams they represent. She dedicated her career to creating jobs, to supporting entrepreneurs as a senior official on the Obama-Biden small business administration. As director of California’s office of small business and a small business advocate, she worked tirelessly to ensure that everyone with an entrepreneurial spark had a fair and equal shot at getting off the ground and succeeding. The Biden-Harris administration will be locked in on helping small businesses recover, rebuild, and remain the engines of our economic strength. And as head of the SBA, Isabel will be leading the critical mission, not only to rescue small businesses in crisis, but to provide the capital to entrepreneurs across the country, so they can innovate, create jobs and help lead us into recovery. I’m grateful that she accepted the call to serve in Washington. For deputy commerce secretary I nominate, and I have to admit to you good loyal great friend, Don graves. Don is a long time and trusted advisor. He was there at the treasury department during the depths of the great recession, helping small businesses weather the storm and stay afloat. When President Obama asked me to lead the effort to get Detroit out of bankruptcy, and off its back and on its feet again, he said, I can take anyone in the administration on my team to do it full time. So I went to the treasury department. I tasked Don to come over and work for me and work on full-time. It was the best decision I ever made in that effort. I’m not sure how he thinks about that, but I think it was the best decision I’ve ever made. And did a great job working with the city officials, state officials on its road to recovery. And by the way, it’s the little things, it’s getting to know what’s happening on the ground. Remember how we went through the issue about the number of buses and lights, street lights and light. It gets down to the nitty gritty of what has to be done. We found out that Detroit had a lot of qualified people, but during the great recession, almost everyone who knew how to program anything left. And when we finally got it back on it’s feet again, we found out there wasn’t anybody left to know how to turn on the street lights. Literally, run the sewer department. So we went out and we got an outfit to come in and we said, find us some high-tech people. They came back, what was it, 53, 55 people, they all happened to be women. Most were minority, none had more than a high school degree, and a quarter of them only had a GED. And I remember even our very liberal friends we told them we were doing this. They said, “You’re not going to do this. Well, guess what? In a 14 week, was it 14 week, program, they were taught how to program. They were taught how to do it all. They ended up putting the city back on its feet. Every one of them left after that time, because we went to the graduation, with the lowest starting salary if my recollection is correct, was $49,000, the highest $104,000. Point is, give people a chance, Americans can do anything, given a shot. It also helped me lead our national strategy to equip workers with the skills they need for good paying jobs in the 21st century and healthcare, IT, clean energy, advanced manufacturing and so much more. He was there to help me launch the National Cancer Moonshot, and marshall a full resource of the federal government to help end cancer as we know it. A cancer survivor himself, diagnosed and treated while he was working on this for me. Don knows about hope and he knows about resilience. I’m grateful to him. And it was a wonderful family. For once again, answering the call to serve. I want to thank you all. Thank your families. And I don’t want to embarrass them. There’s one guy up in the gallery here, Tommy, who’s my buddy, who is the son of the governor. Thanks Tommy for supporting mom doing this. And to American people, I know these times are tough, but I want you to know that we’re going to get through this. Help is on the way. These people know what they’re about, they know what it’s like. May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Now what I’d like to do is turn this over to the team, starting with our next secretary of labor, Marty Walsh, and after all said and done, what I’ll do is I’ll come back and answer some questions. Thank you. Marty, the platform is yours pal. Thank you. Good afternoon? Good afternoon. Mr. President elect, Madam vice president elect, thank you for this chance to work for the American people. I begin by thanking my amazing family, my wonderful husband, Andy, my daughter Ceci, my son Tommy who’s here in the balcony, thank you for your endless love and support. We’ll do this as a family. The mission of the commerce department is a very simple one. To help spur good paying jobs, to empower entrepreneurs to innovate and grow, to come together with working families and American businesses to create new opportunities for all of us. It’s a simple but vital mission. It’s the same mission that’s driven my own life and the path of my family across generations. My grandfather was 14 years old when he came to this country. He got on a boat by himself at 14 years old from Italy. He came to America in search of new possibilities. He taught himself English late at night in the Providence Public Library, the library was open late at night. He started a family, and the first chapter of our family’s new American story. My father was the son of another Italian immigrant, a butcher. A butcher who helped found the Meat Cutters Union in Rhode Island, which is now the UFCW local in Rhode Island. And after serving in the Navy and going to college and the GI bill, my father went to work in manufacturing, spending most of his career at the Bulova Watch factory in Providence. Now, I was the youngest of three kids, and there were six of us, including my grandfather, all in a small house, sharing one bathroom. Now we didn’t have a lot, but we had everything that we needed, until one day my dad came home and he said the factory was going to close, and the jobs were going overseas. And so after 28 years of dedicated work, he was pushed unceremoniously into early retirement in his mid 50s. I have to tell you, it was a very difficult time for my family. And like so many American families across this country today, we had to cut back, cut back to make it through. But my mom kept our family together and we did get through. And I went on to college, and I started to chase my own dreams, starting business, and creating jobs for hardworking people. Because I knew exactly what those jobs would mean. What those jobs would mean for families who had fallen on hard times, for communities where the factory had shut down, and for a state that needed a shot in the arm to get back on its feet. When I announced my run for governor, Rhode Island was in the midst of an eight month streak as the state with the highest unemployment rate in the nation. But over the last six years, we’ve worked hard, we fought back and we’ve grown our way back, achieving a record number of jobs and the lowest unemployment rate in over 30 years. Now, we did that by bringing together our workers and businesses, working together, coming together in common cause. We invested in our people, in their skills, their opportunities and their dreams. We helped new businesses launch, and we sparked others to hire and grow responsibly. That’s the same vision, the same faith in American workers in American entrepreneurs that I see in the Build Back Better agenda. It’s a vision for an inclusive recovery, that lifts up those who’ve been left behind. It’s a vision for a national effort that provides skills, training and wraparound supports to get Americans back to work. It’s a vision for rebuilding American manufacturing and bringing back jobs to America from overseas. And that’s why I am ready to get to work. I am excited to get to work on a national scale to help realize the vision of the president elect and vice president elect to help more hardworking families in every community write the next chapter of their own American stories. So thank you for this opportunity to serve the American people. Thank you, governor Raimondo and I look forward to working with you in my role as well. Mr. President elect, Madam vice president elect, I want to thank you for the opportunity to serve the American people. The word labor means everything to me. As you mentioned earlier, Mr. President elect, my mother and father came to this country as immigrants from Gallway, which is an Island, but from a part of Galway called Kanamara. They brought with them, their willing hands, their honest hearts and hopes to the American dream. But all they needed because my father joined the Labor’s Union in Boston, was that opportunity. And that’s why my parents were able to raise my brother, John and myself, with dignity and security, and in multi-ethnic, multi-racial working class neighborhood of Dorchester in the city of Austin. I followed my father into that union. I learned what it took to turn an honest day’s work into an honest day’s pay. I saw it fighting for good jobs, good benefits, a safe workplace does for the lives of hardworking men and women and their families. And I fought for working people every single day of my life since then. Today we’re at a crossroads in America. It’s a time of great hardship. Working people are holding the country together right now. I’ve seen it up close as mayor of the city that I love Boston. Health care workers, first responders, grocery store workers, delivery drivers, postal workers, sanitation workers, custodians, coming through for us, under impossible conditions. But this isn’t just because of the COVID crisis or the economic crisis that threatens their wellbeing. Working people have been struggling for a long time under the erosion of their rights in the deep inequalities of race, gender, and class. For the last four years, they’ve been under assaults, attacks on their rights, their livelihoods, and the unions that built the middle class. We are facing hard times, but nobody’s tougher than the American worker. And now, we have the opportunity to put power back in the hands of working people all across this country. And that is a good thing for our economy and for our country. We can defend workers rights. We can strengthen collective bargaining. We can grow union membership. We can create millions of good paying jobs with investments in infrastructure, clean energy, and in high-tech manufacturing, along with the workforce training to help get those people into those good jobs. This team, the Biden-Harris team has the plans to make this happen. Mr. President elect, we spent many memorable days together in my hometown, at a rally to support grocery store workers fighting for their rights, and my inauguration as mayor. And on a day that I will never forget, at the Boston Marathon Memorial, where you lifted out our whole city spirits. So I know that from Dorchester to Scranton, Wilmington to West Virginia and all across this great nation, your home in your heart are with the working people. I look forward to working with you to deliver good jobs with dignity, security, prosperity, and purpose to all American families. And I look forward to working with this entire administration shoulder to shoulder, with American workers to build back our country better. Thank you once again for this incredible honor, may God bless the American worker and may God bless the United States of America. Good afternoon. Mr. President elect, Madam vice president elect, I am honored and truly thankful for this opportunity to serve America’s small businesses. … serve America’s small businesses. Together with you and the exceptional and diverse team you’re assembling, I am eager to build our economy back better in every community. The small business experience is personal to me. I grew up in an entrepreneurial family. My father started his first veterinary hospital when I was one years old. And I recall early childhood memories of tagging along with him to the hospitals, to check on the animals under his care. As I grew older, I worked alongside my dad at the family business, and witnessed his dedication to his clients, his employees, and the community. I saw him spending endless hours wearing multiple hats, tirelessly working to learn more and grow the business. Those memories have defined my career, and really inspired my work still today. Along my own path, I have partnered to start businesses, and have helped entrepreneurs launch and grow their firms. I have advised a startup minority owned bank, and I have co-founded a consulting firm for small business contractors. At the US Small Business Administration, I was honored to help make a difference on a national scale. I formed a deep passion for the SBA’s work, providing loans, investments, contracts, and counseling, to help entrepreneurs start and grow and spur job creation. Today as California’s small business advocate, I support the small businesses and innovative startups, of this fifth largest economy in the world, focusing on ensuring the economy works for everyone, as that’s how we thrive together. Now I’m honored to return to the SBA at a crossroads moment for small businesses, the dreams they embody, the people they lift up, and the communities they serve. So many small businesses across the country have been devastated by the pandemic and economic crisis. A disproportionate impact has fallen as it often does, on our businesses owned by people of color. Small businesses have had to adapt quickly to survive, and chase down relief while facing closures, drops in revenues, shrinking cashflow, and increasing debt. I know you believe wholeheartedly Mr. President-elect and Madam Vice President-elect, that all of our small businesses are critical to our collective success as a nation. Their American dreams fuel our economy, bring new ideas to transform our lives for the better, and enliven every main street in America. And now more than ever, our small businesses need us. I share your commitment to help strengthen these many small business owners, who have seen their dreams and their livelihoods impacted by COVID-19. And to create opportunities and instill greater equity in all of the new startups that will lead us to recovery. I am excited to get to work with the incredible mission driven civil servants at the SBA, to help America’s small business owners build better future. … to ensure that economic opportunity is inclusive and broad based. And as it is for all of us in our own ways, it’s personal. I come from a long line of small business owners, including one who owned and operated the only African-American owned hotel, in the mid to late 1800s, just four short blocks from where the Commerce Department sits today. But for too many people in this country, the chance to start and grow a business, to take their idea into market and sell all over the world, remains elusive all these years later. But we also know that government, its resources, and its experienced and capable civil servants, can help level the playing field and empower people, communities, and our economy to reach their full potential. Mr. President-elect, I saw it firsthand when you and President Obama prevented another great depression, and helped us recover, rebuild, and put us on the way to resurgence. I saw it in Detroit, where we were able to provide the partnership to help residents, businesses, and leaders get their city back on the feet again. And as we traveled the country meeting with local leaders, labor unions, business leaders, and educators, I saw how you brought people together to ensure American workers were equipped.and matched with the skills for jobs in their own communities. That also strengthened the economic competitiveness of our nation. Above all, you showed me how to do it the right way. To understand that service isn’t about those who serve, but the people we serve. Just spend the extra time to really understand what they’re going through, and to know they aren’t looking for us to solve everything, but to understand and help make their lives better. I felt that most through the Cancer Moonshot you launched, deeply personal to both our families. And that gave the American people a renewed sense of hope, in what we can do as a nation. With Governor Raimondo, Mayor Walsh, Isabel, and the entire economic team, we will govern by that high standard that you and the Vice President-elect, continue to serve, to show. To revive the economy through the pandemic and build it back better. To advance racial equity across the board, and to meet the existential threat of climate change with American jobs and ingenuity. With your leadership, I know this administration will provide the American people the support they need to thrive, and the opportunity to turn their hopes into lives of dignity, and the respect they deserve. Thank you again for the opportunity to serve. Thank you [inaudible 00:45:53]. [inaudible 00:45:55]. One of the fundamental values that the president-elect and I share, is a belief in the dignity of work. We both understand that a job is so much more than just a paycheck. It’s about dignity and respect. Joe learned that lesson from his father, and I learned it from my mother. My mother taught me in her words and in her actions, that no matter how you earn a living, whether you’re a caregiver or a truck driver, a grocery store clerk, or a small business owner, every job has inherent value and worth. And every worker everywhere has a right to earn a living wage, work in safe and healthy conditions, and pursue a better life for themselves and their family. We also know that right now the dignity of an honest day’s work, and the financial stability of a steady income, are out of reach for millions of Americans. The December jobs report makes that very clear. Food banks as the president-elect has said, are being strained, trying to feed people who’ve had to worry for the first time in their lives, about where they can find their next meal. Essential workers like the nurses Joe and I called over the holidays, continue to risk their own health and the health of their families for all of us. Small business owners from restaurants to barbershops to dry cleaners, they’re hurting. And let’s be clear, those who run America’s small businesses, they’re not just business leaders, they are civic leaders, they are community leaders. They’re the ones who sponsored the little league team, and scholarships for local kids and all kinds of local causes and activities. They’re the ones who are role models in their communities. And we’ve got to do right by them. So first and foremost, as the president-elect has said, we will provide more immediate relief, we must, for working families and businesses now. And even as we address our immediate crises, even as we work to contain this pandemic and open our economy responsibly, we must also do what President-elect Biden and I have pledged to do. We must build our economy back better. So that lift ups everyone. No matter what you do for living or where you live, whether it’s in a small town, a big city or anywhere in between. And that means providing access to capital for small business owners, the economic engines of our neighborhoods. So that they can create the jobs that are in our communities and help our communities thrive. It means making sure we’re equipping workers with the skills they need, for the jobs of the future, and making sure our entrepreneurs and businesses, continue to out innovate and out-compete the rest of the world. And it means protecting and expanding workers’ rights, by fighting for a higher minimum wage and paid leave, safe and healthy workplaces, and stronger unions. From working with unions, the San Francisco’s district attorney to helping author the Domestic Workers Bill of Rights in the United States Senate, I can tell you from personal experience that whether it’s the apprenticeships of the building trades, or the caregiving skills of home healthcare workers, this is some of the most important work being done in our country. The president-elect and I know that, and so does this team we are announcing today. These are leaders and I’ve worked with many of them. Who together with the rest of our economic team, will help create millions of good paying union jobs, and build an economy that is stronger and fairer for working people. They are seasoned public servants with track records of not only standing up for workers in unions, but creating and spurring innovation and creating opportunities for small business owners. And like President-elect Biden and I, they will fight to honor the dignity of work. The president-elect and I share a vision of America where opportunity is within reach for all the people. Where everyone can see a better and a brighter future for themselves, and for their children. With the leadership of these public servants and our entire economic team, we will get to work building that America, less than two weeks from today. Thank you so very much Mr. President-elect. Thank you. Okay guys. Well folks, let me take some of your questions. Will have chances again this week to do it. But [inaudible 00:52:08] can you tell me who was talking. Mr. President-elect, while we have been here as you’ve been announcing your economic team, we’ve learned that House Democrats are currently planning to introduce articles of impeachment against President Trump, as soon as Monday. At that point it’ll be just a little over a week before the president leaves office. Look, I’ve thought for a long, long time, that President Trump wasn’t fit to hold the job. That’s why I ran. And my job now in 12 days, God willing I’ll be president of United States of America. And I’m focused on the urgency of three immediate concerns. One, the virus. Getting it under control. Getting the vaccine from a vial into people’s arms. I think the way it’s being done now has been very, very sad. Number two, we’ve had 4,000 deaths yesterday. And things continue to rise to escalate. That’s my number one concern, to get the virus under control. We lost over 125,000 jobs this last month, and people are really, really, really in desperate shape. And so I’m focused on the virus, the vaccine, and economic growth. What the Congress decides to do, is for them to decide. But I’m going to have to, and they’re going to have to be ready, to hit the ground running, because when Kamala and I are sworn in, we’re going to be introducing immediately, significant piece of legislation to deal with the virus, deal with the economy, and deal with economic growth. So we’re going to do our job and the Congress can decide how to proceed with theirs. I’ll tell them that’s a decision for the Congress to make. I’m focused on my job. I’ll be speaking with Nancy and the Democratic leadership this afternoon as a matter of fact, about my agenda, as well as whatever they want to talk to me about. Okay. Thanks. [inaudible 00:54:59]. Thanks Mr. President-elect. Thank you Ken. I wanted to ask you about your agenda in light of the jobs report that came out today. You’re going to be laying out the principles of your plan. Do you think that the need in the COVID relief bill is greater than you anticipated? And what is the price tag that you’re looking at? I’ve been told it could be in the two to three trillion dollar range. And then as it relates to the direct cash payments, you’ve talked about the need for $2,000 checks. We’re going to be proposing an entire package. And parts of that package are of equal consequence to people. Unemployment insurance, being able to continue with rent forbearance, a whole range of issues. And so that’s number one. We think that they all have to be dealt with. The price tag will be high. But as I said, made scant reference to in my opening comments. The overwhelming consensus among the leading economists left, right and center, is that in order to keep the economy from collapsing this year and getting much, much worse, we should be investing significant amounts of money right now to grow the economy. And that’s a pretty wide consensus. And as you know, Moody’s had done an analysis of what I originally had been talking about, and said that it was necessary to keep the economy from going down. We’d rise. We’d create 18.6 million jobs, create two trillion dollars more in economic growth than the other administration would, this outgoing administration. So it is necessary to spend the money now. The answer is yes. It will be in the trillions of dollars, the entire package. I’ll be here next Thursday laying out in detail, how that package is going to go. But the basic story is simple, that if we don’t act now things are going to get much worse and harder to get out of the hole later. So we have to invest now. Secondly, we’re going to have to meet the emergency needs of the American people. I mean literally, I know you know this Ken. That people are having trouble just putting food on the table. Just having to stay, keep the payment of their car, being able to turn the lights on. There’s a dire, dire need to act now, purely out of what is a humanitarian need here at home. In the third stage of this the whole story is, we’re going to have to invest as I suggested throughout the campaign, in infrastructure and healthcare and a whole range of things, that are going to generate good paying jobs, that will allow us to grow the economy. So that’s a long answer to your short question. Which is that, the idea of with interest rates as low as they are, with the fed having had its power sort of taken away in terms of what they could do to help this administration like last, it’s important across the board, every major economist thinks we should be investing in deficit spending in order to generate economic growth. And I wanted to ask you about what took place at the Capitol this week. You served in the Senate for 36 years, and importantly you were there in 1983 when there was an explosion in the Senate quarter, you were there in 1998 when two Capitol police officers were shot. You were there during the anthrax attacks in 2001, what kind of an investigation needs to take place, and what steps need to take place to improve the security of the Capitol. Yes. They should be treated as they’re a bunch of thugs, insurrectionist, white supremacists, anti-Semites, [Six N 00:19:20] is not enough. I mean, come on. These shirts they’re wearing, these are a bunch of thugs, thugs, and they’re terrorists, domestic terrorists. And that’ll be a judgment for the Justice Department to make as to what the charges should be. But the fact is they should be prosecuted. They should be prosecuted. The difference here is, this had the active encouragement of a sitting president of the United States. And the way in which the breakdown in security occurred, needs to be thoroughly investigated. … idea. The idea that these people were able to just march up the stairs, march in, and do it in the way … There’s a great debate, I don’t know the answer, a great debate now. Was the governor of Maryland correct when he said that, “I was ready to send in the National Guard. I couldn’t get authorization.” What happened? It deserves a full-blown investigation, people being held accountable, and steps taken that something like this could never happen again. And the difference this time is, every nation has dealt, every democracy has dealt with individual terrorist attacks by groups that are very targeted. The largest target was 911 and the buildings. Well, right down to a bomb going off in the Capitol when I was there and two policemen. But the idea that thousands of people, thousands of people, could be marching up the steps of the United States Capitol, breaking windows, breaking doors, forcing their way in, stepping aside, and the photographs of … Well, I don’t know what the circumstance is. The photograph of, it looked like you had some of the Capitol Police taking selfies with these people. That has to be thoroughly investigated. The authorities responsible have to be held accountable for the failures that occurred, and we have to make sure that this can never ever happen again. The damage done to our reputation around the world by a president of the United States encouraging a mob, a mob, this reminded me more of states I’ve visited of the hundred countries I’ve gone to in tinhorn dictatorships. It just cannot be sustained, has to be immediately, immediately investigated in depth, and people have to be held accountable. Totally different entity is in charge of the inauguration that was in charge of protecting the Capitol, the Secret Service. I have great confidence in the Secret Service. I have great confidence in their ability to make sure that the inauguration goes off, goes off safely, and goes off without a hitch, so I have confidence in the planning that’s been underway before this and continues with the Secret Service as the lead agency. Thank you. Thank you. [inaudible 01:02:34]. President-elect Biden, Vice President-elect Harris, good to see you both. I want to pick up on something that you just said about President Trump actively encouraging the insurrection at the Capitol. Look, I’ve been saying for now well over a year, he is not fit to serve. He is not fit to serve. He’s one of the most incompetent presidents in the history of the United States of America, and so the idea that I think he shouldn’t be out of office yesterday is not the issue. The question is, what happens with 14 days left to go, or 13 days left to go? And I think that what 81 million people stood up and said, it’s time for him to go, and the United States Senate voted 93 to 6 to confirm that we should be sworn in, we were duly elected. So I think it’s important we get on with the business of getting him out of office. The quickest way that that will happen is us being sworn in on the 20th. What action happens before or after that is a judgment for the Congress to make. But that’s what I am looking forward to, him leaving office. I was told on the way up here, the way over here, that he indicated he wasn’t going to show up at the inauguration. One of the few things he and I have ever agreed on. It’s a good thing him not showing up. Earlier you’d said that you’d hope that he would show up only in the sense that it was valuable to send a signal to the world about the transfer of power. You’ve clearly changed your perspective on that. Because he has clearly demonstrated, he’s exceeded even my worst notions about him. He’s been an embarrassment to the country, embarrassed us around the world, not worthy, not worthy to hold that office. If we were six months out, we should be moving everything to get him out of office, impeaching him again, trying to invoke the 25th Amendment, whatever it took to get him out of office. But I am focused now on us taking control as president and vice-president on the 20th, and to get our agenda moving as quickly as we can. Thank you. Another question about holding public officials to account, and this is about an issue that’s no longer a headline but is no less significant and serious. It’s about the more than 600 children who were orphaned under the Trump Administration as a result of the family separation policy along the border. During the campaign you said that practice was criminal. I’ll commit that our Justice Department and our investigative arms will make judgements about who is responsible, how they’re responsible, and whether or not the conduct is criminal, across the board. But as I said yesterday, I am not going to tell the Justice Department who they should prosecute and who they should not. That’s a judgment that will be made by the Attorney General of the United States of America, not influenced by me. But there will be a thorough, thorough investigation of who’s responsible and whether or not the responsibility is criminal. And if that is concluded, the attorney general will make that judgment. I will not intervene to tell him who he should or shouldn’t indict, or if he should indict. Lastly, beyond the COVID plan which you’ve detailed, what are your legislative priorities? You’ve talked about infrastructure. You’ve talked about introducing an immigration bill. After January 20th you’ll control, Democrats rather will control the House and the Senate. Three different issues there in that same question. One, the commitments I made that what I would introduce, not necessarily we would move to but introduce in the United States Congress first, I will do. I will introduce an immigration bill immediately and have it sent to the appropriate committees to begin movement. I will in fact, countermand executive orders that the president has in fact initiated that are contrary to what I think is either his authority, and/or, even if it’s his authority, contrary to the interests of the United States on environmental issues and a whole range of other things. Thirdly, I will immediately move though to the most urgent need of asking the Congress to give me the financial wherewithal to deal with the virus, to deal with the virus, to be able to move so that we have Operation Warp Speed really working. Warp Speed, got the vaccine to places that were delivered, but did not get them from those vials into people’s arms, and so it is a gigantic logistical concern of how we do that. I’m committed to get 100 million shots in people’s arms in the first 100 days. I’m committed to insisting that at all federal jurisdictions, any place I have control as president, everyone will be mandated to wear a mask, in interstate transportation as well as federal facilities. Thirdly, I’m committed to moving as rapidly as possible to get the vaccine to teachers and the material to children that can provide for the safe opening of our schools beginning at the end of that hundred days. They’re the most urgent things we have to do now, now, immediately upon getting into office. There’s going to be multiple things, as you well know, because you’re a seasoned veteran of how we work. And that is that there will be other committees will be holding hearings on a whole range of issues from my positions on infrastructure, what we should be doing to generate a green economy, and so on. But in terms of the immediate need to get done, not just introduced, but to get done, voted on and get the money and resources to do it, it turns out that the most urgent need is dealing with the virus, number one, and economic relief to Americans who through no fault of their own are really getting battered. Thank you. Thank you both. [inaudible 01:09:29]. Thank you, Mr. President-elect and Madam Vice President-elect. I want to follow up with respect to what you just said about the inauguration and that it’s a good thing that the president is not coming. He’s welcome. I think it’s important that as much as we can stick to what have been the historical precedents of how and the circumstances under which an administration changes should be maintained. And so the Vice President is welcome to come, we’d be honored to have him there, and to move forward in the transition. No, I haven’t. I think it makes my job easier, quite frankly. I’ve had a number of my Republican colleagues, former colleagues, I used to serve in the Senate for a long time, call me. Many of them are as outraged, and disappointed, and embarrassed, and mortified, by the president’s conduct as I am and Democrats are. And I have said from the beginning, and I have not changed my view, my overarching objective is to unify this country. We must unify the country, and I think that … You’ve heard me say this before, and I apologize for repeating myself, but understandably the questions are repetitive, and good. I mean I’m not being critical of the question, and that is that there’s two ways people are inspired. By inspirational leaders and by terrible leaders, by terrible leaders. What this president has done is ripped the bandaid all the way off to let the country know who he is, and what he’s about, and how thoroughly unfit for office he is. And you see already a number of Republicans … I was so proud. I know we’re on opposite sides. I’ll get criticized from some of the people in my party for saying this, but I’ve worked very hard with and against the soon to be former Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell. I thought what he said on the floor of the United States Senate was in fact the right thing to do. He stood up. He’s ashamed. I spoke with a guy I have enormous respect for, enormous respect for, and I ran against him, Mitt Romney. I spoke to Mitt this morning again. This is a man of enormous integrity, enormous integrity, who lives his faith. There are so many more, but there’s others who should be ashamed of themselves. But they make up a minority of the Republican Party. This isn’t about Republican-Democrat anymore. This is about people who understand what this country’s about and the things we have to agree on and move together on. I just think that if you look at it, speaking to some of my Republican colleagues, and I’ve spoken to a number of them over the last month since we’ve been elected, through recently as the day in which this God-awful debacle was taking place up on The Hill. I think they understand that we need a Republican Party. We need an opposition that’s principled and strong. I think you’re going to see them going through this idea of what constitutes the Republican Party. And to hear some of my Republican colleagues talk about how shameful it is of the way Ted Cruz and others are dealing with this, how they’re responsible as well for what happened. Well, I think they should be just flat beaten the next time they run. I think the American public has a real good clear look at who they are. They’re part of the Big Lie, the Big lie. I was being reminded by a friend of mine. Maybe you were with me, I can’t recall, when we were told that, Goebbels and the great lie. You keep repeating the lie, repeating the lie. Well, there was a print that when Dresden was bombed, firebombed, there were 250 people that were killed. Or was it 2,500 people were killed? And Goebbels said, no, 25,000 or 250,000 were killed, and our papers printed that. Our papers printed it. It’s the Big lie. People will know this. One thing for one man, one woman, to repeat the lie over, and over, and over again. By the way, Trump said that before he ran, “If you say it enough, I’m going to convince you. I’ll say it enough.” The press is bad. The press is bad. The press is bad. The press is bad. If he’s the only one saying it, that’s one thing, but the acolytes that follow him like Cruz and others, they are as responsible as he is. And so it’s not about whether or not they get impeached, it’s about whether or not they can continue to hold power because of the disgust the American people have for their actions. There are decent people out there who actually believe these lies because they’ve heard it again and again. I was with a friend of mine who’s a medical doctor, telling me that his neighbor said to him, he lives in another state. His neighbor’s a good person and said, “But you know, doc, this is true. There’s a lot of, there’s a lot of, a lot of chicanery that went on in this election.” He said, “Tell me what.” “Well, I just know there was. They say it is. They say it is.” This is the human condition. You say it, and say it, and say it, and say it. The degree to which it becomes corrosive is in direct proportion of the number of people who say it. And so it’s interesting to me, and I was pleased to hear some of the more prominent Republicans say to me that the Ted Cruzes of the world are as responsible in terms of people believing the lies, not as responsible but similarly responsible, like Trump. But they didn’t say, “Go to the Capitol. I’ll be with you, follow.” That’s a different story. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you all very, very much. I appreciate it. Thank you. Mr. President-elect, one more about the [inaudible 01:16:30] vaccine. [inaudible 01:16:28]. Mr. The answer is, I’ll be talking about that on Friday. On Thursday, Thursday. On Thursday?"
"5","01-11-21"," Ready, set, go. Thanks, man. Appreciate it. Mr. I do. Let me make a couple of brief statements. Number one, my number one priority is getting vaccine in people’s arms. Like we just did today, as rapidly as we can. And we’re working on that program now. I’ll be meeting on a Zoom call with my team a little later this afternoon. And I put together, which I’ll be announcing on Thursday, laying out the plan, the cost of how I want to proceed, the cost of what we have to do to be able to get the entire COVID operation up and running. 3,000 to 4,000 people a day dying is just beyond the pale. It’s just wrong. And we can do a lot to change it, number one. It’s going to be hard, it’s not going to be easy, but we can get it done. And secondly, wearing this mask, socially distancing, and making sure people are washing their hands on a regular basis is critically important. I was appalled when I saw, as a matter of fact, it was the distinguished Congresswoman from the State of Delaware, was when they showed the folks when they were in hiding, in effect, from the mob, she was going around trying to hand out masks for everybody. And the Republican colleagues wouldn’t take the masks. They think it’s irresponsible. And so we all have to make sure it’s not a political issue. It’s an issue of public safety and it’s going to get worse before it gets better in the mean time. I’m confident we can get done what we have to get done. I’ve been speaking with some of my Republican colleagues about being able to move on a second package sooner than later, but I’ll be making further presentation to you all on Thursday as exactly how much I’m looking for and the process by which [inaudible 00:03:01]. No, I’m not. Okay, guys. Thank you. Let’s go. Come on, guys. Back to the vans. Thank you. Wait, wait, wait. I can, because I haven’t seen these guys in a long time. I’m not afraid of taking the oath outside. We’ve been getting brief, but I am… I think it’s critically important that there be a real serious focus on holding those folks who engaged in sedition and threatened people’s lives, defaced public property, caused great damage, that they be held accountable. And I think that’s a view that is held by the vast majority of Democrats and Republicans in the Congress. Well, look, my priority is to get first and foremost, the stimulus bill passed and secondly, begin to rebuild the economy in a way that I’ll be laying out on Thursday. I had a discussion today with some folks in the House, in the Senate. And the question is whether or not, for example, if House moves forward, which they obviously are, with the impeachment and send it over to the Senate, whether or not we have [inaudible 00:04:28] can bifurcate this? Can you go half day on dealing with impeachment, and half day getting my people nominated and confirmed in the Senate, as well as moving on the package? That’s my hope and expectation. I don’t know. I haven’t gotten an answer from the [inaudible 00:04:49] yet. Great. Come on, guys. [crosstalk 00:04:54]. Let’s go. Right back up out the same door we can. Thank you, guys. Thank you, guys. Thank you. Let’s go. Come on, let’s go. I think President Trump should not be in office. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Thank you, guys. Let’s go. I see you over here. Yeah, he missed you. Of course, he did. [crosstalk 00:05:19]. Be careful. Come on. Let’s go. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Thank you, guys. Let’s go."
"6","01-14-21"," Good evening, my fellow Americans. It’s been 343 days since the virus that has ravaged our nation tragically claimed its first life. On February the 6th in 2020 Patricia Dowd took her last breath at home under the California sun in Santa Clara. She was 57 years old, a beloved wife, mother, daughter, sister. She never knew she had the virus, at the time when most folks never heard about the virus, but just like that she was gone. And almost exactly one year later, nearly 400,000, 400,000 of our fellow Americans have met the same cruel fate. Countless families and friends left behind with unrelenting grief and guilt, anger and frustration. And the emptiness felt by the loss of life is compounded by the loss of our way of life. During this pandemic, millions of Americans, through no fault of their own, have lost the dignity and respect that comes with a job and a paycheck. Millions of Americans never thought they’d be out of work. Many of them never even envisioned the idea, are facing eviction, waiting for hours in their cars to feed their families, as they drive up to a food bank. Millions have kept their jobs, but have seen their hours and paychecks reduced barely hanging on as well. That’s happening today in the United States of America. Just as we are in the midst of a dark winter of this pandemic, as cases, hospitalizations and deaths spike at record levels, there is real pain overwhelming the real economy. One where people rely on paychecks, not their investments to pay for their bills and their meals and their children’s needs. You won’t see this pain if your scorecard is how things are going on wall street, but you will see it very clearly if you examine what the twin crises of a pandemic and this sinking economy have laid bare. The growing divide between those few people at the very top who are doing quite well in this economy and the rest of America. Just since this pandemic began, the wealth of the top 1% of the nation has grown roughly $1.5 trillion since end of last year, four times the amount for the entire bottom 50% of American wage-earners. Some 18 million Americans are still relying on unemployment insurance. Some 400,000 small businesses have permanently closed their doors. And it’s not hard to see that we’re in the middle of the once in several generations economic crisis with a once in several generations public health crisis. The crisis of deep human suffering is in plain sight and there’s no time to waste. We have to act and we have to act now. This is what economists are telling us. More importantly, it’s what the values we hold dear in our hearts, as Americans are telling us. Our growing chorus of top economists agree that in this moment of crisis, with interest rates at historic lows, we can not afford inaction. It’s not just that smart fiscal investments, including deficit spending, are more urgent than ever, it’s that the return on these investments in jobs, racial equity, will prevent long-term economic damage and the benefits will far surpass the cost. A growing number of top economists have shown, even our debt situation will be more stable, not less stable if we seize this moment with vision and purpose. And so tonight I’d like to talk to you about our way forward. A two-step plan of rescue and recovery, a two-step plan to build a bridge to the other side of the crisis we face to a better, stronger, more secure America. Tonight, I’ll lay out my first step, the American rescue plan that will tackle the pandemic and get direct financial assistance and relief to Americans who need it the most. Next month, in my first appearance before a joint session of Congress, I will lay out my Build Back Better recovery plan. It’ll make historic investments in infrastructure, that Build Back Better plan. Infrastructure, manufacturing, innovation, research, and development, and clean energy, investments in a caregiving economy and skills and training needed by our workers to be able to compete and win in the global economy of the coming years. Moody’s, an independent Wall Street firm, said my approach will create more than 18 million good paying jobs. Our rescue and recovery plan is a path forward, with both seriousness of purpose and a clear plan with transparency and accountability with a call for unity that is equally necessary. And unity is not some pie in the sky dream, it’s a practical step to getting the things we have to get done as a country get done together. As I said when it passed in December, the bi-partisan COVID-19 relief package was a very important first step. I’m grateful for the Democrats, Republican and Independent members of Congress who came together to get it done. But I said at the time, it’s just a down payment. We need more action, more bipartisanship, and we need to move quickly, we need to move fast. Our rescue plan starts aggressively in order to speed up our national COVID-19 response. The vaccines offer so much hope and we’re grateful to the scientists and researchers and everyone who participated in the clinical trials. We’re also grateful for the rigorous review and testing that has led to millions of people around the world already being vaccinated safely. But the vaccine rollout in the United States has been a dismal failure thus far. Tomorrow I will lay out our vaccination plan to correct course and meet our goal of 100 million shots at the end of my first 100 days as president. This would be one of the most challenging operational efforts we have ever undertaken as a nation. We’ll have to move heaven and earth to get more people vaccinated, to create more places for them to get vaccinated, to mobilize more medical teams, to get shots in people’s arms, to increase vaccine supply and to get it out the door as fast as possible. We’ll also do everything we can to keep our educators and students safe, to safely reopen the majority of our K through eight schools by the end of the first 100 days. We can do this if we give the school districts, the schools themselves, the communities, the states, the clear guidance they need as well as the resources they need, that they can’t afford right now because of the economic dilemma they’re in. That means more testing and transportation, additional cleaning and sanitizing services in those schools, protective equipment and ventilation systems in those schools. We need to make sure that workers who have COVID-19 symptoms are quarantined and those who need to take care of their family members with COVID-19 symptoms should be able to stay home from work and still get paid. This will reduce the spread the virus and make sure workers get the support they need to maintain their families. But we need about 400 billion in funding from Congress to make all of what I just said happen. It’s a great deal, but I’m convinced we are ready to get this done. The very health of our nation is at stake. Our rescue plan also includes immediate relief to Americans, hardest hit, and most in need. We will finish the job of getting a total of $2,000 in cash relief to people who need it the most. The $600 already appropriated is simply not enough. You just have to choose between paying rent and putting food on the table. Even for those who have kept their jobs, these checks are really important. You see, if you’re an American worker making $40,000 a year with less than $400 in savings, maybe you’ve lost hours, or maybe you’re doing fewer shifts driving a truck or caring for the kids or the elderly. You’re out there, putting your life from the line to work during this pandemic and worried every week that you’ll get sick, lose your job or worse. $2,000 is going to go a long way to ease that pain. It will also provide more peace of mind for struggling families by extending unemployment insurance beyond the end of March for millions of workers. That means that 18 million Americans currently relying on unemployment benefits, while they look for work, can count on these checks continuing to be there. Plus, it will be a $400 per week supplement so people can make ends meet. This gets money quickly into the pockets of millions of Americans who will spend it immediately on food and rent and other basic needs. As the economists tell us, that helps the whole economy grow. It will also tackle the growing hunger crisis in America. As I speak, and the Vice President Elect has spoken to this many times, one in seven households in America, more than one in five Black and Latino households in America, report they don’t have enough food to eat. This includes 30 million adults and as many as 12 million children. It’s wrong, it’s tragic, it’s unnecessary, it’s unacceptable. So we’re going to extend emergency nutritional assistance for 43 million children and their families enrolled in the SNAP program through the rest of this year. We’ll help hard hit restaurants prepare meals for the hungry, provide food for the families who need it. We will invest $3 billion in sure mothers and their young children have the nutrition they need. This will not only meet our moral obligation we have to one another, but it’ll also spur economic growth, get restaurants and workers back on the job. And as we work to keep people from going hungry, we’ll also work to keep a roof over their heads, to stem the growing housing crisis and evictions that are looming. Approximately 14 million Americans have fallen behind on rent, many at risk of eviction. If we don’t act now, there’ll be a wave of evictions and foreclosures in the coming months as the pandemic rages on. This would overwhelm emergency shelters, increase COVID-19 infections as people have nowhere to go and can’t socially distance. Next week, we’ll take action to extend nationwide restrictions on evictions and foreclosures. This will provide more than 25 million Americans greater stability instead of living on the edge every single month. And I’m asking Congress to do its part by funding rental assistance for 14 million hard hit families and tenants. It will also be a bridge to economic recovery for countless mom and pop landlords. These crises are straining the budgets of states and cities and tribal communities that are forced to consider layoff and service restrictions of the most needed workers. It means that people putting their lives at risk are the very people now at risk of losing their jobs, police officers, firefighters, all first responders, nurses, educators. You know, over the last year alone, over 600,000 educators have lost their jobs in our cities and towns. Our rescue plan will provide emergency funding to keep these essential workers on the job and maintain essential services. It will ensure that vaccines are administered and schools can reopen. Vice President Elect Harris and I had been speaking with county officials, mayors, governors of both parties on a regular basis. We’re ready to work with them to help them get the relief they need. Our rescue plan will also help small businesses that are the engines of our economic growth, our economy as a whole, the glue that holds communities together as well. But they’re hurting badly and you realize they account for nearly half of the entire total us workforce. Our rescue plan will provide flexible grants to help those hardest hit small businesses survive the pandemic and the low cost capital that will help entrepreneurs of all backgrounds create and maintain jobs, plus provide the essential goods and services that communities depend upon. Last week, I laid out how we will make sure that our emergency small business relief is distributed swiftly and equitably, unlike the first time around. We’re going to focus on small businesses on Main Street, we’ll focus on minority owned small businesses, women owned small businesses and finally having equal access to the resources they need to reopen and to rebuild. And we will be responsible with taxpayers’ dollars, ensuring accountability that reduces waste and fraud and abuse like we did in the Recovery Act that I administered in our administration. Direct cash payments, extended unemployment insurance, rent relief, food assistance, keeping essential frontline workers on the job, aid to small businesses. These are the key elements to the American Rescue Plan that would lift 12 million Americans out of poverty and cut child poverty in half. That’s 5 million children lifted out of poverty if we move. Our plan will reduce poverty in the Black community by 1/3, to reduce poverty in the Hispanic community by almost 40%. And it includes much more like an increase in the minimum wage to at least $15 an hour. People tell me that’s going to be hard to pass, Florida just passed it. As divided as that state is, they just passed it. The rest of the country is ready to move as well should be a national minimum wage of $15 an hour. No one working 40 hours a week should live below the poverty line. That’s what it means. If you work for less than $15 an hour and work 40 hours a week, you’re living in poverty. It includes access to affordable childcare that will enable parents, particularly women to get back to work. I look forward to working with members of Congress in both parties, to move quickly to get the American Rescue Plan to the American people. Then we can move with equal urgency and bipartisanship to my Build Back Better recovery plan that I will call for next month to generate even more economic growth. American manufacturing was the arsenal of democracy in World War II. It will be so again. Imagine a future made in America, all made in America and all by Americans. We’ll use taxpayers’ dollars to rebuild America. We’ll buy American products, supporting millions of American manufacturing jobs, enhancing our competitive strength in an increasingly competitive world. Imagine historic investments in research and development to sharpen America’s innovative edge in markets where global leadership is up for grabs, markets like the battery technology, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, clean energy. Imagine confronting the climate crisis with American jobs and ingenuity leading the world. It’s time to stop talking about infrastructure and to finally start building an infrastructure so we can be more competitive. Millions of good paying jobs that put Americans to work, rebuilding our roads, our bridges, our ports, to make them more climate resilient, to make them faster, cheaper, cleaner to transport American made goods across our country and around the world. That’s how we compete. And imagine millions of jobs in the caregiving economy to ease the financial burden of caring for young children and aging loved ones. Let’s make sure our caregivers, mostly women, women of color, immigrants have the same pay and dignity that they deserve so we can do these bold practical things now. Now. I know what I just described does not come cheaply, but failure to do so will cost us dearly. The consensus among leading economists is we simply can not afford not to do what I’m proposing. Independent, respected institutions from around the world, from the Federal Reserve to the International Monetary Fund have underscored the urgency. Even Wall Street firms have reinforced the logic. If we invest now boldly, smartly and with unwavering focus on American workers and families, we will strengthen our economy, reduce inequity and put our nation’s longterm finances on the most sustainable course. And where we’re making permanent investments, recurring investments. As I said on the campaign trail, we will pay for them by making sure that everyone pays their fair share, not punishing anybody. You can do it without punishing a single person by closing tax loopholes for companies that ship jobs overseas or that allow American companies, 90 of them in the top Fortune 500, to pay zero in federal income taxes. Asking everyone to pay their pair of fair share at the top, so we can make permanent investments to rescue and rebuild America. It’s the right thing for our economy. It’s the fair thing. It’s the decent thing to do. We not only have an economic imperative to act now, I believe we have a moral obligation. In this pandemic in America, we can not let people go hungry. We can not let people get evicted. We can not watch nurses, educators, and others lose their jobs, we so badly need them. We must act now and act decisively. My fellow Americans, the decisions we make in the next few weeks and months are going to determine whether we thrive in a way that benefits all Americans or that we stay stuck in a place where those at the top do great, while economic growth for most everyone else is just a spectator sport and where American prospects, dim, not brighten. These investments will determine whether we reassert American leadership and out-compete our competitors in a global economy. We’re better equipped to do this in any nation in the world or that we watch them catch up and pass us by. Together, I know which path we’ll choose. And that includes all Americans, so we can own the 21st century. But even with all these bold steps, it’s going to take time to get where we need to be. There will be stumbles, but I will always be honest with you about both the progress we’re making and what setbacks we meet and there will. And here’s the deal, the more people we vaccinate, the faster we do it, the sooner we can save lives and put this pandemic behind us and get back to our lives and our loved ones and the sooner we can rescue and rebuild the American economy, the biggest and most profitable engine in the world. I know it’s been a nearly a year. It’s tested us beyond measure. For all of you who have lost someone, my heart goes out to you. I know that feeling, looking at an empty chair across the table. All of you who’ve fallen on hard times, I know you can never get back what you lost, but as your president, I know that every day matters and every person matters. And the very first, to the nearly 400,000 lost American souls and counting, to the millions of you just looking for a fighting chance in this economy, I promise you, we will not forget you. We understand what you’re going through. We will never ever give up and we will come back. We’ll come back together. We didn’t get into all this overnight. We won’t get out of it overnight. And we can’t do it as a separated and divided nation. The only way we can do it is to come together, to come together as fellow Americans, as neighbors, as the United States of America. And when we do, there’s nothing beyond our capacity, I’ve said this many times. When America acts as one, there’s never been a single thing we’ve been unable to do no matter how consequential the issue has been. Out of all the peril of this moment, I want you to know, I give my word, I see the promise as well. We’ve seen clearly what we face now and I remain so optimistic about America, as optimistic as I’ve ever been. We have everything we need, but the will must be demonstrated. So come Wednesday, we begin a new chapter, the vice president elect and I will do our best to meet all the expectations you have for the country and the expectations we have for it. I’m confident. I am truly confident together, together we can get this done and come out better off than when we went into this crisis. God bless you all and may God protect our troops."
"7","01-15-20"," All right, so let’s begin right now. Just this month, the United States and Iran were on the brink of war, which has reignited the debate over America’s role in the world and which of you is best prepared to be commander-in-chief. So let’s have the debate right now. When the Congress was debating whether or not we go into a war in Iraq, invade Iraq, I got up on the floor of the House and I said that would be a disaster, it would lead to unprecedented levels of chaos in the region. And I’d not only voted against the wall, I help lead the effort against that wall. Just last year, I helped for the first time in the modern history of this country, pass a War Powers Act Resolution, working with a conservative Republican, Mike Lee of Utah, which said that the war in Yemen, led by Saudi Arabia was unconstitutional because Congress had not authorized it. We got a majority vote in the Senate. We got a majority vote in the House. Unfortunately, Bush vetoed that and that horrific war continues. I am able to work with Republicans. I am able to bring people together, to try to create a world where we solve conflicts over the negotiating table, not through military efforts. Vice President Biden, you talk a lot about your experience, but some of your competitors have taken issue with that experience, questioning your judgment in voting to authorize the Iraq war. I said 13 years ago, it was a mistake to give the President the authority to go to war, if in fact he couldn’t get inspectors into Iraq to stop what thought to be the attempt to get a nuclear weapon. It was a mistake and I acknowledged that. But the man who also argued against that war, Barack Obama picked me to be his Vice President and once we were elected President, and Vice President, he turned to me and asked me to end that war. I know what it’s like to send a son or daughter and like our colleague has gone to war in Afghanistan, my son for a year in Iraq and that’s why I do it very, very reluctantly. That’s why I led the effort as you know, Wolf against surging tens of thousands of troops into Afghanistan. We should not send anyone anywhere unless the overwhelming vital interest of United States are at stake. They were not at stake there. They were not at stake in Iraq and it was a mistaken vote. But I think my record overall on every other thing we’ve done has been… I’m prepared to compare it to anybody’s on this stage. Senator Sanders, you have been attacking Vice President Biden’s vote on the Iraq war, but you recently acknowledged that your vote to authorize the war in Afghanistan was also a mistake. So you’ve both acknowledged mistakes. Well, it’s a little bit of a difference on that particular vote, every single member of the House, including myself voted for it, only Barbara Lee voted against it. But what I understood from right away in terms of the war in Iraq, the difference here is that the war in Iraq turned out to be the worst foreign policy blunder in the modern history of this country. As Joe well knows, we lost 4,500 brave troops, hundreds of thousands of Iraqis died. We have spent trillions of dollars on that endless war, money which should go into healthcare and education and infrastructure in this country. Joe and I listened to what Dick Cheney and George Bush and Rumsfeld had to say. I thought they were lying. I didn’t believe them for a moment, I took to the floor I did everything I could to prevent that war. Joe saw it differently. Vice President Biden. I was asked to bring 156,000 troops home from that war, which I did. I led that effort. It was a mistake to trust that they weren’t going to go to war. They said they were not going to go to war. They said they were just going to get inspectors in. The world, in fact voted to send inspectors in and they still went to war. From that point on, I was in the position of making the case that it was a big, big mistake and from that point on, I moved to bring those troops home. Senator Klobuchar, you’ve publicly questioned Mayor Buttigieg’s experience when it comes to being Commander in Chief. Thank you Wolf, and I’ve been very clear that I respect the mayor’s experience very much in the military. I just have different experience. I’ve been in the US Senate for over 12 years and I think what you want in a President is someone who has dealt with these life and death issues and who has made decisions. I will look at my position on the Iraq war first. I wasn’t in the Senate for that vote, but I opposed that war from the very beginning. In my first campaign for Senate, I ran against a Republican who ran ads against me on it, but I stood my ground. When I got to the Senate, I pushed to bring our troops home. Then I have dealt with every issue from Afghanistan, to keeping our troops with good healthcare, after what we saw with Walter Reed and being part of an effort to improve the situation for our troops in a very big way with their education and with their jobs and also with their healthcare. I think right now what we should be talking about though, Wolfe, is what is happening right now with Donald Trump. Donald Trump is taking us pell-mell toward another war. We have a very important resolution. We just found out today the four Republicans are joining Democrats to go to him and say, “You must have an authorization of military force if you’re going to go to war with Iran.” That is so important because we have a situation where he got us out of the Iranian nuclear agreement, something I on for a significant period of time. As President, I will get us back into that agreement. I will take an oath to protect and defend our constitution and I will mean it. Thank you, Senator Klobuchar. We are going to continue talking about who’s best prepared to be Commander in Chief Mayor Buttigieg. Well, I bring a different perspective. There are enlisted people that I served with, barely old enough to remember those votes on the authorization after 9-11, on the war in Iraq, and there are people now old enough to enlist who were not alive for some of those debates. The next President is going to be confronted with national security challenges, different in scope and in kind from anything we’ve seen before. Not just conventional military challenges, not just stateless terrorism, but cybersecurity challenges, climate security challenges, foreign interference in our elections. It’s going to take a view to the future, as well as the readiness, to learn from the lessons of the past and for me, those lessons of the past are personal. Senator Warren and our new CNN Des Moines Register poll, almost a third of your supporters say your ability to lead the military is more of a weakness than a strength of yours. Why are you best prepared to be Commander in Chief? E. I believe the principal job of the Commander in Chief is to keep America safe and I think that’s about judgment. I think it starts with knowing our military. I sit on the Senate Armed Services Committee. I work with our generals, with our military leaders, with our intelligence, but I also visit our troops. I visit our troops around the world. I’ve been to Afghanistan, to Iraq, to Jordan, to South Korea. I’ve been to lots of places to talk with our troops. And I fight for our troops to make sure that they get their pay, that they get the housing and medical benefits that they’ve been promised, that they don’t get cheated by giant financial institutions. E. I have three brothers who are in the military and I know how much our military families sacrifice, but I also know that we have to think about our defense in very different ways. We have to think about cyber. We have to think about climate. We also have to think about how we spend money. We have a problem with a revolving door in Washington, between the defense industry and the Department of Defense and the Pentagon. That is corruption, pure and simple. We need to block that revolving door and we need to cut our defense budget. We need to depend on all of our tools, diplomatic, economic, working with our allies and not let the defense industry call the shots. Mr. Steyer, you worked in finance for decades and have never held elected office. I worked internationally around the world for decades. I traveled, I met with governments, I met with business, and I understand how America interacts with other countries. And you asked what is the reason that the experience really counts? And to me, I believe that Senator Warren made a great point. It isn’t so much about experience, it’s about judgment. If you’ve been listening to this, what we are hearing is 20 years of mistakes by the American government in the Middle East, of failure, of mistakes. So the real question is judgment. And if you look who had the judgment, it was a State Senator from Illinois with no experience named Barack Obama who opposed the war. It is a Congress woman, Barbara Lee from Oakland, California, who stood up against the original vote, who was the only person in Congress. So I would say to you this, an outside perspective looking at this and actually dealing with the problems as they are is what we’re looking for now. I agree with Senator Warren, we are spending dramatically too much money on defense. The money that we’re spending there, we could spend in the other parts of the budget and it’s time for someone from the outside to have a strategic view about what we’re trying to do and how to do it. Senator Sanders, in the wake of the Iran crisis, Iran, Ayatollah Khamenei has again called for all US troops to be pulled out of the Middle East, something you’ve called for as well. Yet when American troops last left Iraq, ISIS emerged and spread terror across the Middle East and indeed around the world. Okay, let me tell you, but before I tell you that, let me tell you something else. And that is, and I don’t know if my colleagues here will agree with me or not, maybe they will. But what we have to face as a nation is that the two great foreign policy disasters of our lifetimes are the war in Vietnam and the war in Iraq, both of those wars were based on lies. And right now what I fear very much is we have a President who is lying again and could drag us into a war that is even worse than the war in Iraq. To answer your question, what we need to do is have an international coalition. We cannot keep acting unilaterally. As you know, the nuclear deal with Iran was worked on with a number of our allies. We have got to undo what Trump did, bring that coalition together and make sure that Iran never gets a nuclear weapon. Vice President Biden. I was part of that deal to get the nuclear agreement with Iran, bringing together the rest of the world and including some of the folks who aren’t friendly to us and it was working. It was working, it was being held tightly. There was no movement on the part of the Iranian government to get closer to a nuclear weapon. And look what’s happened, he went ahead and it was predictable from the day he pulled out of the agreement, Trump, what exactly would happened. We’re now isolated. We’re in a situation where our allies in Europe are making a comparison between the United States and Iran, saying both ought to stand down, making a moral equivalence. We have lost our standing in the region, we have lost the support of our allies. The next President has to be able to pull those folks back together, re-establish our alliances and insist that Iran go back into the agreement, which I believe with the pressure applied as we put on before we can get done. I would leave troops in the Middle East in terms of patrolling the Gulf, where we are now, small numbers of troops. And I think it’s a mistake to pull out the small number of troops that are there now to deal with ISIS. What’s happened is, now that he’s gone ahead, the President and started this whole process moving, what’s happening? ISIS is going to reconstitute itself. We’re in a position where we have to pull our forces out. Americans have to leave the entire region and quite frank, I think he’s flat out lied about saying the reason he made the strike was because our embassies were about to be bombed. I would leave some troops there, but not in the level that Donald Trump is taking us right now. Afghanistan, I have long wanted to bring our troops home, I would do that. Some would remain for counter terrorism and training. In Syria, I would not have removed 150 troops from the border with Turkey. I think that was a mistake. I think it made our allies and many others much more vulnerable to ISIS. And then when it comes to Iraq, right now I would leave our troops there despite the mess that has been created by Donald Trump. At the briefing we had last week, I was the only person on this stage that asked a question of both the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State. And I asked them about imminent threat, but I also ask them what their alternatives were and they gave very vague, vague answers. I asked them where is the surge of diplomacy that we would be seeing if I was President? And I asked them where they were going to leave the Iraqi people? Time and time again, you see that this President puts his own interest, his private interests in front of our countries. I would put our country’s interests first as Commander in Chief. So Senator Warren, leave combat troops, at least some combat troops in the Middle East or bring them home? E. No, I think we need to get our combat troops out. You know, we have to stop this mindset that we can do everything with combat troops. Our military is the finest military on earth and they will take any sacrifice we ask them to take, but we should stop asking our military to solve problems that cannot be solved militarily. Our keeping combat troops there is not helping. We need to work with our allies. We need to use our economic tools. We need to use our diplomatic tools. E. Now look, I understand there are people on this stage when it comes to Afghanistan, for example, who talk about five more years, 10 more years. Shoot Lindsay Graham talks about leaving troops there for a hundred more years. No one has a solution and an end point. We need to get our combat troops out. They are not helping create more safety for the United States or the region. Well, I’ll tell you what. There’s a difference between combat troops and leaving special forces in a position. I was part of the coalition that put together 68 countries to deal with stateless terror, as well as failed States, not us alone, 68 other countries. That’s how we were able to defeat and end the caliphate for ISIS. They’ll come back if we do not deal with them and we do not have someone who can bring together the rest of the world to go with us, with small numbers of special forces we have, to organize the effort to take them down. If we can continue to remain engaged without having an endless commitment of ground troops. But what’s going on right now is the President’s actually sending more. The very President who said he was going to end endless war, who pretended to have been against the war in Iraq all along. But we know that’s not true. Now has more troops going into the Middle East. And whenever I see that happen, I think about the day we shipped out and the time that was set aside for saying goodbye to family members. I remember walking with a friend of mine, another Lieutenant I trained with as we walked away and his one and a half year old boy was toddling after him not understanding why his father wasn’t turning back to scoop him up. And it took all the strength he had, not to turn around and look at his boy one more time. That is happening by the thousands right now, as we see so many more troops sent into harm’s way. And my perspective is to ensure that that will never happen when there is an alternative as Commander in Chief. Senator Sanders. Wolf, in America today, our infrastructure is crumbling. Half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck. 87 million people have no healthcare or are under insured. You got 500,000 people sleeping out on the streets tonight. The American people are sick and tired of endless wars, which have cost us trillions of dollars. Our job is to rebuild the United Nations, rebuild the State department, make sure that we have the capability of bringing the world together to resolve international conflict diplomatically and stop the endless wars that we have experienced. We’re going to get to everyone, but Vice President Biden. You criticized President Trump’s decision to kill the Iranian General Soleimani, without first going to Congress. I ran the first time as a 29 year old kid against the war in Vietnam, on the grounds that only way they can take a nation to war, is with the informed consent of the American people. The informed consent of the American people. And with regard to this idea that we can walk away and not have any troops anywhere, excluding special forces, there’s no way you negotiate or been able to negotiate with terrorists. You have to be able to form coalitions, to be able to defeat them or contain them. If you don’t, we end up being the world’s policeman again. They’re going to come to us, they’ve come to us before, they’ll come to us again. So that’s a fundamental difference than negotiating with other countries, it’s fundamentally a requirement that we use our special forces in small numbers to coordinate with other countries to bring together coalitions. Mr Vice President, just to be clear, the Obama-Biden administration did not ask Congress for permission multiple times when it took military action. No, there was the authorization for the use of military force that was passed by the United States Congress House and Senate and signed by the President. That was the authority, does not give authority to go into Iran, it gave authority to deal with these other issues. Mayor Buttigieg. That authorization needs to be replaced. Exactly. We tried that. When we lost troops in [inaudible 00:19:21], there were members of Congress who admitted they didn’t even know we had troops there. And it was all pursuant to an authorization that was passed to deal with Al Qaeda and 9-11. And often Congress has been all too happy to leave aside its role. Now thanks to Democrats in Congress, that’s changing. But the reality is year after year, Congress didn’t want to touch this either because it was so politically difficult. Fundamental truth is, if our troops can summon the courage to go overseas into harm’s way, often on deployment after deployment, then we’ve got to make sure that Congress has the courage to take tough up or down votes on whether they ought to be there. And when I am President, anytime, which I hope will never happen, but anytime I’m compelled to use force, I seek that authorization. We will have a three year sunset, so that the American people are included not only in the decision about whether to send troops but whether to continue. Thank you. We’re going to get to everyone, but Senator Warren, what about you? Are there any circumstances other than a direct attack on the United States where you would take military action without congressional approval? E. Well imminent threat, but we need an authorization for the use of military force before we take this nation into combat. That is what the constitution provides and that’s what as Commander in Chief, I will do. But I just want to be clear, everyone on this stage talks about nobody wants endless war, but the question is when and how do you plan to get out of it? On Senate Armed Services Committee, we have one general after another in Afghanistan who comes in and says, “You know, we’ve just turned the corner and now it’s all going to be different.” E. And then what happens? It’s all the same for another year. Someone new comes in and we’ve just turned the corner. We’ve turned the corners so many times we’re going in circles in these regions. This has got to stop. It’s not enough to say, “Someday we’re going to get out.” No one on the ground. None of our military can describe what the conditions are for getting out. It’s time to get our combat troops home. Mr. I would take military action to protect the lives and safety of American citizens. But what we can see in the Middle East and what this conversation shows, is that there is no real strategy that we’re trying to accomplish in what we’re doing in the Middle East. Obviously Mr. Trump has no strategy. He is going from crisis to crisis from escalation to escalation. But if you look further over the last 20 years including in the war in Afghanistan, we know from the Washington Post that in fact there was no strategy, there was just a series of tactical decisions that made no sense. So we really have to ask ourselves in the Middle East, what are we trying to accomplish? I agree with Vice President Biden, to do it we should definitely be doing it in coalition with other countries. And I want to point out that as we do that we’re confronted by this issue which everyone is talking about. But at the same time there’s a gigantic climate issue in Australia, which also requires the same kind of value driven coalition building, that we actually should be using in the Middle East. We need to ask ourselves, how are we going to provide a world that is safer for Americans, where we can prosper more? And every single thing we do should follow into that strategy and it’s just not happening in Washington DC. Mayor Buttigieg, another critical issue you’d face as President is the threat of nuclear weapons. Last week, President Trump said, “As long as I am President of the United States, Iran will never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon. Ensuring that Iran does not develop nuclear weapons, will of course be a priority because it’s such an important part of keeping America safe. But unfortunately, President Trump has made it much harder for the next President to achieve that goal. By gutting the Iran nuclear deal, one that by the way, the Trump administration itself admitted was working, certified that it was preventing progress toward a nuclear Iran. By gutting that they have made the region more dangerous and set off the chain of events that we’re now dealing with as it escalates even closer to the brink of outright war. Continue. In order to get that done, we’ve got to work with our partners. The Iran nuclear deal, the technical term for it was the JCPOA, that first letter J stood for joint. We can’t do this alone. Even less so now after everything that has happened, which is why it will be so critically important to engage leaders, including a lot of new leaders emerging around the world and ensure that we have the alliances we need to meet what I believe is not just an American goal, but a widely shared goal around the world, to ensure that Iran does not become a nuclear armed country. No. Our security depends on ensuring that Iran does not become nuclear. And by the way, we’ve got a lot other challenges with nuclear proliferation around the world. Despite this President’s coziness with Vladimir Putin, we actually seem to be further away from being able to work with Russia on things like the renewal of START. We’ve got to move toward less, not more nuclear danger, whether it is from States, from stateless potential terrorist actors or anywhere else around the world. Thank you Mayor Buttigieg. Senator Klobuchar, if you become President, it’s very possible there won’t be an Iran nuclear deal for the United States to rejoin. I would start negotiations again and I won’t take that as a given, given that our European partners are still trying to hold the agreement together. My issue is that because of the actions of Donald Trump, we are in a situation where they are now starting, Iran is starting to enrich uranium again, in violation of the original agreement. So what I would do is negotiate, I would bring people together just as President Obama did years ago, and I think that we can get this done. But you have to have a President that sees this as a number one goal. And an answer to the original question you asked the mayor, I would not allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon. And then you have to get an agreement in place. I think there are changes you can make to the agreement, better sunsets and changes to the inspections, but overall that is what we should do. And I am the one person on this debate stage, on the first night of the very first debate, when we were asked what we saw as the biggest threat to our world, I said China on the economy, but I said Iran because of Donald Trump. Because I feared that exactly what happened would happen, enrichment of uranium, escalation of tensions, leaving frayed relations with our allies. We can bring them back, understanding this is a terrorist regime that we cannot allow to have a nuclear weapon. Vice President Biden, I want to ask you about North Korea. President Trump has met with Kim Jong-un three times. President Obama once said he would meet with North Korea without any preconditions. No, not now. I wouldn’t meet with him without any preconditions. Look, we gave him everything he’s looking for. Legitimacy, the President showed up, met with him, gave him legitimacy, weakened the sanctions we have against them. I would be putting what I did as Vice President. I’ve met with Xi Jinping more than anyone else. I would be putting pressure on China to put pressure on Korea, to cease and desist from their nuclear power, make their efforts to deal with nuclear weapons. I would move forward as we did before and you reported it extensively Wolf, about moving forward the whole notion of defense against nuclear weapons. And when China said to me, when Xi Jinping said to me, “That’s a threat to us.” I said, “We’re going to move and protect our interests unless you get involved and protect it.” I would re-ignite the relationship between Japan and South Korea and I would put enormous pressure on China because it’s also in their interest for them to put pressure on North Korea to cease and desist. But I would not meet with absent preconditions. I would not meet with the “Supreme leader” who said, “Joe Biden is a rabid dog. He should be beaten to death with a stick.” I count that. Other than that, you like him. Other than that I like him and he got a love letter from Trump right after that. Mr. No. It’s very clear that if we’re going to do something with North Korea, we’re going to have to do it in concert with our allies. That meeting with him without preconditions is not going anywhere, that the staff can meet to try and see how far we can get. But this is a classic situation where the United States idea of going it alone makes no sense. And when you are talking about Iran, let’s face it, Iran is under great pressure economically. So every single discussion we’ve had about Iran has had to do with military power and America versus Iran. Whereas in fact what worked with President Obama was an Alliance of our allies and us, putting economic pressure on them for them to give up their military tactic. Thank you Mr. Steyer. … Spending money. B. Let’s stay with the theme of America’s role in the world and talk about trade. Tomorrow, President Trump is expected to sign phase one of a trade agreement with China and the Senate will likely soon approve a new trade deal with Mexico and Canada, Iowa’s largest trading partners. Senator Sanders, you have said that new deal, the USMCA, ” Makes some modest improvements,” yet you’re going to vote against it. The answer is we could do much better than a Trump led trade deal. This deal, and I think the proponents of it acknowledge, will result in the continuation of the loss of hundreds of thousands of good paying jobs, as a result of outsourcing. The heart and soul of our disaster trade agreements and I’m the guy who voted against NAFTA and against permanent normal trade relations with China, is that we have forced American workers to compete against people in Mexico, in China, elsewhere, who earn starvation wages, a dollar or $2 an hour. Second of all, every major environmental organization has said no to this new trade agreement because it does not even have the phrase climate change in it. And given the fact that climate change is right now the greatest threat facing this planet, I will not vote for a trade agreement that does not incorporate very, very strong principles to significantly lower fossil fuel emissions in the world. B. But Senator Sanders, to be clear, the AFL-CIO supports this deal. The AFL-CIO does, the machinists union does not. And every environmental organization in this country, including the sunrise organization who are supporting my candidacy, opposes it. So I happen to believe, and I hope we will talk about climate change in a moment. If we do not get our act together in terms of climate change, the planet that we’re going to be leaving our kids and our grandchildren will be increasingly unlivable and uninhabitable. B. We’re going to get to climate change but I’d like to stay on trade. Senator Warren. Well they are the same in this issue. B. Senator Warren, you support the USMCA, why is Senator Sanders wrong? E. I do. I wasn’t here, I haven’t been in Congress long enough to have voted against NAFTA, but I led the fight against the trade deal with Asia and the trade deal with Europe because I didn’t think it was in the interest of the American people, the American workers or environmental interests. But we have farmers here in Iowa who are hurting and they are hurting because of Donald Trump’s initiated trade wars. We have workers who are hurting because the agreements that have already been cut, really don’t have enforcement on workers rights. E. This new trade deal is a modest improvement, Senator Sanders himself has said so. It will give some relief to our farmers, it will give some relief to our workers. I believe we accept that relief, we try to help the people who need help and we get up the next day and fight for a better trade deal. We need a coherent trade policy. We need a policy that actually helps our workers, our farmers. We need them at the table, not just a trade policy written for big international companies. I’m ready to have that fight but let’s help the people who need help right now. B. Thank you. Well, I think that it is not so easy to put together new trade legislation. If this is passed, I think it will set us back a number of years. Senator Warren is right, in saying we need to bring the stakeholders to the table, that is the family farmers here in Iowa and in Vermont and around the country. In Vermont and around the country, that is the environmental community. That is the workers. Bottom line here is I am sick and tired of trade agreements negotiated by the CEOs of large corporations. Senator Klobuchar, I’d like to bring you in here. Brianne, I want to hit reality here. I serve on the agriculture committee, and I will never forget going to Crawfordsville here in Iowa, and thank you for bringing up Iowa, Brianne, since that is where we are. I went to this plant, and there was one worker left in that plant. That plant had been shut down because of Donald Trump’s trade policies and because of what he had done to those workers, with giving secret waivers to oil companies and ruining the renewable fuel standard. That worker brought out a coat rack of uniforms, and he said, “These are my friends. They don’t work here anymore.” Their names were embroidered on those uniforms, Derek, Mark, Salvador, and that guy started to cry. These are real people hurt by Donald Trump’s trade war. So what we should do, and I support the USMCA. I am glad that these improvements were made that are supported by people like Richard Trumka and Sherrod Brown, on labor and environment, on pharma, the sweetheart deal, because I think we need a big trading block with North America to take on China. The way you are stronger than China is with your allies. Senator Klobuchar, your time is up. Yes, it has been improved. It is not perfect, but when you sit down with the people who are most impacted, they share just how much harm has been done to them by things like the trade war and just how much we can benefit, American consumers and workers and farmers, by making sure we have the right kind of labor and enforceability, as Democrats ensured we got in this USMCA. But let’s acknowledge why there is such fear and frustration. In my part of the country, in the industrial Midwest, I remember when they came around in the ’90s, selling trade deals, telling us, “Don’t worry about your slice of the pie. The pie will get so much bigger that everyone will be better off,” and that promise was broken. The part about the pie getting bigger happened. It’s just that the part about it getting to most people where I live did not. That is why there was such frustration. The sense that these decisions in board rooms and in committee rooms in Washington are being made not based on what’s best for us, but based on their own game. Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg. Vice President Biden, Senator Sanders has said Donald Trump will, quote, eat your lunch for voting yes on what he calls terrible trade agreements. There’ll be no trade agreements signed in my administration without environmentalist and labor at the table, and there will be no trade agreement until we invest more in American workers. We should be putting our money and our effort and our time in preparing America workers to compete in the 21st century on the high- tech side, dealing with artificial intelligence. We should be focusing on equipping American workers to do that. By the way, the idea … I don’t know that there’s any trade agreement that the senator would ever think made any sense, but the problem is that 95% of the customers are out there. So we’ve got to figure out how we begin to write the rules of the road, not China. Joe and I have a fundamental disagreement, in case you haven’t noticed, and that is NAFTA, PNTR with China, other trade agreements were written for one reason alone, and that is to increase the profits of large multinational corporations. The end result of those two, just PNTR with China, Joe, and NAFTA cost us some 4 million jobs as part of the race to the bottom. I am sick and tired and will not tolerate, and we will use the power of the federal contracting system. If a corporation in America wants to shut down in Iowa or Vermont or any place else and then they think they’re going to get online for a generous federal contract, they’ve got another thing going. We need some corporate responsibility here, and we need to protect good-paying jobs in America, not see them go to China, Mexico, Vietnam. Mr. We need corporate responsibility, and I agree with that completely. But we also need to have enforcement mechanisms in the agreements we made, enforceable agreements. That’s one of the things that has been improved with the trade agreement with Mexico, and that’s what we should be doing in any agreement we have. But let’s get back to the basics here. If we don’t set the rules of the road by going out to our partners, instead of poking our finger in the eye of all our friends and allies. We make up 25% of the world’s economy. We’ve got to bring the other 25% of our allies along with us to set the rules of the road so China cannot continue to abuse their power by stealing an actual are stealing our intellectual property and doing all the other things using their corporate state system to our significant disadvantage. Senator Warren? E. Our problem is not just that we need corporate responsibility. It’s been the structure of how these trade deals have been negotiated. The United States has had a strategy for decades, and that strategy has been to have government trade negotiators, a small number, and then surround them with giant multinational corporation lobbyists and corporate executives who whisper in the ears of our negotiators and then get deals cut that are great for the giant multinational corporations, not good for America, not good for American workers, not good for the environment. E. We need a different approach to trade, and it starts by calling out the corruption of these giant corporations that have cut our trade deals. Everybody wants to get to the American market, and we need to put some standards in place. You want to be able to sell your goods here, then you’ve got to meet some environmental standards. You’ve got to meet labor standards. Thank you, Senator Warren. E. We need a coherent approach. I’d like to bring in Mr. Steyer here. Mr Steyer, even though farmers and manufacturers here in Iowa and around the country could see some relief from the China deal, they’ve been crushed by the current administration’s trade war. Look. On the first day, I would undo Mr. Trump’s tariffs. On the first day, I would get rid of his waivers that Senator Klobuchar was referring to, to oil refiners not having to use corn-based ethanol. In fact, these trade deals have been exactly what Senator Sanders and Warren have been saying, which is that they’ve been designed to grow the American GDP for the corporations of America, not for the working people of America, and not to protect the climate. So let me say this. I’m the only person on this stage who says climate is my number one priority. I would not sign this deal, because if climate is your number one priority, you can’t sign a deal, even if it’s marginally better for working people, until climate is also taken into consideration. Look. I’ve got four kids between the ages of 26 and 31. I cannot allow this country to go down the path of climate destruction. Everybody in their generation knows it. Frankly, Mayor Buttigieg, you’re their generation. I’d think you would be standing up more. Look. That’s why I’m standing up for it. We cannot put climate on the backseat all the time and say, “We’re going to sign this one more deal. We’re going to do one more thing without putting climate first.” That’s why it’s my number one priority. We can do it in a way that makes us richer, but we have to do it. Well, that’s right. This issue’s personal for me. That’s why we’re going to tackle climate from day one. It’s why we’ve got to make sure that we have better answers than we do today. Now, what I’ve noticed is pretty much all of us propose that we move on from fossil fuels by the middle of the century, starting with actions that we take right now. The question is how are we going to make sure any of this actually gets done? Because people have been saying the right things in these debates for literally decades. The other day in Winterset, there was a kid at one of my events. Raised his hand, and he pointed out that he expects to be here in his nineties, in the year 2100. He will sit in judgment over what we do, not just what we on this stage do, anyone old enough to vote right now, whether we actually put together the national project it will require to meet our climate goals, to act aggressively, not just rejoining the Paris Climate Accord. That’s table stakes, but to actually move on from the fossil-dependent economy we live in today. Let’s now turn to an issue that’s come up in the last 48 hours, Senator Sanders. Seen and reported yesterday that … Senator Sanders, Senator Warren confirmed in a statement that in 2018, you told her that you did not believe that a woman could win the election. Well, as a matter of fact, I didn’t say it, and I don’t want to waste a whole lot of time on this, because this is what Donald Trump and maybe some of the media want. Anybody that knows me knows that it’s in comprehensible that I would think that a woman could not be President of the United States. Go to YouTube today. There’s a video of me 30 years ago, talking about how a woman could become President of the United States. In 2015, I deferred, in fact, to Senate Warren. There was a movement to draft Senator Warren to run for President, and you know what? I stayed back. Senator Warren decided not to run, and I did run afterwards. Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by three million votes. How could anybody in a million years not believe that a woman could become President of the United States? Let me be very clear. If any of the women on this stage or any of the men on this stage win the nomination … I hope that’s not the case. I hope it’s me. But if they do, I will do everything in my power to make sure that they are elected in order to defeat the most dangerous President in the history of our country. So Senator Sanders, Senator Sanders, I do want to be clear here. That is correct. Senator Warren, what did you think when Senator Sanders told you a woman could not win the election? E. I disagreed. Bernie is my friend, and I am not here to try to fight with Bernie. But look. This question about whether or not a woman can be President has been raised, and it’s time for us to attack it head-on. I think the best way to talk about who can win is by looking at people’s winning record. E. So can a woman beat Donald Trump? Look at the men on this stage. Collectively, they have lost ten elections. The only people on this stage who have won every single election that they’ve been in are the women. The only person on this stage who has beaten an incumbent Republican anytime in the past 30 years is me, and here’s what I know. The real danger that we face as Democrats is picking a candidate who can’t pull our party together or someone who takes for granted big parts of the Democratic constituency. E. We need a candidate who will excite all parts of the Democratic Party, bring everyone in, and give everyone a Democrat to believe in. That’s my plan, and that is why I’m going to win. Thank you, Elizabeth. Senator Klobuchar, let me finish my question. Oh, okay. I thought it was such an open end. I hear that. People have said it. That’s why I’ve addressed it from this stage. I point out that you don’t have to be the tallest person in the room. James Madison was five foot four. You don’t have to be the skinniest person in the room. You don’t have to be the loudest person. You have to be competent. When you look at the facts, Michigan has a woman governor right now, and she beat a Republican, Gretchen Whitmer. Kansas has a woman governor right now, and she beat Kris Kobach. Her name is … I’m very proud to know her, and her name is Governor Kelly. Thank you. Third, I would add to this you have to be competent to win, and you have to know what you’re doing. When you look at what I have done, I have won every race, every place, every time. I have one in the reddest of districts. I have won in the suburban areas, in the rural areas. I have brought people with me. Thank you. … because I know I bring people with me. Thank you, Senator Klobuchar. Finally, every single person that I have beaten, my Republican opponents, have gotten out of politics for good. I think that sounds pretty good. I think that sounds pretty good with the guy we have in the White House right now. Senator Sanders, you can respond. Well, just to set the record straight, I defeated an incumbent Republican running for Congress. E. 1990. That’s how I won. Beat a Republican Congressman. Number two, of course … E. 30 years ago. … I don’t think there’s any debate on … E. I beat an incumbent Republican Congressman. E. I said I was the only one who has beaten an incumbent Republican in 30 years. Well, 30 years ago is 1990, as a matter of fact. But I don’t know that that’s the major issue of the day. I think what the major issue of the day is … Does anybody in their right mind thing that a woman cannot be elected President? That’s enough. Nobody believes that. Hillary Clinton got 3 million votes, more votes than Trump. So who believes that a woman can’t win? Of course a woman can win. But the real question is how do we beat Trump? The only way we beat Trump is by a campaign of energy and excitement and a campaign that has, by far, the largest voter turnout in the history of this country. I believe that our campaign has the strongest grassroots movement. Thank you. We are endorsed by many grassroots organizations. Senator Warren? Senator Warren, I want to give you the final word. E. So I do think it’s the right question, how do we beat Trump? Here’s the thing. Since Donald Trump was elected, women candidates have outperformed men candidates in competitive races. In 2018, we took back the House. We took back state houses because of women candidates and women voters. E. Look. Don’t deny that the question is there. Back in the 1960s, people asked, “Could a Catholic win?” Back in 2008, people asked if an African American could win. Both times, the Democratic Party stepped up and said yes, got behind their candidate, and we changed America. That’s who we are. Vice President Biden? Vice president Biden, go ahead. I agree women can win, and I’ve went in and campaigned for 27 of them, this last in 2018 the best group I’ve ever campaigned for in terms of competence. But the real issue is who can bring the whole party together and represent all elements of the party, African Americans, brown, black, women, men, gay, straight? The fact of the matter is that I would argue that, in terms of endorsements around the country, endorsements wherever we go, I am the one who has the broadest coalition of anyone running up here in this race. All right, we’re going to take a short break now. The CNN Democratic Presidential Debate, live from Drake University, will be right back. Let’s turn to healthcare, the top issue for Iowa Democrats. Donald Trump is trying to repeal Obamacare, including the protections for preexisting conditions. We all know that each of you vigorously opposes that. Still, there are some questions about what each of you would do. Senator Sanders, you’ve consistently refused to say exactly how much your Medicare for All plan is going to cost. Well, what I will tell you is Medicare for All, which will guarantee comprehensive healthcare to every man, woman, and child, will cost substantially less than the status quo. Medicare for All will end the absurdity of the United States paying, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs and healthcare in general. While we have 87 million uninsured and underinsured and while 30,000 people die each year, on the Medicare for All, one of the provisions we have to pay for it is a 4% tax on income, exempting the first $29,000. So the average family in America that today makes $60,000 would pay $1,200 a year, compared to that family paying $12,000 a year. We save money, comprehensive healthcare, because we take on the greed and the profiteering and the administrative nightmare that currently exist in our dysfunctional system. I think we need to be candid with voters. I think we have to tell them what we’re going to do and what it’s going to cost, and a 4% tax on income over $24,000 doesn’t even come close to paying for between 30 and some estimates as high as $40 trillion over ten years. That’s doubling the entire federal budget per year. There’s a way to do that. The way to do that is to take Obamacare, re-instate, rebuild it, provide a public option, allow Medicare for those folks who want it, and, in fact, make sure that we, in the process, reduce the costs of drug prices, reduce the cost of being able to buy into the … subsidize it further, and make it available to everyone. Here’s the deal. That costs a lot of money that cost $740 billion over ten years. I lay out how I pay for that. Well, first of all, what Joe forgets to say is when you leave the current system as it is, what you are talking about, all workers paying, on average, 20% of their incomes for healthcare, that is insane. You’ve got 500,000 people going bankrupt because they cannot pay their medical bills. We’re spending twice as much per capita on healthcare as do the people of any other country. Look. We’ve talked about healthcare for all in this country for over 100 years. Now is the time to take on the greed and corruption of the healthcare industry, of the drug companies, and finally provide healthcare to all through a Medicare for All single payer program. It won’t be easy, but that is what we have to do. You can do it without Medicare for All. You can get the same place. Yeah. Senator Sanders and I have worked together on pharmaceuticals for a long, long time, and we agree on this. But what I don’t agree with is his position on healthcare. This debate isn’t real. I was in Vegas the other day, and someone said, “Don’t put your chips on a number on the wheel that isn’t even on the wheel.” That’s the problem. Over two thirds of the Democrats in the US Senate are not on the bill that you and Senator Warren are on. You have numerous governors that are Democratic that don’t support this. You have numerous House members that put Nancy Pelosi in a speaker. The answer is a nonprofit public option. The answer is the real debate we should be having is how do we make it easier for people to get coverage for addiction and mental health. I have a plan for that, and then, finally, what should we do about long-term care, the elephant that doesn’t even fit in this room? We need to make it easier for people to get long-term care insurance. We need to make it easier for them to pay for their premiums. My own dad, I know when his long-term care insurance ends, and then we have some savings for him. He’s in assisted living. He got married three times, whole nother story. So there isn’t much there. But then we go to Medicaid, and I’ve already talked to Catholic elder care. They’re willing to take him in. Our story is better than so many other families. We have to make it easier for long-term care. Thank you. Thank you, Senator Klobuchar. It’s not just for senators. Thank you, Senator Klobuchar. … people trying to help their parents. Senator Warren? E. So we need to start with what’s happening in America. People are suffering. I’ll just pick one. 36 million people last year went to the doctor, got a prescription. This is what they needed to get well, and they couldn’t afford to have the prescription filled. They looked at it and said, “It’s either groceries or this prescription.” E. My approach to this is we’ve got to get as much help to as many people as quickly as possible. I have worked out a plan where we can do that without raising taxes on middle class families by one thin dime. E. What I can do are the things that I can do as President on the first day. We can cut the cost of prescription drugs. I’ll use the power that’s already given to the President to reduce the cost of insulin and EpiPens and HIV/AIDS drugs. Let’s get some relief to those families, and I will defend the Affordable Care Act. E. I’ve got a plan to expand healthcare. But let’s keep in mind, when we come to a general election, we Democrats may argue among each other about the best way to do healthcare, but we’re going to be up against a Republican incumbent who has cut healthcare for millions of people and is still trying to do that. I’ll take our side of the argument any day. We’re going to beat him on this. Thank you. Thank you, Senator Warren. The [inaudible 01:00:41] my layout does, in fact, limit drug costs. It allows all the drug companies to … Excuse me, it allows Medicare to negotiate with drug companies for the price. It’s sets a system whereby you cannot raise the price of a drug beyond the cost of medical inflation. By the way, there’s mental health parity that I call for in the Obamacare expanded with the Biden option. Mr. Look. We’ve had this conversation on this stage so many times. Everybody on this stage believes that affordable healthcare is a right for every single American. Everybody on this stage knows that Americans are paying twice as much for healthcare as any other advanced country in the world. It makes no sense, and the government has to step in. I do happen to agree with vice President Biden that we should move and develop the Affordable Care Act with a public option, but the real question is this. This is not a new problem. Why do we keep having this conversation? We have a broken government. It has been bought by corporations that include the drug companies, the insurance companies, and the private hospitals. That’s what I’m talking about. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Steyer. Thank you, Mr. Steyer. Senator Sanders, your campaign proposals would double federal spending over the next decade, an unprecedented level of spending not seen since World War II. No, our plan wouldn’t bankrupt the country. In fact, it would much improve the wellbeing of working class families and the middle class. Let us be clear what Medicare for all does. It ends all premiums. It ends all copayments. It ends the absurdity of deductibles. It ends out-of-pocket expenses. It takes on the pharmaceutical industry, which, in some cases, charges us ten times more for the same prescription drugs sold abroad as sold here. What we will do through a Medicare for All single payer program is substantially lower the cost of healthcare for employers and workers, because we end the hundred billion dollars a year that the healthcare industry makes and the $500 billion a year we spend an the administrative nightmare of dealing with thousands of separate insurance plans. Healthcare is a human right. Every other major country on Earth is guaranteeing healthcare for all. The time is long overdue for us to do the same. Again, I think it is much better to build on the Affordable Care Act, and if you want to be practical and progressive at the same time and have a plan and not a pipe dream, you have to show how you’re going to pay for it. I would also note, practically, that the Affordable Care Act right now is ten points more popular than the President of the United States. So I think the answer is to build on it, and yes, I think you should show how you’re going to pay for things, Bernie. I do. This President is [inaudible 01:03:57] people out. They’re like poker chips in one of his bankrupt casinos. The way he is adding to our debt, I am the one person up here who has on her website, in her plan, a plan to actually start taking on the deficit by taking part of that money from that corporate tax cut that they put in there and putting it in a fund to pay back the deficit. Thank you. Thank you, Senator Klobuchar. Thank you, Senator Klobuchar. Let’s move on. … doing something about the hedge fund loophole. You can go through, and you can get the money to pay for things. Senator Klobuchar, your time is up. Let’s move on to the next question. Mayor Buttigieg, you’re selling your plan as Medicare for all who want it. Yet your plan would automatically enroll uninsured Americans into a public option, even if they don’t want it, and force them to pay for it. Well, it’s making sure that there is no such thing as an uninsured American. Look. The individual mandate was an important part of the ACA, because the system doesn’t work if there are free riders. What I’m offering is a choice. You don’t have to be in my plan if there’s another plan that you would rather keep, and there’s no need to kick Americans off the plans that they want in order to deliver healthcare for all. My plan is paid for. Look. Our party should no longer hesitate to talk about the issue of the debt and the deficit. We’ve got a dramatically better track record on it than Republicans do. In my lifetime, it’s almost invariably Republican Presidents who have added to the deficit. $1 trillion under this President. It’s why everything I’ve put forward, from Medicare for all who want it to the historic investments we’re going to make an infrastructure to dealing with climate change is fully paid for. What comes to healthcare, you can do it in two moves. Of course, my plan costs $1.5 trillion over a decade. No small sum, but not the 20, 30, 40 that we’re hearing about from the others. All I’ve got to do is two things. Both of them are common sense. Allow Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices, and roll back the Trump corporate tax cuts that went to corporations. Roll back the Trump corporate tax cuts that went to corporations and the wealthy that didn’t even need it. Senator Warren. E. So I started this by talking about 36 million Americans including Americans with insurance who just can’t even afford to have a prescription filled. We all talk about plans, healthcare plans that we have, and these plans are paid for. The problem is that plans like the mayor’s and like the vice president’s is that they are an improvement. They are an improvement over where we are right now. Not going to be enough to cover prescriptions for 36 million people who can’t afford to get them filled. What we need to do is make the commitment that we know where the money comes from. We can ask those at the very top, the top 1% to pay a little more. Those giant corporations like Chevron and Amazon who paid nothing in taxes. We can have them pay, and we can go after the corporate tax cheats. And when we do that, we have enough money to provide healthcare for all our people. E. Tax cheats. And when we do that, we have enough money to provide healthcare for all our people. Yes, we build on the Affordable Care Act, but where we end up is we offer healthcare to all of our people, and we can offer it at no cost or low cost to all of them. Mayor Buttigieg. It’s just not true that the plan I’m proposing is small. We’ve got to move past a Washington mentality that suggests that the bigness of plans only consists of how many trillions of dollars they put through the treasury, that the boldness of a plan only consists of how many Americans it can alienate. This would be a game changer. This would be the biggest thing we’ve done to American healthcare in a half century. Let’s measure the effects of our plans based on what they would do in our everyday lives and yes, we’re taking on costs on prescription drugs, we’ll have an out-of-pocket cap. Even if you don’t get the subsidies that would make it free, a $250 monthly cap and here’s why it’s got to be monthly. You ever been in that situation or known somebody who finds that they’ve got to defer a procedure or delay filling a prescription to try to have it happen in the right month because of when your out-of-pocket cap hits? It makes no sense medically because most of us don’t experience the economy on an annual basis. Our bills don’t come in every year. They come in every month. Same with our paychecks, biweekly or monthly. That’s why we set this up in a way to solve the problem without running up 20, 30 $40 trillion bills. Senator Warren, your response. E. Look, the numbers that the mayor’s offering just don’t add up. The average family in America last year paid $12,000 in some combination of deductibles and copays, and uncovered expenses and fees. You can’t cover that with the kind of money that the mayor is talking about. The way we have to approach this is we’ve got to build this and we’ve got to build the alliances to make this happen. I can bring down the cost of prescription drugs like insulin and take hundreds of millions of dollars out of the system immediately in costs. We can get help to families, but we have to be willing to work together. E. We can let people experience what healthcare is like when it’s you and your doctor, your mental health professional, your nurse practitioner with no insurance companies standing in the middle. [crosstalk 01:09:12] When people try it and use it, then. Thank you, Senator Warren. Senator Warren, you acknowledged that Medicare for all, that you couldn’t get there right away. You got on the bill that said on page eight, which is why I didn’t get on it, that you would kick 149 million Americans off their current health insurance. Then a few months ago, you said, “No, you’re going to wait a while to get there.” And I think that was some acknowledgement that maybe what we’re talking about is true. And I don’t buy that it’s not enough. It is a big, big step to say to people making $100,000 a year that, “Your premiums will be cut in half.” Which is what the nonprofit public option will do. And if you talk, mayor Buttigieg, about Medicare and having negotiation, I actually have led that bill for years. I have 34 co-sponsors. As president, I can get it done. That would allow Medicare to finally negotiate and lift the ban that big pharma got into law that says they can’t negotiate for better prices for our seniors. I will it done. Senator Sanders, coming to you now. CNN reached out to Iowa Democratic voters for their most pressing questions. Edward from here in Des Moines writes, “Des Moines is an insurance town. We build into our Medicare for all program a transition fund of many, many billions of dollars that will provide for up to five years income and healthcare and job training for those people. But here is the issue, Tom Steyer made the point a moment ago. We are now spending twice as much per person on healthcare as do the people of any other country. That is insane. In some cases, 10 times more for prescription drugs. Why is that? Why is that? And the answer is the greed and corruption of the drug companies and the insurance companies. And end hundreds of billions of dollars of waste and profiteering. Mr. Steyer. I just want to emphasize what Senator Sanders said. This is not a complicated problem. Between what Senator Warren and Senator Sanders said, it’s clear. There are two problems. We’re spending way too much because corporations own the system, and we’re not negotiating against those corporations and we’ve given tax cuts to the richest Americans and the biggest corporations for decades. That’s all this is. We have corporations who are having their way with the American people and people are suffering. Senator Warren is right. This is cruelty for money. In order to break this, we’re going to have to break the corporate stranglehold and solve both the tax and the negotiating problem. That’s why I’m for term limits. We need to redo Washington DC [crosstalk 01:12:27] and actually take back the government from the corporations who bought it. Thank you, Mr. Steyer. I would argue that the biggest breakthrough in recent time was us being able to do in our administration what five Democratic presidents couldn’t get done, and that is pass Obamacare. It was a big deal. Secondly, I would argue that the way you control drug prices is you limit what they can charge for those prices, you don’t have to pay the price. Limit what they can charge. If in fact they charge more than we set the price for, in fact, people can import from abroad assuming that it is safe. We in fact… It’s only yellow. Okay? And we can in fact do all of this and still provide people the option to stay the roughly 150 to 160 million Americans who like the negotiated plan they have with their employers, if they don’t like it or the employer gets rid of it, they can buy into a Medicare plan in the Biden plan. Let’s talk a little bit more about prescription drugs right now. Prescription drug prices in 2018, Americans spent $335 billion on prescription drugs alone. That’s about $60 billion more than they paid a decade ago. Senator Warren, you’ve called for the creation of a government-run drug manufacturer that would step in if there is a drug shortage or a price spike. Why does it make sense for the government to manufacture drugs, especially when public trust in government is near historic lows? E. So, let’s do this both ways. What I also have said is I’m just going to use the power that is available, and I will do what a president can do all by herself on the very first day, and that is lower the prices of certain prescription drugs. I will lower the price of insulin. We already have the legal authority with the president to do that. President just hasn’t picked up and used it. I will lower the price of EpiPens, of HIV/AIDS drugs. That’s going to bring a lot of relief to a lot of families immediately, but you know there are a whole lot of drugs, about 90% of drugs that are not under patent. They’re generic drugs, but the drug industry has figured out how to manipulate this industry to keep jerking the prices up and up and up. So my view is let’s give them a little competition. E. The government lets contracts for all kinds of things. They let contracts to build buildings, they let contracts to build military weapons. Let’s let the contracts out, put the contracts out so that we can put more generic drugs out there and drive down those prices. This is a way to make markets work, not to try to move away from the market. You don’t have to even use price controls. The whole idea behind it is get some competition out there so the price of these drugs that are no longer under patent drops where it should be. I am open to looking at it, but I would try these things first. Number one, I mentioned the Medicare negotiation. Number two, I have a plan, 137 things I’ve found that a president can do herself in the first 100 days without Congress that are legal, and one of those things is that you can start bringing in less expensive drugs from other countries. Bernie and I had an amendment on this. We got 14 Republican votes on it. It was at midnight. They might’ve not known what they were voting for, but we got that. I now have an actual bill with Senator Grassley that does that, and I have a bill to get at what Elizabeth was talking about, which is to stop generics from taking money from big pharmaceuticals to keep their products off the market. The issue here is that there are two pharma lobbyists for every member of Congress. Thank you, Senator. They think they own Washington. They don’t own me. And as president, I will get this done. Thank you, Senator Klobuchar. We’re going to turn now to childcare, a huge expense for many new families and a problem that’s especially acute in rural Iowa. We have another question from an Iowa Democratic voter. Mayor, Buttigieg, this is for you. Tiffany from Clive writes, “As a young mom, I had to quit a job I love because childcare costs were taking up two thirds of my income. Many families don’t have the option of quitting a job because that little bit of income is needed. That leads to families using whatever care they can find, and sometimes the results are deadly as we’ve seen in Iowa over the last few years. It makes no sense for childcare to cost two thirds of somebody’s income. We’ve got to drive it to 7% or below, and zero for those families who are living in poverty. But this is happening to folks at every level of the income spectrum. I meet professionals who sometimes say that they’re working in order to be able to afford childcare in order to be able to be working. It makes no sense and it must change and we shouldn’t be afraid to put federal dollars into making that a reality. Subsidizing childcare and making sure that we are building up a workforce of people who are paid at a decent level to offer early childhood education as well as childcare at large. We can do that and until we do this will be one of the biggest drivers of the gender pay gap because when somebody’s like the the voter asking the question has to step out of the workforce because of that reason, she is at a disadvantage when she comes back in, and that can affect her pay for the rest of her career. Senator Warren, your education plan includes tuition-free public college for all, but you impose an income limit for free childcare. Why do your plans cover everyone for public college, but not childcare and early learning? E. No, actually my plan is universal childcare for everyone. It just has some people adding a small payment, but understand this about the plan. I’ve been there. You know, I remember when I was a young mom, I had two little kids and I had my first real university teaching job. It was hard work. I was excited, but it was childcare that nearly brought me down. We went through one childcare after another and it just didn’t work. E. If I hadn’t been saved by my Aunt Bee, I was ready to quit my job. And I think about how many women of my generation just got knocked off the track and never got back on. How many of my daughter’s generation get knocked off the track and don’t get back on. How many mamas and daddies today are getting knocked off the track and never get back on. E. I have a two-cent wealth tax so that we can cover childcare for all of our children and provide universal pre-K for every three-year-old and four-year-old in America, and stop exploiting the people who do this valuable work, largely black and brown women. We can raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in America. That’s an investment in our babies. That’s an investment in their mamas and their daddies and it’s an investment in our teachers and in our economy. Senator Sanders, will your universal- E. It’s what we need to do. Yeah. Let me just pick up on this childcare thing. Every psychologist in the world knows zero through four are the most important years of human life, intellectually and emotionally, and yet our current childcare system is an embarrassment. It is unaffordable. Childcare workers are making wages lower than McDonald’s workers. We need to fundamentally change priorities in America. We should not be one of the few countries that does not have universal, high quality, affordable childcare. We should not be one of the only major countries not to guarantee healthcare to all people as a human right. We should not be spending more than the 10 next countries on the military, hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies for the fossil fuel industry. Tax breaks for billionaires, and then to tell the moms and dads in this country, “We cannot have [crosstalk 01:20:36] high-quality, affordable childcare.” That is wrong. Vice President Biden, infant care is more expensive than in-state public college tuition in more than half the country. There should be free, universal infant care, but here’s the deal. I was a single parent too when my wife and daughter were killed. My two boys I had to raise. I was a young Senator. I just hadn’t been sworn in yet, and I was making $42,000 a year. I commuted every single solitary day to Wilmington, Delaware over 500 miles a day. Excuse me, 250 miles a day because I could not afford, but for my family, childcare. It was beyond my reach to be able to do it and that’s why there’s several things we do. When I tripled the amount of money for title one schools, every child three, four and five-years-old will in fact have full schooling. They’ll go to school and after school programs, which will release some of the burden. Secondly, I think we should have an $8,000 tax credit, which would put 7 million women back to work. They could afford to go to work and still care for their children as an $8,000 tax credit. I also believe that we should, in fact, for people who in fact are not able to afford any of the infant care to be able to get that care. But Bernie’s right. We have to raise the salaries of the people who are doing the care, and I provide for that as well. My time is up. I know, but I’m not going to go over like everybody. Mayor Buttigieg, higher education is another huge expense for families. You oppose free public college for all because you don’t want to make it “free for the kids of millionaires”. But lots of public services are available to the kids of rich people like libraries and public schools. Well, it’s simple. We expect and hope for everyone to get through 12th grade. It’s not the same for college. Now again, I don’t want cost ever to be a barrier to somebody seeking to attend college, and under my plan it won’t be. Matter of fact, for the first 80% of Americans by income, it is free at public colleges, but if you’re in that top income bracket, don’t get me wrong, I still wish you well. I hope you succeed when you go to college. I just need you to go ahead and pay that tuition because we could be using those dollars for something else. There is a very real choice about what we do with every single taxpayer dollar that we raise. And we need to be using that to support everybody, whether you go to college or not, making sure that Americans can thrive, investing in infrastructure and something that hasn’t come up very much tonight, but deserves a lot of attention. Poverty, you know, the Poor People’s Campaign is marching on Iowa right now, calling on us to talk about this issue more. They are driven by their faith. I think, because even though in politics we’re supposed to talk middle-class, they know there’s no scripture that says, “As you’ve done under the middle-class, so you’ve done unto me. We got to be making sure that we target our tax dollars, where they will make the biggest difference. And I don’t think subsidizing the children of millionaires and billionaires to pay absolutely zero in tuition of public colleges is the best use of those scarce [crosstalk 01:23:52] taxpayer dollars. Senator Warren. E. So look, the way I think we need to do this is we need a wealth tax in America. We need to ask people with fortunes above $50 million to pay more, and that means that the lowliest millionaire that I would tax under this wealth tax would be paying about $19 million in the first year in taxes. If he wants to send his kid to public university, then I’m okay with that because what we really need to talk about is the bigger economic picture here. We need to be willing to put a wealth tax in place to ask those giant corporations that are not paying to pay because that’s how we build an economy and for those who want to talk about it, bring down the national debt. You do universal child care, and you got a lot of mamas who can go to work. A lot of mamas who can finish their education. We make that investment in universal college. We’ve got [crosstalk 01:24:44] people who would finish an education. Thank you, Senator. Senator Klobuchar. Yeah. You know, I [crosstalk 01:24:47] appreciate your thoughts, Elizabeth, but I want to step back. I actually think that some of our colleagues who want free college for all aren’t actually thinking big enough. I think what we have to look at is how we connect our education system with our economy. Where are our job openings, and what do we need? We are going to have over a million openings for home healthcare workers that we don’t know how to fill in the next 10 years. We are going to have open 100,000 jobs for nursing assistants. We, as my union friends know, we’re going to have over 70,000 openings for electricians. We’re not going to have a shortage of MBAs. We’re going to have a shortage of plumbers. So, when we look at that, then we step back. Where should our money go? It should go into K-12 it should go into free one and two-year degrees like my dad got like my sister got. [crosstalk 01:25:37] And then we double the Pell grants because we’re going to need four-year degrees so the money goes where it should go instead of two rich kids going to college. Mr. No. And let me say this, I was one of the people who talked about a wealth tax, almost a year-and-a-half ago. I believe that the income inequality in this country is unbearable, unjust and unsupportable, and the redistribution of wealth to the richest Americans from everyone else has to end. And I proposed a wealth tax almost a year-and-a-half ago to start to address it and to raise some of the money that we need. But I want to go beyond this and go back to this question about education because we’re talking a lot about college. But in fact, if you talk about the Poor People’s Campaign, you have to realize that for the youngest kids, they are getting an education that’s relative to the taxes in their neighborhoods. We need to redistribute money so every kid has a chance. So we’re not legislating inequality for the next generation. And so, we actually invest in every single kid, specifically poor kids, specifically black kids, specifically brown kids. We need to start using the money dramatically more for that. We’ll be back with more from CNN’s Democratic Presidential Debate live from Des Moines, Iowa. … Senate, launching the third trial of a US president. It’s irrelevant. There’s no choice but for Nancy Pelosi and the House to move. He has in fact committed impeachable offenses. Whether the Senate makes that judgment or not is for them to decide, and by the way, I’m told that I say we have to unite the country. It’s going to be harder after this trial. It may be, but look, you know, I understand how these guys are, this Republican party. They’ve gone after, Savage, my surviving son. Gone after me, told lies that your networks and others won’t even carry on television because they’re flat out lies, and I did my job. The question is whether or not he did his job. And he hasn’t done his job, and so it doesn’t really matter whether or not he’s going after me, I’ve got to be in a position that I think of the American people. I can’t hold a grudge. I have to be able to not only fight, but also heal, and as president of the United States, that’s what I will attempt to do, not withstanding that we’re going to be more division after he’s defeated by me this next time. Senator Klobuchar, going to be a juror in the trial in the Senate that’s about to start. No. We have a constitutional duty to perform here. And when I look at what the issue is, it’s whether or not we’re going to be able to have witnesses. We’ve asked for only four people as witnesses, and if our Republican colleagues won’t allow those witnesses, they may as well give the president a crown and a scepter. They may as well make him king. And last time I checked, our country was founded on this idea that we didn’t want to be ruled by a king. And I think the best way to think about this trial and what we’re facing in this election is a story of a man from Primghar, Iowa. His name was Joseph Welch. He came from humble beginnings, a son of immigrants. He became the army counsel, and he was the one that went to the Joseph McCarthy hearings. And when McCarthy was blacklisting people and going after people because of their political beliefs or supposed political beliefs, there was only one man. Everyone that was afraid, they’re afraid of being blacklisted. This is a decency check on our government. This is a patriotism check. Thank you. But also this election, and no matter if you agree with everyone here on the stage, I say this to [crosstalk 01:34:52] Americans, you know this is a decency check on this president. Mr. Steyer, you’ve spent millions and millions of dollars telling the American people that President Trump deserves to be impeached. Well Wolf, actually what I’ve done is to organize a petition drive of eight-and-a-half million Americans to sign and say this president deserves to be impeached and removed from office. And those eight-and-a-half million people have called their Congress people, have emailed their Congress people and have actually dragged Washington DC to see that in fact, this is a question of right and wrong and not of political expediency. So, if you ask me whether standing up for what’s right in America, standing up for the American people and our safety, standing up for the constitution, whether doing that and trying to bring the truth in front of the American people in televised hearings so we can decide what the truth is for ourselves, if you think that that isn’t worth it, then you don’t share the idea that I do about what America’s about. Standing up for what’s right is always worth it, Wolf, and I will never back down from that. Senator Warren, a Senate trial is expected to keep you in Washington in the weeks leading up to the Iowa caucuses here. How big of a problem is that for you as you’re making your closing pitch to voters here? E. Look, some things are more important than politics. I took an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States of America. It says that no one is above the law that includes the president of the United States. If we have an impeachment trial, I will be there because it is my responsibility. But understand this, what that impeachment trial is going to show once again to the American people, and something we should all be talking about, is the corruption of this administration. That’s what lies at the heart of it. It is about Donald Trump putting Donald Trump first, not the American people, not the interests of the United States of America, not even in helping Ukraine defend against Russia. It is about him helping himself. That is what we need to do to win this election. We need to draw that distinction and show that as Democrats, we’re not going to be the people who are just out for the big corporations, people who want to help themselves, that we are going to be the party that is willing to fight on the side of the people. That’s why we’re here. Let’s turn now to the climate crisis. Here in Iowa, parts of the state remain underwater after record-breaking flooding began last spring, racking up an estimated $2 billion in damages. Today, many Iowans are still displaced from their homes. That’s why we have to fight climate change with such urgency. Climate change has come to America from coast to coast. We’re seeing it in Iowa. We’ve seen it in historic floods in my community. I had to activate our emergency operation center for a once in a [inaudible 01:38:04] flood. Then two years later, had to do the same thing. In Australia there are literally tornadoes made of fire taking place. This is no longer theoretical. This is no longer off in the future. We have got to act, yes to adapt, to make sure our communities are more resilient, to make sure our economy is ready for the consequences that are going to happen one way or the other. But we also have to ensure that we don’t allow this to get any worse. And if we get it right, farmers will be a huge part of the solution. We need to reach out to the very people who have sometimes been made to feel that accepting climate science would be a defeat for them. In the national project to do something about this. So, clarify. …. Funds to make sure that we are supporting those whose lives will inevitably be impacted further by the increased severity and the increased frequency. And by the way, that is happening to farms, that is happening to factories and that disproportionally happens to black and brown Americans, which is why equity and environmental justice have to be at the core of our climate plan going forward. Brianne P. Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg. Look, what you’re talking about is what’s called managed retreat. It’s basically saying, we’re going to have to move things because this crisis is out of control and it’s unbelievably expensive. And of course, we’re going to come to the rescue of Americans who are in trouble. But this is why climate is my number one priority. And I’m still shocked that I’m the only person on this stage who will say this. I would declare a state of emergency on day one on climate. I would do it from the standpoint of environmental justice and make sure we go to the black and brown communities where you can’t breathe the air or drink the water that comes out of the tap safely. But I also know this, we’re going to create millions of good paying union jobs across this country. It’s going to be the biggest job program in American history. So I know we have to do it, I know we can do it and I know that we can to do it in a way that makes us healthier, that makes us better paid and is more just. But the truth of the matter is, we’re going to have to do it and we’re going to have to make the whole world come along with us and it’s going to have to be priority one. Brianne P. Mr. Steyer, to clarify, you say you’re the climate change candidate, but you made your $1.6 billion in part by investing in coal, oil, and gas. I absolutely am. Look, we invested in every part of the economy and over 10 years ago I realized that there was something going on that had to do with fossil fuels, that we had to change. So I divested from fossil fuels. I took the giving pledge to give most of my money away while I’m alive. And for 12 years, I’ve been fighting the climate crisis. I’ve beat oil companies in terms of clean air laws. I’ve stopped fossil fuel plants in Oxnard, California. I fought the Keystone Pipeline. I have a history of over a decade of leading the climate fight successfully- Brianne P. Thank you Mr. Steyer. So actually, yes, I am the person here who has the chops and the history that says I’ll make it priority one because I’ve been doing it for a long time. Brianne P. Thank you. Mr Steyer. Senator Warren, President Trump is rolling back major environmental rules to allow pipelines and other major infrastructure projects to be built without strict environmental review. Will you restore those protections and in a way that the next president can’t overturn? E. Yes. Climate change threatens every living thing on this planet and the urgency of the moment cannot be overstated. I will do everything a president can do all by herself on the first day. I will roll back the environmental changes that Donald Trump is putting in place. I will stop all new drilling and mining on federal lands and offshore drilling. That’ll help us get in the right directions. I’ll bring in the farmers. Farmers can be part of the climate solution. We should see this though for the problem it is. Mr. Steyer talks about it being problem number one. Understand this, we have known about this climate crisis for decades. Back in the 1990s, we were calling it global warming, but we knew what it was. Democrats and Republicans back then were working together because no one wanted a problem. E. But you know what happened? The industry came in and said, we can make big money if we keep them divided and make no change. Priority number one has to be taking back our government from the corruption. That is the only way we will make progress on climate, on gun safety, on healthcare, on all of the issues- Brianne P. Thank Senator Warren. E. That matter to us. Brianne P. Well, first of all, I would note that I have a 100% rating from the League of Conservation Voters and that is because I have stood tall on every issue that we have talked about up here, when it comes to this administration, this Trump administration, trying to reverse environmental protections. I think it is going to lead to so many problems and one thing that hasn’t been raised by the way is the rules on methane, which is actually one of the most environmentally dangerous hazards that they have recently embarked on. And I would bring those rules back as well as a number of other ones. When it comes to the issue of fracking, I actually see natural gas as a transition fuel. It’s a transition fuel to where we get to carbon neutral. Nearly every one of us has a plan that is very similar and that is to get to carbon neutral by 2045 to 2050. To get to by 2030 do a 45% reduction. And I want to add one thing that no one’s really answered. When we do this, we have to make sure that we make people whole and when we put a tax on carbon, which we will do, either through CAP and trade or through a renewable electricity standard or through a fee on carbon. Brianne P. Then we have to make sure the money goes back to the people that will be hurt by it. [crosstalk 01:44:17] To help with their energy bills and to bring jobs to areas that will lose jobs. Brianne P. Senator Sanders. Thank you. Let’s be clear, if we as a nation do not transform our energy system away from fossil fuel, not by 2050, not by 2040, but unless we lead the world right now, not easy stuff, the planet we are leaving our kids will be uninhabitable and unhealthy. We are seeing Australia burning. We saw California burning. The drought here in Iowa is going to make it harder for farmers to produce the food that we need. This is of course a national crisis. I’ve introduced legislation to indicate it’s an actual crisis. We have got to take on the fossil fuel industry and all of their lies and tell them that their short term profits are not more important than the future of this planet. That’s what the Green New Deal does. That’s what my legislation does and that is what we have to do. Brianne P. Vice President Biden, your response. My response is back in 1986, I introduced the first climate change bill and check Politifacts, they said it was a game changer. I’ve been fighting this for a long time. I headed up the Recovery Act, which put more money into moving away from fossil fuels to solar and wind energy than ever has occurred in the history of America. Look, what we have to do is we have to act right away and the way we act right away is immediately. If I’m elected president, I’ll reinstate all the mileage standards that existed in our administration, which were taken down, that’s 12 billion gallons of gasoline, barrels of gasoline to be saved immediately. And with regard to those folks who in fact are going to be victimized by what’s already happened. We should be investing in infrastructure that raises roads, makes sure that we’re in a position where we have … every new highway build is a green highway. [inaudible 01:46:18] 550,000 charging stations. We can create, and this is where I agree with Tom, we can create millions of good paying jobs. We’re the only country in the world that’s ever take great crisis and turn it into a great opportunity. And one of the ways to do it is with farmers here in Iowa, by making them the first group in the world to get to net-zero emissions by paying them for planting and absorbing carbon in their fields right away. A key part of your mission in this primary is going to be to prove to democratic voters that you’re strong enough to take on Donald Trump. Each of you face unique challenges in doing that. Mayor Buttigieg, you say you’ve had trouble earning the support of black voters because you’re unknown but you’ve been campaigning for a year now and polling shows you with next to no black support. Support that you’ll need in order to beat Donald Trump. The black voters who know me best are supporting me. That’s why I have the most support in South Bend. It’s why among elected black officials in my community, who have gotten into this race, by far most of them are supporting me. And now nationally, I am proud that my campaign has co-chaired by a member of the Congressional Black Caucus and to have support right here in Iowa from some of the most recognizable black elected leaders. From Mayor Hart of Waterloo to former Representative Berry in Black Hawk County. Now, the biggest mistake we could make is to take black votes for granted and I never will. The reason I have the support I do is not because any voter thinks that I’m perfect. It’s because of the work that we have done facing some of the toughest issues that communities can. Not from the luxury of a of a debate or a television panel or a committee room, but on the ground. Issues from poverty to justice in policing. And I’m proud to say we’ve been nationally recognized for our work as a race informed city on delivering greater economic justice. That we have reduced use of force by leading the region in transparency around the use of force in policing. Of course, there is a much longer way to go, in my community and around the country. But I will be a president whose personal commitment is to continue doing this work. Senator Sanders, you call yourself a democratic socialist, but more than two thirds of voters say they are not enthusiastic about voting for a socialist. Nope, not at all. And that is because the campaign that we are going to run will expose the fraudulency of who Donald Trump is. Donald Trump is corrupt. He is a pathological liar and he is a fraud. Now when Trump talks about socialism, what he talks about is giving hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks and subsidies to the fossil fuel industry. Donald Trump as a businessman, received $800 million in tax breaks and subsidies to build luxury housing. My democratic socialism says healthcare is a human right. We’re going to raise the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour. We’re going to make public colleges and universities tuition free. We’re going to have a Green New Deal and create up to $20 million, saving the planet for our children and our grandchildren. We are going to take on the greed and corruption of the pharmaceutical industry and the insurance company. That is what democratic socialism is about and that will win this election. Mr. Steyer, you’ve spent more than $100 million of your own dollars on television ads. Look, we know how Donald Trump is going to run for president. He’s going to run on the economy. He’s already told Americans last month in Florida, you don’t like me and I don’t like you, but you’re all going to vote for me because the Democrats are going to destroy the economy in 15 minutes if they get in control. So let’s be clear, I started a business by myself in one room. I didn’t inherit a penny from my parents. I spent 30 years building that business into a multi-billion dollar international business. Then I walked away from it and took the giving pledge and started organizing coalitions of ordinary Americans to take on unchecked corporate power. But whoever is going to beat Mr. Trump is going to have to beat him on the economy and I have the experience and the expertise to show that he’s a [inaudible 01:50:58] and a fraud. Look, Mayor Pete has three years as an analyst at McKinsey. I have 30 years of international business experience, I can beat Trump on the economy. We’re going to have to beat him on the economy and I look forward to taking him down in the fall on the debate stage. Mayor Buttigieg. You demoted me, I was actually an associate but that’s okay. It was not the biggest part of my career, but I am ready to take on this president on the economy because I am from the exact kind of industrial Midwestern community that he pretends to speak to and has proven to turn his back on and guided that community through a historic transformation. When at the beginning of the decade I took office, we were described as a dying city. I’m ready to take on Donald Trump because when he gets to the tough talk and the chest thumping, he’ll have to stand next to an American war veteran and explain how he pretended bone spurs made him ineligible to serve. And if and if he keeps trying to use religion … If a guy like Donald Trump keeps trying to use religion to somehow recruit Christianity into the G.O.P., I will be standing there not afraid to talk about a different way to answer the call of faith and insist that God does not belong to a political party. I am ready to take on this president on every front. Thank you. Senator Klobuchar, you’re pitching yourself as a practical candidate who can get things done. And even tonight you’ve dismissed some of the ideas that are offered in this primary as pipe dreams. Our voters, actually all Americans have seen now a number of years of a guy that has, I think, told over 15,000 lies. He is someone that literally has a rap sheet of divisive rhetoric. And I think what Americans want is something different. I am going to be able to stand across from him on that debate stage and say to my friends in Iowa, the Midwest is not flyover country for me, I live here. I’m going to be able to look at him and say, you’ve treated these workers and farmers like poker chips. For me, these are my friends and these are my neighbors. I’m going to be able to look at him and say, you know what? You got $413 million over the course of your career, that’s how you built your fortune. And what I’m going to say is this, my grandpa worked 1500 feet underground in the iron ore mines, saved money in a coffee can in the basement to send my dad to a two year community college. That’s my family trust. And when you have been given an opportunity like that, you go into the world, not with the sense of entitlement, Donald Trump, but with a sense of obligation. Thank you. Senator Warren, what do you say to voters who like your policies but they’re worried they will scare away swing voters you need to win this race in November? E. So I was born and raised in Oklahoma. I have three older brothers who are all retired, who are all back there still. And two of my three brothers are Republicans. And sure, there are a lot of things we disagree on and we can take to our corners and do the Democratic, Republican talking points. But the truth is there’s a whole lot we agree on. You know, my brothers just furious over Chevron and Eli Lilly and Amazon, that are giant corporations make billions of dollars in taxes … make billions of dollars in profits and pay nothing in taxes. My brother said, “I don’t get this. I have to pay my taxes. Somebody has to keep the roads paved and the schools open and pay for our defense.” E. They understand that we have an America right now that’s working great for those at the top. It’s just not working for anyone else. We have a chance to unite, unite as Democrats, but also with independents and Republicans, who are sick of living in a country that’s working great for the politicians that are taking the money. It’s working great for the lobbyists. It’s working great for the corporate executives. It’s just not working for everyone else. I’m building the grassroots movement, leading the fight. We’re going to make this America work for everyone else. That is how we’re going to beat Donald Trump. Vice President Biden, the eventual nominee will face President Trump, who has no problem mocking people using insulting nicknames, slinging mud, and telling lies. The debate against him will make tonight’s debate look like child’s play. I am prepared for that. Look, I’ve been the object of his affection now more than anybody else on this stage. I’ve taken all the hits he can deliver and I’m getting better in the polls, my going up. And by the way, I have overwhelming support from the African American community, overwhelming more than everybody else in this operation, number one. Number two, working class people, where I come from in Pennsylvania and the places I come from in Delaware, I have great support. I have support across the board and I’m not worried about taking on Donald Trump at all. And with regard to the economy, I can hardly wait to have that debate with him. Where I come from, the neighborhoods I come from, they’re in real trouble, working class people and middle class people. When the middle class does well, working class has a way up and the wealthy do well. But what’s happening now? They’re being clobbered, they’re being killed. They now have a situation where if they … the vast majority believe their children will never reach the stage that they’ve reached an economic security. I love that debate because the American public is getting clobbered. The wealthy are the only ones doing well, period. I’m looking forward to the economic debate. We’ll be right back with more from CNN’s Democratic presidential debate, live from Des Moines, Iowa. Stay right here. …. Iowa. Time now for closing statements, you each have one minute. Senator Klobuchar, let’s begin with you. Donald Trump thinks this is all about him. I think it’s about you. It’s not about his resorts or his tweets or even his ego. It is about your healthcare. It is about your schools. It is about your lives and your future. So if you want to do something about racial justice and immigration reform and climate change and gun safety, we need a candidate who is actually going to bring people with her. I have won every race, every place, every time. I have gotten the highest voter turnout in the country when I’ve led the ticket. I have passed more bills as the lead Democrat than anyone who’s in Congress that’s running for president. I believe that we need a president that’s going to look out for you. It is easy to hurl insults. It is easy to draw lines in the sand and sketch out grand ideological sketches that will never see the light of day. What is hard is bringing people together and finding common ground instead of scorched earth. What is hard is the work of governing. So if you are tired of the extremes in our politics and the noise and the nonsense, you have a home with me. Join me at amyklobuchar.com. Mr. Steyer. I know that Iowans are going to caucus within three weeks and I want to tell you how I feel about the American people. Look, I played team sports my entire life. The bond between teammates is deep and emotional and full of love and as far as I’m concerned, the American people are my teammates. And if there’s one thing I will not permit, it is someone to run down the field and kick my teammate in the face. And that is exactly what I’ve seen over the last seven years traveling around this country, seeing these Republicans led by Mr. Trump, basically kicking the American people in the face. I am prepared to take on Mr. Trump on the debate stage and take him down on the economy. But I am asking for your support because I know that if I’m going to be a good teammate to you and give you absolutely everything without any compromise, I need the support of you on caucus night so I can turn around and together we can take back this country and together we can save the world. Mayor Buttigieg. This is our moment. This is our one shot to defeat Donald Trump and to do it by such a big margin that we send Trumpism into the dustbin of history too. Well, we cannot take the risk with so much on the line of trying to confront this president with the same Washington mindset and political warfare that led us to this point. If you are watching this at home and you were exhausted by the spectacle of division and dysfunction, I’m asking you to join me to help turn the page on our politics. You’re seeing the President boast about the Dow Jones wondering whether any of that will ever get to your kitchen table. Join me if you’re a voter of color feeling taken for granted by politics as usual. Join me if you’re used to voting for the other party, but right now cannot look your kids in the eye and explain this president to them, join me. We have a chance to change all of this if we can summon the courage to break from the past. That is why I am running for president. It is why I’m asking you to caucus for me on February 3rd and I hope that you will go to peteforamerica.com and join me in this effort. Senator Warren. E. So, much is broken in this country. I sat here in the break and just made notes about many of the things we didn’t get to talk about tonight. How the disability community is struggling for true equality, how gun violence and active shooter drills worry every mother in this country. How children are living in poverty and seeing their life chances shrink. How trans women, particularly trans women of color are at risk. Black infant mortality, climate change that particularly hits black and brown communities. People who are being crushed by student loan debt, farmers who are barely holding on, people struggling with mental illness. And yet I come here tonight with a heart filled with hope and it’s filled with hope because I see this as our moment in history, our moment when no one is left on the sidelines. Our moment when we understand that it comes to us to decide the future of this country. Our moment when we build the movement to make real change, hope and courage. That is how I will make you proud every day as your nominee and as the first woman president of the United States of America. Senator Sanders. It’s been a good debate, but we haven’t asked the major question. The major question is how does it happen in the richest country in the history of the world that half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck, trying to get by, $9, $10 bucks an hour? How does it happen that when the top one percent owns more wealth than the bottom 92%, half a million people are sleeping out on the streets tonight? How does it happen in this great country we are the only major nation not to guarantee healthcare to all. How does that happen that we have a child care system which is dysfunctional, a criminal justice system which is broken and racist, an immigration system that needs reform. This is the moment when we have got to think big, not small. This is the moment where we have got to have the courage to take on the one percent, take on the greed and corruption of the corporate elite and create an economy and create a government that works for all of us, not just the one percent. Thank you. Vice President Biden. Character is on the ballot this time around. The American character is on the ballot. Not what Donald Trump is spewing out, the hate, the xenophobia, the racism. That’s not who we are as a nation. Everyone in this country is entitled to be treated with respect and dignity. Every single solitary person has to have in a position that may in fact we treat them with decency. It’s about fundamental, basic decency. We in the United States of America can put up with … we can overcome four years of Donald Trump, but eight years of Donald Trump will be an absolute disaster and fundamentally change this nation. We have to restore America’s soul. As I’ve said from the moment I announced, it is in jeopardy under this President of the United States. We lead the world when we lead by example, not by our power. We in fact have to regain the respect of the world in order to be able to change things. Ladies and gentlemen, we are in a position right now we have to remember who we are. This is the United States of America. There’s not a single thing beyond our capacity to do if we do it together, let’s go do it. Candidates, thank you very, very much. That concludes the first Democratic presidential debate of 2020. The Iowa caucuses are only 20 days away. Tune into CNN for continuing coverage of this presidential election. Anderson Cooper and Chris Cuomo pickup our coverage right now."
"8","01-16-21"," … thought they’d ever be out of work facing eviction, or waiting hours in their cars for a meal, from a food bank. I talked about how our rescue plan is a necessary bridge to our economic recovery, and our ability to build back better, stronger, and more secure. And while these crises have a cost real damage. I explained how it will cost more, hundreds of billions, of dollars more to undo the harm. I talked about our moral obligation to act and about the clear economic consensus that making the investments I’m calling for, that the resource, that the required deficit spending as the original plans have as well, are necessary to get us out of this deep hole we find ourselves in as a nation. I also talked about our seriousness of purpose. Our clear plan with transparency and accountability, and why our call for unity is equally necessary. Unity is not some pie in the sky dream. It’s a practical step to getting things done. We didn’t get into all of this overnight. We won’t get out of it overnight either. But we will get through it, and we’ll get through it together. And today I’d like to talk more about what that means, and no effort. I mean sparing no effort to get Americans vaccinated. Vice President Harrison and I, we just received a briefing from our COVID team. Truthfully, we remain in a very dark winter. Infection rates are up 34%. more people are being hospitalized because of COVID than ever before. We’re up to between three and 4,000 deaths per day. As we approach a grim milestone of 400,000 deaths in America. That’s staggering to state the obvious. I know the pain that so many of your experience; experiencing right now. Starting by sitting now for breakfast this morning, and staring at an empty chair around the kitchen table. Where a loved one used to sit, laugh, talk about how you love one another. I know the frustration that we’re all feeling. Almost a year later we’re still far from back to normal. The honest truth is this, things will get worse before they get better. I told you, I’ll always level with you. And the policy changes that we’re going to be making are going to take time to show up in the COVID statistics. Not just statistics, it’s people’s lives. People getting infected today, don’t show up in case counts for weeks. Those who perish from this disease die weeks after exposure. So it will take time, but I know there are things we can do and we can do them now. For example, the vaccines offer so much hope, and we’re grateful for the scientists and researchers, and everyone who participated in the clinical trials. We’re grateful for the integrity of the process. The rigorous view and testing that’s led to millions of people around the world already being vaccinated safely. But the vaccine rollout in the United States has been a dismal failure, thus far. And in today’s briefing, we discussed five things. Five things we’ll do in an attempt to turn things around. Five things, to turn frustration into motivation. Five things, to help us meet our goal of 100 million shots by the end of our first 100 days in office. Some wonder if we’re reaching too far for that goal. Is it achievable, is a legitimate question to ask. Let me be clear. I’m convinced we can get it done. And this is a time to set big goals, to pursue them with courage and conviction, because the health of the nation is literally at stake. First, we will immediately work with States to open up vaccinations to more priority groups. The process of establishing priority groups is driven by science, but the problem is the implementation has been too rigid and confusing. If you were to ask most people today, they couldn’t tell you who exactly is getting vaccinated. What they do know is there are tens of millions of doses of vaccine sitting unused in freezers around the country. While people who want and need the vaccine, can’t get it. We’ll fix the problem by encouraging States to allow more people to get vaccinated beyond healthcare workers and move through those groups as quickly as they think we can. That includes anyone, 65 years or older. A population that is accounted for over 80% of the deaths today, 80% of the deaths to date. We’re all set to continue vaccinating frontline, essential workers like educators, first responders, grocery store workers, et cetera. It won’t mean that everyone in this group will get vaccinated immediately, as the supply is not where it needs to be. But it will mean that vaccines become available as they can become available. They’ll reach more people who need them. Will reach out and get the vaccine used. The second thing we’re going to change, if we’re getting more people vaccinated, then we need more vaccination sites. That’s where we’re going to harness the full resources of the Federal Government to establish thousands of community vaccination centers. On my first day in office, I’ll instruct the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA to begin setting up the first of these centers. By the end of our first month in office, we will have 100 federally supported centers across the nation that will ultimately vaccinate millions of people. Think of places that are convenient and accessible; school gymnasiums, sports stadiums, community centers. We’ve already had productive conversations with bipartisan groups of County officials, mayors, governors, tribal leaders, leaders of the private sector who shared their ideas with us about this effort. And as we build them, we’re going to make sure it’s done equitably. We’re going to make sure there are vaccination centers in communities hit hardest by the pandemic. In black and Latino communities, in rural communities as well. Within the first month of our administration, we’re going to deploy mobile clinics. Mobile clinics moving from community to community that will partner with community health centers, and local primary care doctors, to offer vaccines to hard hit and hard to reach commuters; in cities, small towns and rural communities. And to staff up these centers we will mobilize thousands of clinical and nonclinical professionals. Think of the people that we deploy in natural disasters. Experts from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, from FEMA and the Center Of Disease Control, our Public Health Service Commission Corps, our military medical personnel, our first responders. Additionally, we’re going to expand the pool of medical professionals, including retired healthcare workers, who can administer the vaccine. And to ensure we have enough vaccinators to meet the nation’s needs as we ramp this up. And as governors of both parties have asked, our administration will reimburse States 100% when their National Guard is deployed in the fight against COVID. We’ll provide resources to help States cover the cost of personnel; vaccinators, administrative staff. As well as supplies like dry ice and laptops and protective equipment. The third change we’re going to make is we’re going to fully activate the pharmacies across the country to get the vaccination into more arms as quickly as possible. Millions of Americans now turn to the local pharmacies every day for their medicines, flu shots, and much more. We’re going to immediately start new major efforts, working directly with both independent and chain pharmacies to get Americans vaccinated. This program will expand beyond access in neighborhoods across the country so that you can make an appointment and get your shot, conveniently show up at a particular time and get it done quickly. The fourth thing we’re going to do is we’re going to use the full strength of the Federal Government to ramp up supply of the vaccine. As I said before, we’ll use the Defense Production Act to work with private industry, to accelerate the making the materials needed to supply and administer the vaccine. From the tubes and syringes, to protective equipment. And I’ve already asked the team, and we have identified the suppliers who are prepared to work with our teams, and we’re going to work with their teams. Not some day, we’re going to go do this. When I say we’re going to invoke the Defense Production Act, I said, go out, even though we don’t have any authority, go out and identify those companies that are prepared, and will be able to do what we’re going to ask. As you made clear earlier this month, the Trump administrations policy of holding back close to half the supply of the vaccines available did not make sense. Our administration will release the vast majority of the vaccines when they’re available. So more people could get vaccinated quickly, while still retaining a small reserve for any unseen shortage, or delays. But let me be clear, we are not changing the FDA’s recommendation, and its recommended dosing schedules. We believe it’s critical that everyone should get two doses within the FDA recommended timeframe. So we’re not doing away with that availability. Fifth, we will always be honest and transparent about where we stand, both the good news, as well as the bad. We’re going to make sure state and local officials know how much supply they’ll be getting ,and when they can expect to get it so they can plan. Right now, we’re hearing that they can’t plan because they don’t know how much supply of vaccines they can expect and what timeframe. That stops when we’re an office. We’re also promised to provide regular updates to you, the American people, on our progress and our goals. We will be, I promise you, transparent about the decisions we’re making and why we’re making the decisions. You’re entitled to know. Our administration will lead with science and scientist. With the Center For Disease Control, the National Institute Of Health, that will be free and totally free from political influence. A surgeon general who’s independent and speaks directly to the American people. The FDA whose decisions are based on science and science alone, speaking directly to you. Look, while millions of Americans have already gotten the vaccine and millions more are all ready to get it, we also know we need to address vaccine hesitancy and build trust in many communities. We know that’s the case, for example, in black, Latino, and Native American communities. People who have not always been treated with dignity and honesty they deserve by the Federal Government, and the scientific community throughout our history. We also see the disinformation campaigns are already underway to further undermine trust in the vaccines. Our administration will launch a massive public education campaign to rebuild that trust. We’ll help people understand what science tells us, that the vaccines help reduce the risk of COVID infections, and can better safeguard our health, and the health of our families and our communities. It’s a critical piece to account for a tragic reality of the disproportionate impact this virus has had on black, Latinos, and Native American people, who are being infected about four times the rate of white Americans. And dying nearly three times the rate of white Americans. This is unacceptable. It’s unconscionable. Equity is central to our COVID response. The vice-president and I commit to making sure communities of color and rural neighborhoods, those living with disabilities and seniors are not left behind in our vaccination plans. Look, our plan is as clear as it is bold, get more people vaccinated for free. Create more places for them to get vaccinated. Mobilize more medical teams to get the shots in people’s arms. Increase supply, and get it out the door as soon as possible. This will be one of the most challenging operational efforts ever undertaken by our country. But you have my word, and we will manage the hell out of this operation. But as I said last night, we need funding from Congress to make this happen. And I’m optimistic. I’m convinced the American people are ready to spare no effort and no expense to get this done. All these steps will take some time. It may take many months to get where we need to be. There will be stumbles. And yes, I know so much has already been asked of you. And when we’re sworn in next week, we’re going to ask you to keep the faith and keep following what we know works. One of our 100 day challenges is to mask up everyone. The day were inaugurated, I’m going to ask you to mask up for the next 100 days. This is not a political issue. And I will issue an executive order to require mask where I have the authority to do that. For federal workers and federal property, on interstate travel like trains and planes. We’ll also be working with mayors and governors in red States and blue States and ask them to require masking up in their cities and their States. Look, I hope we now know this is not a political issue. This is about saving lives. I know it’s become a partisan issue. But what a stupid, stupid thing for it to happen. This is a patriotic act. We’re asking you, we’re in a war with this virus, and experts say and have shown that wearing a mask from now until April will save as many as 50,000 lives. Quite frankly, it was shocking to see members of the Congress while the Capitol was under siege by a deadly mob of thugs refusing to wear a mask while they were in secure locations. I’m so proud of my congressmen right here in the state of Delaware. Lisa Blunt Rochester, trying to hand out masks when people are lying on the floor, huddled up. And Republican college refusing to put them on. What the hell is the matter with them? It’s time to grow up. Result? At least four members of Congress to date, included a cancer survivor, now have COVID-19 who were in those rooms. For God’s sake, wear a mask, if not for yourself, for your loved ones, for your country. These are real matters of life and death. We need you to stick with hand washing, social distancing, and avoid indoor gatherings with people outside your own household. We’ll be a partner to the States and cities. So where things are working, we’ll help do more of the good work. And when things can improve, we’ll bring more resources to bear, to get folks tested and vaccinated. I promise you, we’re going to work closely with nonprofits, and with the private sector who we know all want to partner with us in this effort. The more people we vaccinate, and the faster we do it, the sooner we can put this pandemic behind us. And the sooner we can build our economy back better, and get back to our lives, and to our loved ones. As we’re seeing during this pandemic, we can’t solve our problems as a divided nation. The only way we come through this is if we come through together, as Americans, fellow Americans. And as the United States of America. Vice President elect Harris and I ran on that vision. And starting at noon on Wednesday, that’s exactly how we’re going to govern, and ask for your help. God bless you all. Keep you safe. May God protect our troops. Thank you. [Crosstalk 00:18:59]. Yes. Okay. [crosstalk 00:19:23]."
"9","01-19-21"," And please welcome Delaware National Guard Chaplain, Major David Murphy to deliver the invocation. The young boy, Samuel was asleep in the temple and the Lord came to him and called him. He got up and went to the elder priest, Eli, and he said, “Here I am for you called.” Eli said to him, “I did not call you. Go back to sleep.” This happened a few more times and finally, Eli realized that it was the Lord who was calling Samuel. So Eli told the young boy, “The next time you hear the call say, ‘Speak Lord for your servant is listening.'” Eli knew that in one sense, he had to let go of Samuel so that Samuel could have a relationship with God and serve him. As we gather here today, as Delaware citizens, in one sense, we are letting go of one of our very own, but only that we can get him back so that he may serve and answer his call to the nation. And so God, our Father, we ask you to guide him with your wisdom, empower him with your strength and gather us all in your love, for this we make our prayer, amen. Amen. Please welcome Governor John Carney. It is indeed a beautiful Delaware day. Welcome to the Joseph R. “Beau” Biden National Guard Reserve Center. General Berry, Senators Carper and Coons, Congresswoman Blunt Rochester, Lieutenant Governor Hall-Long, County Executive Meyer, Mayor Purzycki, other distinguished guests, fellow Delawareans, friends of all, at any time in our state’s history this would be a proud and momentous day. But sending one of our own to the nation’s Capitol to be the next president of the United States and leader of the free world, doesn’t get any better than that. But after the pain and darkness of the past four years and more acutely, the last 10 months, I feel overwhelmed with emotion standing here before you today. We’re here among the men and women of the Delaware National Guard. They’ve answered the call to duty over and over again this past year from COVID-19 testing and contact tracing to delivering meals and school supplies to students, to keeping our streets safe while Delawareans exercise their First Amendment Rights. They have been a bright spot and a source of inspiration for me this past year, as I know, they always have been for you, Joe, and for your family. I have one particular feeling today that’s hard to describe. And it’s one that so many Americans haven’t felt for far too long, and I’m almost afraid to let myself feel it but if I had to put a name to it, I’d call it hope. Joe Biden was born for this moment. He believes and all of us more, I think, than we believe in ourselves. He has kept the faith through some of the darkest days in our nation’s history and through the darkest days of his own. We stand here today at the National Guard headquarters named after Beau, Joe’s pride and joy and Delaware’s as well. Somehow as Joe so often has done over the years, he has picked himself up and brought us along with him. Now, he stands ready to pull this country out of this morass, out of the chaos and onto higher ground. Mr. President-elect, you’ve been a caring boss and a friend to Tracey and me and a respected United States Senator most of my life. When you became vice president, I didn’t think it got any better than that for our small little state. Today, I could not be more proud to be the governor of the state that gave the country Joe Biden. I don’t envy the job ahead of you. Our country is lucky you’re even willing to do it, but you know how much is at stake. And we in Delaware know how much you love our country. You are what this country needs. You are what we all need. And so as you head down to Washington, know that you have the thoughts and prayers of a grateful and incredibly proud State of Delaware. May the wind be always at your back. Ladies and gentlemen, the next president of the United States, Joe Biden. Thank you, Governor and Tracey, and all my friends that are here for everything you’ve done for me and for my family throughout the years. Tommy, you’ve been a friend a long time. I look out there and I see, Mike Purzycki, Mike, I’m glad you’re healthy, man. You’re here pal. I’m really glad, Mike. It’s kind of emotional for me, but look, we went through my whole career and through the good times and the bad and I want to thank you for everything. To my fellow Delawareans and behalf of the entire Biden family that’s here today, I want to express how much you mean to me and to every one of us. In our family, the values we share, the character we strive for, the way we view the world, it all comes from home. It all comes from Delaware. The state that gave my mother and father a home and a livelihood when they needed it most. A state that made my brothers and sister and I, both of whom are here, understand that we could do whatever we dreamed of, whatever that was. And it gave me a chance when I was just a kid to elect me and believed in me and sent me to the United States Senate before going to the County Council, after going to the County Council. Where Jill and I found one another and where she made me strong as Ernest Hemingway wrote, in all the broken places. And the state that loves our children and our grandchildren and loved our Beau and he so loved you right back. General Berry, when the headquarters was named after Beau I told General Vavala at the time, it means everything to me, to Hunter, to Ashley, to Jill, to our whole family. But Beau would be the first to say, “The honor goes to the men and women of the Delaware National Guard and their families who gave so much, who are true Patriots defined by the courage of their character.” And so it’s deeply personal that our next journey to Washington starts here, a place that defines the very best of who we are as Americans. I know these are dark times, but there’s always light. That’s what makes this state so special, that’s what it taught me. It taught me the most. There’s always light. When I came home after graduating from Delaware and then going on to law school at Syracuse, I came home after law school to Wilmington, to our county and it had gone dark. Dr. King was assassinated. Wilmington had been in flames. The National Guard patrolled the streets and that turmoil inspired me to become a public defender, a step I never anticipated would lead me toward this improbable journey. Where 12 years ago, I was waiting at the train station in Wilmington for a black man to pick me up on our way to Washington, where we were sworn in as president and vice president of the United States of America. And here we are today, my family and I, about to return to Washington to meet a black woman of South Asian descent, to be sworn in as president and vice president of the United States. As I told Beau on that station, waiting for Barack and Hunter and Ashley, I said, “Don’t tell me things can’t change. They can and they do.” That’s America, that’s Delaware, a place of hope and light and limitless possibilities. And I’m honored. I’m truly honored to be your next president and commander in chief and I’ll always be a proud son of the State of Delaware. As Tommy or better known as a Chairman Carper, Senator Carper knows my colleagues in the Senate used to always kid me for quoting Irish poets. They thought I did it because I’m Irish. I didn’t do it for that reason. I did it because they’re the best poets in the world. James Joyce was said to have told a friend that when it comes his time to pass, when he dies, he said, “Dublin will be written on my heart.” Well, excuse the emotion, but when I die Delaware will be written on my heart, and the hearts of all of us, all the Bidens. We love you all. You’ve been there for us in the good and the bad. You’ve never walked away and I am proud, proud, proud, proud to be a son of Delaware. I am even more proud to be standing here doing this from the Major Beau Biden facility. Ladies and gentlemen, I only have one regret, he’s not here because we should be introducing him as president, but we have great opportunities. Delaware’s taught us anything’s possible. Anything’s possible in this country. So God bless you all and may God protect our troops. Thank you. Jill told me not to become emotional. I’m Jill’s husband. Rabbi, come here. Thank you. Please welcome, Rabbi Michael Beals to deliver the benediction. You already know the Yiddish word for mensch. It means a person who endeavors to consistently do the right thing, textbook example Joe Biden. Here’s a new Yiddish word for our vocabulary as we send our favorite Delawarean to Washington, beshert. My wife, Dr. Elissa Green, aka Major Biden’s Delaware humane association and veterinarian is my beshert. Dr. Jill Biden is Joe’s beshert proving that both the president-elect and I love doctors and that we both married up. But beshert also means meant to be. It is indeed beshert that you our dear president-elect are being inaugurated on the very week when Jews all around the world are reading from the book of Exodus about Moses freeing us from 400 years of backbreaking, Egyptian slavery at the hands of an autocratic, cruel Pharaoh. In many ways, dear Joe, you are our Moses and vice-president-elect, Kamala Harris is our Aaron. Among your closer Jewish friends together, your administration will always affectionately be known as Mamala and a mensch. Stay safe our dear friend, defeat the plague of COVID-19, rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and kickstart our sluggish economy. On the week we honor Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Rid us of the scourge of 400 years of institutional racism. Deal aggressively and boldly with the global climate change for the sake of our children’s future and find allies on both sides of the aisle to pass your legislation, helping us heal our riffs so with sincerity, we can declare the words of Psalm 133, behold, how good and pleasant it is when brothers and sisters dwell together in unity. And in all of these mighty endeavors, invite God in to help you do the heavy lifting with you. You are never alone. You have God and you have us. Allow me to conclude my dear friend, President-elect Biden with the same blessing I gave you six years ago, when you first publicly declared me your rabbi. And I’m proud of that. At that Jewish New Year celebration, I offered you a blessing. You enthusiastically said, “Yes,” you lowered your head reverently. In pre-COVID fashion, I laid my hands on your forehead and pulling from the book of the Numbers, I blessed you with the following. [foreign language 00:20:24]. May God bless you and keep you. [foreign language 00:20:33]. May God cause his face to shine upon you and to be gracious to you. [foreign language 00:20:40]. May God lift his face towards you, be gracious to you and give you that most precious gift of all, the gift of wholeness, the gift of completeness, the gift of peace and let us all say, amen. Amen. Thank you, thank you. Thank you. [inaudible 00:21:04]."
"10","01-20-21"," Chief Justice Roberts, Vice president Harris, Speaker Pelosi, Leader Schumer, Leader McConnell, Vice President Pence, and my distinguished guests, my fellow Americans. This is America’s day. This is democracy’s day. A day of history and hope of renewal and resolve through a crucible for the ages. America has been tested anew and America has risen to the challenge. Today we celebrate the triumph, not of a candidate, but of a cause, the cause of democracy. The people, the will of the people, has been heard and the will of the people has been heeded. We’ve learned again that democracy is precious. Democracy is fragile. And at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed. So now on this hallowed ground where just a few days ago violence sought to shake the capital’s very foundation. We come together as one nation, under God, indivisible, to carry out the peaceful transfer of power as we have for more than two centuries. As we look ahead in our uniquely American way, restless, bold, optimistic, and set our sights on the nation we know we can be, and we must be. I thank my predecessors of both parties for their presence here today. I thank them from the bottom of my heart, and I know the resilience of our constitution and the strength, the strength of our nation, as does president Carter who I spoke with last night, who cannot be with us today, but whom we salute for his lifetime and service. I’ve just taken a sacred oath each of those patriots have taken. The oath first sworn by George Washington. But the American story depends not in any one of us, not on some of us, but on all of us. On we the people who seek a more perfect union. This is a great nation. We are good people. And over the centuries through storm and strife, in peace and in war, we’ve come so far, but we still have far to go. We’ll press forward with speed and urgency for we have much to do in this winter of peril and significant possibilities. Much to repair, much to restore, much to heal, much to build and much to gain. Few people in our nation’s history have been more challenged or found a time more challenging or difficult than the time we’re in now. Once in a century virus that silently stalks the country, has taken as many lives in one year as America lost in all of World War II. Millions of jobs have been lost. Hundreds of thousands of businesses closed. A cry for racial justice, some 400 years in the making, moves us. The dream of justice for all will be deferred no longer. A cry for survival comes from planet itself. A cry that can’t be any more desperate or any more clear, and now arise a political extremism, white supremacy, domestic terrorism that we must confront and we will defeat. To overcome these challenges, to restore the soul and secure the future of America, requires so much more than words. It requires the most elusive of all things in a democracy; unity, unity. And another January on New Year’s Day in 1863, Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation. When he put pen to paper, the president said and I quote, “If my name ever goes down into history, it will be for this act, and my whole soul is in it.” My whole soul was in it today on this January day, my whole soul is in this. Bringing America together, uniting our people, uniting our nation, and I ask every American to join me in this cause. Uniting to fight the foes we face: anger, resentment and hatred, extremism, lawlessness, violence, disease, joblessness, and hopelessness. With unity we can do great things, important things. We can right wrongs. We can put people to work in good jobs. We can teach our children in safe schools. We can overcome the deadly virus. We can reward work and rebuild the middle class and make healthcare secure for all. We can deliver racial justice and we can make America once again, the leading force for good in the world. I know speaking of unity can sound to some like a foolish fantasy these days. I know the forces that divide us are deep and they are real. But I also know they are not new. Our history has been a constant struggle between the American ideal, that we all are created equal, and the harsh ugly reality that racism, nativism, fear, demonization have long torn us apart. The battle is perennial and victory is never assured. Through Civil War, the Great Depression, World War, 9/11, through struggle, sacrifice and setbacks our better angels have always prevailed. In each of these moments, enough of us, enough of us have come together to carry all of us forward, and we can do that now. History, faith, and reason show the way, the way of unity. We can see each other, not as adversaries, but as neighbors. We can treat each other with dignity and respect. We can join forces, stop the shouting and lower the temperature, for without unity there is no peace, only bitterness and fury. No progress, only exhausting outrage. No nation, only a state of chaos. This is our historic moment of crisis and challenge, and unity is the path forward. And we must meet this moment as the United States of America. If we do that, I guarantee you, we will not fail. We have never, ever, ever, ever failed in America when we’ve acted together. And so today, at this time in this place, let’s start afresh all of us. Let’s begin to listen to one another again, hear one another, see one another, show respect to one another. Politics doesn’t have to be a raging fire, destroying everything in its path. Every disagreement doesn’t have to be a cause for total war. And we must reject the culture in which facts themselves are manipulated and even manufactured. My fellow Americans, we have to be different than this. America has to be better than this, and I believe America is so much better than this. Just look around. Here we stand in the shadow of the Capitol Dome as it was mentioned earlier, completed amid the Civil War when the Union itself was literally hanging in the balance. Yet we endured, we prevailed. Here we stand looking out on the great mall where Dr. King spoke of his dream. Here we stand where 108 years ago at another inaugural thousands of protesters tried to block brave women marching for the right to vote. And today we mark the swearing in of the first woman in American history, elected to national office, Vice President Kamala Harris. Don’t tell me things can’t change. Here we stand across the Potomac from Arlington Cemetery, where heroes who gave the last full measure of devotion rest in eternal peace. And here we stand just days after a riotous mob thought they could use violence to silence the will of the people, to stop the work of our democracy, to drive us from this sacred ground. It did not happen. It will never happen. Not today, not tomorrow, not ever, not ever. For all of those who supported our campaign, I’m humbled by the faith you’ve placed in us. To all those who did not support us, let me say this. Hear me out as we move forward. Take a measure of me and my heart. If you still disagree, so be it. That’s democracy. That’s America, the right to dissent peaceably within the guard rails of our Republic is perhaps this nation’s greatest strength. Yet hear me clearly, disagreement must not lead to disunion. And I pledge this to you, I will be a president for all Americans, all Americans. And I promise you, I will fight as hard for those who did not support me, as for those who did. Many centuries ago, Saint Augustine, a Saint in my church wrote that a people was a multitude defined by the common objects of their love, defined by the common objects of their love. What are the common objects we as Americans love that define us as Americans? I think we know: opportunity security, liberty, dignity, respect, honor and yes, the truth. Recent weeks and months, I’ve taught us a painful lesson. There is truth, and there are lies. Lies toll for power and for profit, and each of us has a duty and a responsibility as citizens, as Americans, and especially as leaders, leaders who have pledged to honor our Constitution and protect our nation to defend the truth and defeat the lies. Look, I understand that many of my fellow Americans view the future with fear and trepidation. I understand they worry about their jobs. I understand like my dad, they lay in bed at night, staring at the ceiling wondering, “Can I keep my healthcare? Can I pay my mortgage?” Thinking about their families, about what comes next. I promise you I get it. But the answer is not to turn inward, to retreat into competing factions, distrusting those who don’t look like you or worship the way you do, or don’t get their news from the same sources you do. We must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue, rural versus urban, conservative versus liberal. We can do this, if we open our souls, instead of hardening our hearts. If we show a little tolerance and humility, and if we’re willing to stand in the other person’s shoes, as my mom would say, just for a moment, stand in their shoes. Because here’s the thing about life. There’s no accounting for what fate will deal you. Some days when you need a hand, there are other days when we’re called to lend a hand. That’s how it has to be, it’s what we do for one another. And if we are this way, our country will be stronger, more prosperous, more ready for the future, and we can still disagree. My fellow Americans in the work ahead of us we’re going to need each other. We need all our strength to persevere through this dark winter. We’re entering what may be the toughest and deadliest period of the virus. We must set aside politics and finally face this pandemic as one nation, one nation. And I promise you this, as the Bible says, “Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.” We will get through this together, together. Look, folks, all my colleagues I serve with in the House and the Senate up here, we all understand the world is watching, watching all of us today. So here’s my message to those beyond our borders, America has been tested and we’ve come out stronger for it. We will repair our alliances and engage with the rural once again, not to meet yesterday’s challenges, but today’s and tomorrow’s challenges. And we’ll lead not merely by the example of our power, but by the power of our example. It will be a strong and trusted partner for peace, progress, and security. Look, you all know we’ve been through so much in this nation. And my first act as president, I’d like to ask you to join me in a moment of silent prayer to remember all those who we lost this past year to the pandemic, those 400,000 fellow Americans: moms, dads, husbands, wives, sons, daughters, friends, neighbors, and coworkers. We’ll honor them by becoming the people and the nation we know we can and should be. So I ask you, let’s say a silent prayer for those who’ve lost their lives and those left behind and for our country. Amen. Folks, this is a time of testing. We face an attack on our democracy and untruth. A raging virus, growing inequity, the sting of systemic racism, a climate in crisis, America’s role in the world. Any one of these would be enough to challenge us in profound ways. But the fact is we face them all at once, presenting this nation with one of the gravest responsibilities we’ve had. Now, we’re going to be tested. Are we going to step up, all of us? It’s time for boldness, for there’s so much to do. And this is certain, I promise you, we will be judged you and I, by how we resolve these cascading crises of our era. We will rise to the occasion is the question. Will we master this rare and difficult hour? When we meet our obligations and pass along a new and better world to our children, I believe we must. I’m sure you do as well. I believe we will. And when we do, we’ll write the next great chapter in the history of the United States of America, the American story. A story that might sound something like a song that means a lot to me. It’s called American Anthem. There’s one verse that stands out, at least for me. And it goes like this, “The work and prayers of century have brought us to this day. What shall be our legacy? What will our children say? Let me know in my heart, when my days are through America, America, I gave my best to you.” Let’s add, let’s us add our own work and prayers to the unfolding story of our great nation. If we do this, then when our days are through, our children and our children’s children will say of us, “They gave their best. They did their duty. They healed a broken land. My fellow Americans, I close today where I began, with the sacred oath. Before God and all of you, I give you my word. I will always level with you. I will defend the Constitution. I’ll defend our democracy. I’ll defend America and will give all, all of you keep everything I do in your service. Thinking not of power, but of possibilities. Not of personal interest, but the public good and together we shall write an American story of hope, not fear, of unity not division, of light not darkness. A story of decency and dignity, love and healing, greatness and goodness. May this be the story that guides us, the story that inspires us and the story that tells ages yet to come, that we answer the call of history. We met the moment. Democracy and hope, truth and justice did not die on our watch, but thrived. That America secured liberty at home and stood once again as a beacon to the world. That is what we owe our forebearers, one another and generation to follow. So with purpose and resolve, we turn to those task of our time, sustained by faith, driven by conviction, devoted to one another and the country we love with all our hearts. May God bless America and may God protect our troops. Thank you, America."
"11","01-21-21"," Before I begin today’s announcement, let me take a few moments to thank all the law enforcement folks for all they did, the military personnel, from all across the Federal State and local agencies to secure yesterday’s inaugural activities. And a special thanks to the members of the National Guard from around the country. It was an unprecedented situation. Hopefully, never have to be renewed again. And everyone with the most professionalism and duty and honor that could be expected. As president, as Commander In Chief, I always respect and Revere their service and that of their families. But now to today’s announcement, Vice-President Harris and I were joined by members of our COVID-19 team, response team, and Dr. Tony Fauci, our Chief COVID medical adviser. Xavier Becerra, excuse me, our nominee for Secretary Of Health And Human Services. Dr. Vivek Murthy, our nominee for Surgeon General. Dr. Rochelle Willinsky, she’s going to be the director for the Centers For Disease Control Prevention. And Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith, who will be leading our equity work and the COVID response. And Jeff Zients and Natalie Quillian, who are managing this whole effort. Yesterday, during my inaugural address, I offered as salient prayer, and silent prayer, it was both salient and silent. I thought it was important that people understand what had happened, that we all pay tribute to the… Our prayers for those 400,000 Americans who’ve lost their lives in this pandemic. On Tuesday, Jill and I, Kamala and Doug, we stood at the Reflecting Pool in front of the Lincoln Memorial and joined Americans all across the country to remember those 400,000 moms and dads, husbands, and wives, children, sons, daughters. And I said at that moment, that, “To heal, we must remember.” To heal, we must remember. It’s important to do that as a nation. We must also act though, not just remember. Yet for the past a year, we couldn’t rely on the Federal Government to act with the urgency and focus, and coordination we needed. And we have seen the tragic cost of that failure. Three to 4,000 deaths per day. To date, more than 24 million Americans, 24 million Americans have been infected. To put that in context, America makes up 4% of the world’s population, but 25% of the world’s confirmed COVID-19 cases, and nearly 20% of all the COVID 19 deaths, when we have 4% of the world’s population. The pandemic has disproportionately impacted on blacks, Latinos, and Native Americans who are about four times as likely to be hospitalized, and nearly three times more likely to die from the COVID-19 pandemic than white Americans. Hospitals are out of beds. Businesses are closed for good. Schools are caught in between. And while the vaccine provides so much hope, the rollout has been a dismal failure thus far. So I understand the despair and frustration of so many Americans, and how they’re feeling. I understand why many governors, mayors, county officials, tribal leaders feel like they’re left on their own without a clear national plan to get them through the crisis. Let me be very clear. Things are going to continue to get worse before they get better. The Memorial we held two nights ago will not be our last one, unfortunately. The death toll will likely top 500,000 next month. The cases will continue to mount. We didn’t get into this mess overnight. That’s going to take months for us to turn things around. But let me be equally clear, we will get through this. We will defeat this pandemic. And to a nation waiting for action let me be the clearest on this point, help is on the way. Today, I am unveiling a national strategy on COVID-19, and executive actions to beat this pandemic. This plan reflects the ideas I set forward during the campaign and further refined over the past three months. It consists of my transitions teams, the taskforce, Tony Fauci, and the team here today, and other experts put this plan together. Our national strategy is comprehensive. It’s based on science, not politics. It’s based on truth, not denial. And it’s detailed. You can review this entire plan, this entire plan by going to WhiteHouse.gov. It is so detailed, it’s 198 pages. And complete detail, what we’re going to do. Our plan starts with mounting an aggressive, safe, and effective vaccination campaign to meet our goal of administering 100 million shots, in our first 100 days in office, we’re on day one. This will be one of the greatest operational challenges our nation has ever undertaken, and I’m committed to getting it done. We’re committed to getting it done. And as I explained last week, we’ll move heaven and earth to get more people vaccinated for free, and create more places for them to get vaccinated, to mobilize more medical teams to get shots in people’s arms, and to increase vaccine supply, and get it out the door as fast as possible. Yesterday, we got started. We directed the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, to start standing up the first federally supported community vaccination centers with the goal of standing up 100 centers within the next month. The Centers For Disease Control And Prevention will launch the federal Pharmacy Program to make vaccines available to communities and their local pharmacies, beginning early within, I think it’s by the seventh or eighth, February. In very early February. We’ll also task the Department Of Health and Human Services to prepare and expand the pool of medical professionals who can administer the vaccine. Who can administer the vaccine. And to ensure we have enough vaccinators, the people doing the vaccines, to meet the nation’s needs and quickly. In addition to this effort, our administration, will be asking Congress for the funds to grow the public health workforce. We also, are going to take immediate steps to partner with governors, mayors, and other local officials, who we’ve been talking to all along, who are on the front lines of this fight. We directed FEMA to establish a COVID response liaison for each state. Which means every state will have a point person at the federal level to maximize cooperation between the Federal Government and the States. And where it falls short, to be made known about it immediately. This is a model we use to respond to Hurricane Sandy, which I was deeply involved with. And in just a few moments, I’m going to sign a declaration to immediately begin reimbursing States 100% for the use of their National Guards to help COVID relief efforts. Something Democrats and Republicans governors alike have called for. But the brutal truth is, it’s going to take eight months before we can get the majority of Americans vaccinated. So while we increase vaccinations, we’re going to take steps necessary now to slow the spread of the disease as well. One of our 100 day challenges is asking the American people to mask up for the first 100 days, the next 99 days. But masks can become a partisan issue, unfortunately. But it’s a patriotic act. But for a few months to wear a mask, no vaccines, the fact is that they’re the single best thing we can do. They’re even more important than the vaccines because they take time to work. And if we do this as Americans, the experts say by wearing a mask from now until April, we’d save more than 50,000 lives going forward; 50,000 lives. So I’m asking every American to mask up for the next hundred days. Yesterday, I signed an executive action that requires mask and social distancing on federal property. Today we’ll be signing an additional executive action to extend masking requirements on interstate travel, like on trains, planes, and buses. And, in light of the new COVID variance that you’re learning about, we’re instituting now a new measure for individuals flying into the United States from other countries. In addition to wearing masks, everyone flying to the United States from another country will need to test before they get on that plane, before they depart, and quarantine when they arrive in America. Our national plan launches a full scale war time effort to address the supply shortages by ramping up production and protective equipment, syringes, needles, you name it. And when I say war time, people kind of look at me like, “War time?” Well, as I said, last night, 400,000 Americans have died. That’s more than have died in all of World War II; 400,000. This is a war time undertaking. Today, I’m signing an executive action to use the Defense Production Act and all other available authorities to direct all federal agencies, and private industry to accelerate the making of everything that’s needs to protect, test, vaccinate and take care of our people. We’ve already identified suppliers and we’re working with them on to move the plan forward. Look, our strategy includes a plan to safely reopen schools and businesses while protecting our workers. Today, we’re directing the Department Of Education and the Department Of Health And Human Services to immediately provide schools and communities with clear guidance and resources to safely reopen the schools and childcare centers. And by the way, when you do that, think of all the people that can get back to work, be able to get back to work; all the mothers and single fathers that are staying home, taking care of their children. We’re going to put the full force of the federal government behind expanding testing by launching a COVID-19 pandemic testing board. This effort will ensure that we get testing to where it is needed and where it’s needed most; helping schools and businesses reopened safely. And protecting the most vulnerable by those who live in long-term care facilities. And for the millions of workers, many of whom are people of color, immigrants and low wage workers, who continue to put their lives on the line to keep this country going through the pandemic. I’m calling for the enforcement of a more stringent worker safety standards so that you are better protected from this virus while you have to continue to work, to protect the rest of us. Our plan also protects those most at risk, and works for everyone, of all races and urban, rural communities alike. Today, I’m formalizing the Health Equity Task Force that we announced in the transition led by the brilliant Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith. Who ensures that it’s going to ensure that equality is at the core of every decision we make. That includes addressing vaccine hesitancy and building trust in communities. As well as fighting disinformation campaigns that are already underway. Above all, our plan is to restore public trust. We will make sure that scientists and public health experts will speak directly to you. That’s why you’re going to hear a lot more from Dr. Fauci again. Not from the president, but from the real genuine experts and scientists. We’re going to make sure they work free from political interference. That they make decisions strictly based on science and healthcare alone. Science and health alone, not what the political consequences are. The Vice President Harris and I, and our entire administration will always be honest and transparent with you about both the good news, the bad. We will level with you, when we make a mistake. We’ll straight up say what happened. And I said at the outset, the honest truth is we’re still in a dark winter of this pandemic. It’s going to get worse before it gets better. It’s going to take many months to get where we need to be. Progress [inaudible 00:13:38] our plan will take time to measure as people getting infected today, they don’t show up as case counts for weeks. And those who perished from this disease die weeks after their exposure, despite the best intentions. We’re going to face setbacks, which I will always explain to you. But also know, we can do this if we come together. That’s why, ultimately our plan is based on unity and all of us acting as one nation. It requires families and neighbors looking out for one another. Healthcare providers and business, and civic, and religious, and civil rights organizations, and unions all relying together on a common purpose. With urgency and purpose, and resolve. It requires reasserting our global leadership. Which is why I took an action yesterday for the United States to rejoin the World Health Organization. And to reestablish, our Global Pandemic Office, and the National Security Council. It requires Congress coming together to provide the necessary funding, in the COVID relief package and the American Rescue Plan that I will soon be sending to the Congress. I know these bold practical steps will not come cheaply, but failing to do so will cost us so much more dearly. I look forward to working with members of both parties in the Congress. We’re in a national emergency and it’s time we treat it like one. Together, and the national plan, as the United States of America. As I said yesterday at my inaugural address, there are moments in history when more is asked of a particular generation, more asked of us as Americans than other times, we are in that moment now. History is going to measure whether we’re up to the task. I believe we are. The American people have given so much already, but I believe they’re ready to set big goals and pursue them with courage, conviction, and honesty because the health of the nation is literally at stake. It’s not hyperbole. I’m convinced the American people are ready as well to spare no effort, no expense to get this done. What could be more important? The more people we vaccinate, and the faster we do it, the sooner we can put this pandemic behind us, and the sooner we can build our economy back and build it back better. And get back to our lives and to our loved ones. We can do this. We can do this if we stand together as fellow Americans, and as the United States of America. So God bless those lost souls in this pandemic and their families, all they left behind. May God bless all of you on the front lines, when defined the best of who we are as Americans. Thank you very much. Now, I’m going to go over to this desk and sign these executive actions. But again, this is the plan. This is the plan. You can go online and get it. I know it’s a lot of heavy reading, but it’s all laid out in stark detail here. Thank you. This executive order I’m signing is [inaudible 00:17:14] in supply chain. This next one is keeping workers safe and how to do that. [inaudible 00:17:42]. This next one is ensuring equitable response. I guess I should take this out this way. The pens are going to pop on you. Sure can. There you go. This next one is when I referenced about traveling to America, this is the promoting safe travel. This next on is setting up the pandemic testing board. Thank you. My pleasure. This next one is studying the safe schools initiative. This next one is dictating the COVID data that has to be maintained and recorded. Next one is making sure that the National Guard and FEMA support is available. This next one relates to expanding access to care and treatment for COVID-19. And the last one is our global response directive. [crosstalk 00:20:37]. Mr.President, you said you set the goal at 100 million vaccines in the [crosstalk 00:20:43] is that high enough? Shouldn’t you set the bar higher? That’s basically where the US is right now. When I announced it, you all said, “It’s not possible.” Come on, give me a break man. It’s a good start. 100 million. Thank you. Come on you guys [crosstalk 00:20:53]. Let’s go. [crosstalk 00:20:54]. Come on you guys, let’s go. [crosstalk 00:20:55]. Let’s go. Thank you guys. Thank you guys. Thank you very much. Thank you. [crosstalk 00:21:08]. Okay. Come on, let’s go. [crosstalk 00:21:11] let’s go. Thank you. Come on guys."
"12","01-22-21"," Good afternoon, folks. Vice President Harris and I just received a briefing from our economic team and we remain in a once in a century public health crisis that’s led to the most unequal job and economic crisis in modern history. And the crisis is only deepening. It’s not getting better. It’s deepening. Yesterday, we learned that 900,000 more Americans filed for unemployment, 900,000. They join millions of Americans who through no fault of their own, have lost the dignity and respect that comes with a job and a paycheck. So many of them never thought they’d ever be out of work in the first place, just like my dad did when he was used to lie awake at night when I was a kid staring at the ceiling unable to sleep, because he worried about whether or not he’s about to lose his health care. Or whether we were going to have the money to pay the mortgage, because of the economic circumstance he was in. And now a lot of these folks are facing eviction or waiting hours in their cars, literally hours in their cars waiting to be able to feed their children as they drive up to a food bank. This is the United States of America and they’re waiting to feed their kids. Folks who are able to still keep their job, many have seen their paychecks reduced and they’re barely hanging on and wondering what’s next. Sometimes the anxiety about what’s going to happen next is more consequential than what actually happened, but this is happening today in America. And this cannot be who we are as a country. These are not the values of our nation. We cannot, will not let people go hungry. We cannot let people be evicted because of nothing they did themselves. I cannot watch people lose their jobs and we have to act. We have to act now. It’s not just to meet them moral obligation to treat our fellow Americans with the dignity respect they deserve. This is an economic imperative, a growing economic and consensus that we must act decisively and boldly to grow the economy for all Americans, not just for tomorrow, but in the future. There’s a growing course of top economists that agree. That in this moment of crisis with interest rates as low as they are, historic lows, it is smart fiscal investment, including deficit spending, and they’re more urgent than ever. And that return on these investments in jobs and racial equity is going to prevent long-term economic damage and benefits that are going to far surpass their costs. If we don’t act, the rest of the world is not standing still in terms of their competitive advantage or the competitive possibilities relative to us. That our debt situation will be more stable and not less stable according to these economists. And that such investments in our people is going to strengthen our economic competitiveness as a nation and help us out-compete our competitors in the global economy, because we’re going to grow the economy with these investments. While the COVID-19 package that passed in December was the first step. As I said, at the time, it’s just a down payment. We need more action and we need to move fast. Last week, I laid out a two-step plan of rescue and recovery to get through the crisis and to a better and stronger and more secure America. The first step of our American Rescue Plan is a plan to tackle the pandemic and get direct financial relief to Americans who need it the most. In just a few days, it’s just been a few days since I outlined this plan and it’s received bipartisan support from the majority of American mayors and governors. Businesses and labor organizations have together welcomed it as an urgent action that’s needed. Even Wall Street firms have underscored its importance. In fact, an analysis by Moody’s estimates that if we pass our American Rescue Plan, the economy would create 7.5 million jobs just in this year alone. That would be on the way to the more than 18 million, I think it was 18,600,000 jobs that they believe would be created over the four year period with our Build Back Better recovery plan. And with our American Rescue Plan, our economy would return to full employment a full year faster than without the plan, even President Trump’s. President Trump’s now, not some liberal organization. President Trump’s top former economic advisor, Kevin Hassett said, quote, “He absolutely is in favor of this rescue plan. This almost doesn’t have a partisan piece to it. We’re seeing the support because this plan takes a step that we so urgently need. More than just a step number of steps. It funds big parts of the COVID-19 national strategy that I released yesterday, we released yesterday. Our national strategy puts us on a war footing to aggressively speed up our COVID-19 response, especially on vaccines and testing and reopening our schools. I found it fascinating yesterday, the press asked the question is a 100 million enough? Week before they were saying, “Biden, you’re crazy. You can’t do 100 million in 100 days.” Well, we’re going to God-willing not only do 100 million, we’re going to do more than that, but we have to do this. We have to move. The American Rescue Plan also includes economic relief for most Americans who are in need. We’re going to finish the job of getting a total of $2,000 in direct payments to folks. $600, which was already passed is simply not enough. If you still have to choose between paying your rent, putting food on the table, we’ll extend unemployment insurance benefits for millions of workers beyond the deadline that’s now set. It means that 16 million Americans who are currently relying on unemployment benefits while they look for work can count on these checks continuing to be there in the middle of this crisis. The American Rescue Plan also addresses the growing housing crisis in America. Approximately 14 million Americans, 14 million have fallen behind on rent and many risk eviction. If we fail to act, there’ll be a wave of evictions and foreclosures in the coming months as this pandemic rages on. Because there’s nothing we can do to change the trajectory of the pandemic in the next several months. So look, this should overwhelm emergency shelters, increase COVID-19 infections as people have nowhere to go and can’t socially distance. The American Rescue Plan asked Congress to provide rental assistance for millions of hard hit families and tenants. This will also be a bridged economic recovery for countless mom and pop landlords who can’t afford not to have the rent, but they can’t wait. So on Inauguration Day, I directed my administration to extend nationwide restrictions on evictions and foreclosures. These crises are straining the budgets of states and cities and tribal communities that are forced to consider layoffs and service reductions among essential workers, police officers, firefighters, first responders, nurses are all at the risk of losing their jobs. Over the last year, more than 600,000 educators have lost their jobs in cities and towns. The American Rescue Plan will provide emergency funding to keep these essential workers on the job and maintain essential services. Look, it will also help small businesses that are the engines of our economic growth. When you say small business, most people think the major corporate entities are the ones who hire everybody. These small businesses are the glue that hold and they’re important, but these small businesses that glue and hold these communities together. They are hurting badly and they account for nearly half of the entire us workforce, nearly half. Our rescue plan will provide flexible grants to help the hardest hit small businesses to survive the pandemic. And low cost capital to help entrepreneurs of all backgrounds create and maintain jobs, plus provide essential goods and services that communities so desperately depend on. Look, our recovery plan also calls for an increase in the minimum wage at 15, at least $15 an hour. No one in America should work 40 hours a week making below the poverty line. $15 gets people above the poverty line. We have so many millions of people working 40 hours a week working and some with two jobs, and they’re still below the poverty line. Our plan access to affordable childcare. That’s going to enable parents, particularly women to get back to work. Millions are not working now because they don’t have that care. All told, the American Rescue Plan would lift 12 million Americans out of poverty and cut child poverty in half. That’s five million children lifted out of poverty. Our plan will reduce poverty in the black community by one third and reduce poverty and Hispanic community by almost 40%. I look forward to working with members of Congress of both parties to move quickly to get this American Rescue Plan to the American people. And then we can move with equal urgency and bipartisanship to the second step of our economic plan to Build Back Better, the recovery plan. It’s a plan that’s going to make historic investments in infrastructure, manufacturing, innovation, research and development, and clean energy and so much more that’s going to create millions more jobs. Good paying jobs, not minimum wage jobs. It will only work with members of both parties in the Congress. There are steps that we can and must take right now. For example, on Inauguration Day, I directed my administration to pause student loan repayments for interest for the interest payments for Americans with federal student loans until at least September. So they’re not going to have to pay till September. They still pay the bill as it stands now, but they will not accrue interest and they don’t have to pay, begin to pay until September. And we may have to look beyond that I might add. Today, I’m signing an executive order that directs the whole of government, a whole of government effort to help millions of Americans who were badly hurting. Requires all federal agencies to do what they can do to provide relief to families, small businesses and communities. And in the days ahead, I expect agencies to act. Let me touch on two ways these actions can help change Americans’ lives. We need to tackle the growing hunger crisis in America. One in seven households in America, one in seven, more than one in five black and Latino households in America report they do not have enough food to eat. That includes nearly 30 million adults and as many as 12 million children. And again, they’re in this situation through no fault of their own. It’s unconscionable. The American Rescue Plan provides additional emergency food and nutrition assistance for tens of millions of children and families to address this crisis. But families literally can’t wait another day. As a result of the executive order I’m going to shortly sign, the Department of Agriculture will consider taking immediate steps to make it easier for the hardest hit families to enroll and claim more generous benefits in the critical food and nutrition assistance area. This is going to help tens of millions of families, especially those who can’t provide meals for their kids, who are learning remotely at home who are not receiving the regular meal plans that they have at school for breakfast or lunch. We also need to protect the health and safety of the American worker. Right now, approximately 40% of households in America have at least one member with a pre-existing condition. Just imagine, you’re out of work through no fault of your own, you file for unemployment while you’re looking for a job, you find one and you get an offer. But then you find out if there’s a high risk of you’re getting infected with COVID-19 because of your condition and you and your loved ones have even greater risk of death and serious illness because of the pre-existing conditions, so you turn it down. Right now if you did that, you could be denied unemployment insurance because you’re offered a job, you didn’t take it. It’s wrong. No one should have to choose between their livelihoods and their own health, or the health of their loved ones in the middle of a deadly pandemic. Because of the executive order I’m about to sign, I expect the Department of Labor to guarantee the right to refuse employment that will jeopardize your health. And if you do so, you’ll still be able to qualify for the insurance. That’s a judgment the Labor Department will make. Look, they’re just two consequential ways that the action I’m taking today will help people in need. Another way to help approximately two million veterans maintain their financial footing by pausing federal collections on over payments and debts. Another, make sure that federal contractors are receiving taxpayers’ dollars, provide their workers with the pay and benefits they deserve. These are places where federal tax dollars are administered or being made available to build things from ships to staircases. And we let out the federal government lets the contract and we’re going to make sure that they buy American and are made in America. And here’s another. Right now there are up to 8 million people that are eligible for direct payments from the CARES Act and a relief bill passed in December. They’re entitled to those payments, but there’s not an easy way for those folks to access to them. So we’re making it a priority today to fix that problem and get them relief they’re entitled to. Look, I’m going to close and summarize this way. A lot of America’s hurting. The virus is surging. We’re 400,000 dead, expected to reach well over 600,000. Families are going hungry. People are at risk of being evicted. Job losses are mounting again. We need to act. No matter how you look at it, we need to act. If we act now, our economy will be stronger in both the short and long run. That’s what economist left, right and center telling us. Both liberal and conservative will be better and stronger across the board. If we act now, we’ll be better able to compete with the world. If we act now, we’ll be better able to meet our moral obligations to one another as Americans. I don’t believe that people in this country just want to stand by and watch their friends, their neighbors, co-workers, fellow Americans go hungry, lose their homes or lose the sense of dignity and hope and respect. I don’t believe that, especially in the middle of a pandemic that’s so weakened and wrecked so much havoc and cause so much pain on America. That’s not who we are. The bottom line is this. We’re in a national emergency. We need to act like we’re in a national emergency. So we’ve got to move with everything we’ve got and we’ve got to do it together. I don’t believe Democrats or Republicans are going hungry and losing jobs. I believe Americans are going hungry and losing their jobs, and we have the tools to fix it. We have the tools to get through this. We have the tools to get this virus under control and our economy back on track. And we have the tools to help people. So let’s use the tools, all of them, use them now. So I’m going to sign this executive order, but let me conclude again by saying. Folks, this is one of the cases where business, labor Wall Street, Main Street, liberal, conservative, economists know we have to act now not only to help people who are in need now, but to allow us to be in a competitive position worldwide and be the leader of the world economy in the next year or two and three and going forward. So thank you. I’m going to sign this executive order. The first one is the economic relief related to COVID-19 pandemic that I referenced. The second one is protecting the federal workforce. Thank you very much. Mr. I haven’t heard the detail of it, but I do think that having some time to get our administration up and running [inaudible 00:21:12] I want to thank the Senate for passing out our Secretary of Defense. It looks like our Secretary of Treasury. It looks like our Secretary of State’s in place. So the more time we have to get up and running and meet these crises, the better. Thank you. Anything to say on Hank Aaron? Mr. President, any comments on Hank Aaron? What did he say-"
"13","01-25-21"," … If that’s okay with y’all. Last week, we immediately got to work to contain the pandemic and deliver economic relief to millions of Americans who need it the most. And today we’re getting to work to rebuild the backbone of American manufacturing unions, the middle class is based on a simple premise that will reward work, not wealth in this country. And the key plank of ensuring the future will be made in America. I’ve long said that I don’t accept the defeatist view that the forces of automation and globalization can’t keep union jobs from growing here in America. We can create more of them, not fewer of them. I don’t buy for one second that the vitality of American manufacturing is a thing of the past. American manufacturing was the arsenal of the democracy in World War II and it must be part of the engine of American prosperity now. That means we are going to use taxpayers’ money to rebuild America. We’ll buy American products and support American jobs, union jobs. For example, the federal government every year spends approximately $600 billion in government procurement to keep the country going safe and secure. And there’s a law that’s been on the books for almost a century now to make sure that that money was spent, taxpayers’ dollars for procurement is spent to support American jobs and American businesses. But the previous administration didn’t take it seriously enough. Federal agencies waived the Buy American requirement without much pushback at all. Big corporations and special interests have long fought for loopholes to redirect American taxpayers dollars to foreign companies for the products that are being made. The result, tens of billions of American taxpayers dollars supporting foreign jobs and foreign industries. In 2018 alone, the department spent $3 billion, the Defense Department on foreign construction contracts leaving American steel and iron out in the cold. It spent nearly 300 million in foreign engines and on vehicles instead of buying American vehicles and engines from American companies, putting Americans to work. Under the previous administration, the federal government contract awarded directly to foreign companies went up 30%. That is going to change on our watch. Today I’m taking the first steps in my larger Build Back Better recovery plan that invests in American workers, unions, and businesses up and down the supply chain. And I know the previous president that’s in our office by promising to buy America and said he would Buy American policy, but here’s why this is different and not the same. I’ll be signing an executive order in just a moment tightening the existing Buy American policies and go further. We’re setting clear directives and clear explanations. We’re going to go to the core issue with a centralized, coordinated effort. Look, today I’m creating a director of Made in America at the White House Office of Management and Budget, who will oversee our all of government Made in America initiative. That starts with stopping federal agencies from waiving Buy American requirements with impunity has been going on. If an agency wants to issue a waiver to say, “We’re not going to buy an American product as part of this project, we’re going to buy a foreign product.” They have to come to the White House and explain it to us. We’re going to require that waivers be publicly posted. That is if someone was seeking a waiver to build this particular vehicle or facility, and is going to buy the following foreign parts. That waiver, the request where it’s going to be posted. Then we’ll work with small American manufacturers and businesses to give them a shot to raise their hand and say, “Yeah, I can do that here in my shop in my town. It’s about as you heard me say before, I used to have a friend who was a great athlete who said, “You’ve got to know how to know.” These small businesses don’t even know they can compete for making the product that is attempting to be waived and to be able to be bought abroad. And I’m directing the Office of Management and Budget to review waivers to make sure they are only used in very limited circumstances. For example, when there’s an overwhelming national security, humanitarian, or emergency need here in America. This hasn’t happened before. It will happen now. Here’s what else we’re going to be doing. Under the Build Back Better recovery plan, we’ll invest hundreds of billions of dollars in buying American products and materials to modernize our infrastructure and our competitive strength will increase in a competitive world. That means millions of good paying jobs using American-made steel in technology to rebuild our roads, our bridges, our ports, and to make them more climate-resilient, as well as make them able to move faster and cheaper and cleaner to transport American-made goods across the country and around the world making us more competitive. It also means replenishing our stockpiles to enhance our national security. As this pandemic has made clear, we can never again be in a position. We have to rely on a foreign country that doesn’t share our interest in order to protect our people during a national emergency. We need to make our own protective equipment, essential products and supplies. And we’ll work with our allies to make sure they have resilient supply chains as well. We’ll also make historic investments in research and development, hundreds of billions of dollars to sharpen America’s innovative edge in markets where global leadership is up for grabs. Markets like battery technology, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, clean energy. The federal government also owns an enormous fleet of vehicles, which we’re going to replace with clean electric vehicles made right here in America by American workers, creating millions of jobs, a million auto worker jobs, and clean energy, and vehicles that are net zero emissions. And together, this’ll be the largest mobilization of public investment in procurement infrastructure and R&D since World War II. And with the executive order I’ll be signing today will increase Buy American requirements for these kinds of projects and improve the way we measure domestic content requirements. For example, right now, if you manufacture a vehicle for the federal government, you need to show at least 50% of the components of that vehicle were made in America. But because of loopholes that have been expanded over time, you can count the least valuable possible parts as part of that 50% to say made in America. While the most valuable parts, the engines, the steel, the glass are manufactured abroad. But basically we’re batting zero for two. The content threshold of 50% aren’t high enough. And the way we measure the content doesn’t account for US jobs and economic activity. We’re going to change that as well. The executive action I’m signing today will not only require the companies make more of their components in America, but that the value of those components is contributing to our economy, measured by things like a number of American jobs created and/or supported. At the same time, we’ll be committed to working with our trading partners to modernize international trade rules, including those relating to government procurement to make sure we can all use our taxpayer dollars to spur investment that promotes growth and resilient supply chains. And here’s what else the action does. When we buy America, we’ll buy from all of America. That includes communities that have historically been left out of government procurement, black, brown, Native American, small businesses and entrepreneurs in every region of the country. We will use a national network of manufacturers called the Manufacturing Extension Partnership that’s in all 50 States and Puerto Rico to help government agency connect with new domestic suppliers across the country. This is a critical piece of building our economy back better and including everyone in the deal this time, especially small businesses that are badly hurting in this economy. … Small businesses that are badly hurting in this economy. The executive action I’m taking also reiterates my strong support for the Jones Act and American vessels, and our ports, especially those important for America’s clean energy future and the development of offshore, renewable energy. I’ll close with this. The reason we need to do this is America can’t sit on the sidelines in the race for the future. Our competitors aren’t waiting. To ensure the future is made in America, we need to win not just the jobs of today, but the jobs and industries of tomorrow. And we know that the middle-class built this country and we also know unions built the middle class. So let’s invest in them once again. I know we’re ready. Despite all we’re facing, I’ve never been more optimistic about the future of America than I am today. Given even just half a chance, the American people, the American workers has never, ever let the country down. Imagine if we give them a full chance. That’s what we’re going to do. I’ll stop here and sign the executive order and then come back and take some of your questions. This executive order is entitled Ensuring the Future is Made in America By American, All American Workers. There we go and now I’m happy to take your questions. [crosstalk 00:10:49]. Thank you, Mr. President. Jonathan Lemire with the Associated Press. Two topics, if I may. The first, you have made reopening schools a central part of your first 100 days agenda, and you’ve long portrayed yourself as an ally to the teachers and unions. Right now, the Chicago Teachers’ Union has refused, they’ve defied an order to return to in-person classrooms because of a lack of vaccinations. I believe we should make school classrooms safe and secure for the students, for the teachers and for the help that’s in those schools, maintaining the facilities. We need new ventilation systems in those schools. We need testing for people coming in and out of the classes. We need testing for teachers as well as students. And we need the capacity, the capacity to know that in fact, the circumstance in the school is safe and secure for everyone. For example, there’s no reason why the clear guidance will be that every school should be thoroughly sanitized, from the laboratories to the hallways. And so this is about making, and none of the school districts that I’m aware of, there may be some public school districts, have insisted that all those pieces be in place. And I might add it’s the same kind of thing I hope we can do with small businesses and businesses, making sure they have the capacity to test their workers when they come in, to make sure they have plastic dividers in between their booths, in their restaurants, et cetera. To make sure they can sanitize. So it’s not so much about the idea of teachers aren’t going to work. The teachers I know, they want to work. They just want to work in a safe environment and a safe as you can rationally make it. And we can do that. And we should be able to open up every school, kindergarten through eighth grade, if in fact we administer these tests. And it’ll have the added advantage, I might add, of putting millions of people back to work. All those mothers and fathers that are home taking care of their children, rather than go to work, even when they can work. They’re not able to do it unless they have the luxury of working distance wise like many of us do. They’re not able to do it. And so this is about generating economic growth overall as well. Great. Alex from Reuters. Thank you, Mr. President. I’m Alex Alper from Reuters. I wanted to ask a question about Navalny, if you are considering imposing sanctions on any of the individuals involved in his attempted poisoning and/or his arrest when he returned from Germany. And if not, is that related to your concerns about it potentially derailing a New START extension. Thank you. I find that we can both operate in the mutual self-interest of our countries as a New START agreement and make it clear to Russia that we are very concerned about their behavior, whether it’s Navalny, whether it’s the solar winds, or whether it’s reports of bounties on the heads of Americans in Afghanistan, I’ve asked the agencies in question to do a thorough read for me on every one of those issues to update me in precisely where they are. And I will not hesitate to raise those issues with the Russians. Jeff from NBC. [inaudible 00:14:48] A question about your COVID relief deal. On Friday, you said the nation is in a national emergency, we should act like it. Well look, the decision on reconciliation will be one made by the leaders of the House and the Senate, but here’s the deal. I have been doing legislative negotiations for a large part of my life. I know how the system works and I can’t guarantee anything at all, but I can say that what I’m going to be doing and we’ve already begun, is making it clear to the leadership in the House and the Senate, as well as the group of 16, bipartisan group, as well as Republican individuals who have an interest in the issues that are in my package and saying, “Here’s what I’m doing. Here’s why I want to do it. Here’s why I think we need to do it. And what kind of support can or can’t you give to that? “And then we go on to the way in which we deal with legislation all the time. We didn’t have any votes for the recovery package when Barack and I came into office, we were short three votes. We didn’t know we had the votes until the day of bringing it up. But here’s the deal, it’s interesting. And I know you ask a lot of these questions, you know the answers, but you have to help educate the public as well. I’m not suggesting you don’t know what I’m about to say. No one wants to give up on their position until there’s no other alternative. They have to make a decision that they don’t do what, they don’t support what is being proposed, or they insist on what they have, or they let it all go away, fall down. I think we’re far from that point right now, the decision to use reconciliation will depend upon how these negotiations go, and let me make clear about negotiations. I’ve always believed part of negotiation on the part of a president and/or a chairman of a committee trying to get a major piece of legislation passed, is about consultation. It’s not enough for me just to come up to you and say, “I like this. I expect you to support it.” I want to explain to you why I think it’s so important in this package that we have to provide for money for additional vaccines. Why I think it’s so important why we provide for money to extend unemployment benefits. Why I think it’s so important that we provide money to provide for the ability of people not to be thrown out of their apartments during this pandemic, because they can’t afford their rent. … legislation. I don’t expect we’ll know whether we have an agreement or to what extent the entire package will be able to pass or not pass until we get right down to the very end of this process, which will be probably in a couple of weeks. But the point is, this is just the process beginning. Annie from The Washington Post. Thank you so much. Thank you, Mr. President. Annie Linskey with The Washington Post. Hey, Annie. I wanted to ask you a little bit about one of the sort of major themes of your campaign and how you sort of intend to measure and enact it. That is the idea of unity. If you could talk a little bit about what you see unity as being. There are some people who are defining it as being bi-partisan, others are saying it is what most of the people in the country define by some poll might believe or any sort of number. Or perhaps it’s 50 plus one or 50 plus two or 75%. Well, Annie, I think it makes up several of the points you made. One is, unity requires you eliminate the vitriol, make anything that you disagree with about the other person’s personality or their lack of integrity or they’re not decent legislators and the like. We have to get rid of that. I think that’s already beginning to change, but God knows where things go, number one. Unity also is trying to reflect what the majority of the American people, Democrat, Republican, Independent, think is within the fulcrum of what needs to be done to make their lives and the lives of Americans better. For example, if you look at the data, and I’m not claiming the polling data to be exact, but if you look at the data, you have I think it’s, I hope I’m saying it, I guess, you may correct me if I get the number wrong. I think it’s 57%, 58% of the American people including Republicans, Democrats, and independents, think that we have to do something about the COVID vaccine. We have to do something about making sure that people who are be hurting badly, can’t eat, don’t have food are in a position where they’re about to be thrown out of their apartments, et cetera, being able to have an opportunity to get a job, that they all think we should be acting. We should be doing more. Unity also is trying to get, at a minimum, if you pass a piece of legislation that breaks down on party lines, but it gets passed, it doesn’t mean there wasn’t unity. It just means it wasn’t bipartisan. I’d prefer these things to be bipartisan, because I’m trying to generate some consensus and take sort of the, how can I say it, the vitriol out of all of this. Because I’m confident, I’m confident from my discussions. There are a number of Republicans who know we have to do something about food insecurity for people in this pandemic. I’m confident they know we have to do something about figuring out how to get children back in school. There’s easy ways to deal with this. One, if you’re anti-union, you can say, “It’s all because of teachers. Now we’re going to have arguments. For example, I propose that because it was bipartisan, I thought it would increase the prospects of passage, the additional $1,400 in direct cash payment to folks. Well, there’s legitimate reason for people to say, “Do you have the lines drawn the exact right way? Should it go to anybody making over X-number of dollars or Y?” I’m open to negotiate those things. That’s all. I picked it because I thought it was rational, reasonable and it had overwhelming bipartisan support in the House when it passed. But this is all a bit of a moving target in terms of the precision with which this goes. You’re asking about unity, 51 votes, bipartisan, et cetera. The other piece of this is that the one thing that gives me hope that we’re not only going to sort of stay away from the ad hominem attacks on one another, is that there is an overwhelming consensus among the major economists at home and in the world that the way to avoid a deeper, deeper, deeper recession moving in the direction of losing our competitive capacity is to spend money now. From across the board, every major institution has said, “If we don’t invest now, we’re going to lose so much altitude in terms of our employment base and our economic growth it’s going to be harder to re-establish it. We can afford to do it now. As a matter of fact, I think the response has been, “We can’t afford not to invest now. We can’t afford to fail to invest now.” I think there’s a growing realization of that on the part of all, but some very, very hard-edged partisans, maybe on both sides. But I think there is a growing consensus, whether we get it all done exactly the way I want it remains to be seen, but I’m confident that we can work our way through. We have to work our way through. Because as I’ve said 100 times, there is no ability in a democracy for it to function without the ability to reach consensus. Otherwise, it just becomes executive fiat or battleground issues that get us virtually nowhere. That’s correct. … on almost any issue. Well, that benefits no one. It doesn’t inform anybody. It doesn’t allow the public to make judgments about whose they think is right or wrong. I am optimistic that it may take some time, but over the year, if we treat each other with respect, and we’re going to argue like hell, I’m confident of that. Believe me, I know that. I’ve been there. But I think we can do it in a way that we can get things done for the American people. Great. Last question, Josh from Bloomberg. Josh, they don’t trust you with a mic, huh? I don’t know, man. No. That’s fine. I wouldn’t either. Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate you taking the questions. You mentioned just now that you might know in a couple of weeks. Can I ask whether it’s more important for you to get something passed in a short timeframe like that or would you be willing to wait longer to get more bipartisan support? Might I also ask that one of the pillars is the vaccine funding. Well, I’ll try to answer the three parts of your question as I heard them. One, time is of the essence. Time is of the essence. I must tell you, I’m reluctant to cherry-pick and take out one or two items here and then have to go through it again. Because these all are kind of, they go sort of hand in glove, each of these issues, number one. Number two, we are optimistic that we will have enough vaccine in very short order. As you know, we came in office without knowledge of how much vaccine was being held in advance or available. Now that we’re here, we’ve been around a week or so, we now have that. We’ve gotten commitments from some of the producers that they will, in fact, produce more vaccine in a relatively short period of time and then continue that down the road. I’m quite confident that we will be in a position within the next three weeks or so to be vaccinating people at the range of a million a day or in excess of that. I promise that we would get at least 100 million vaccinations, that’s not people, because sometimes you need more than one shot, the vaccination, but 100 million shots in people’s arms of the vaccine. I think with the grace of God and the goodwill of the neighbor and the creek not rising, and as the old saying goes, I think we may be able to get that to 1.5 million a day, rather than 1 million a day, but we have to meet that goal of a million a day. And everything, points that we’re going to have, A, enough vaccine. B, enough syringes and all the paraphernalia needed to store, keep, inject, move into your arm, the vaccine. Three, a number of vaccinators, people administrating the vaccine, which is not an easy task of those who have those facilities, like the nursing homes and hospitals. They have the people to do it, but they don’t have the capacity to do everyone. And so I think we’re leaning hard on in areas where we produce more vaccinators. We feel confident we can do that. And thirdly, it’s really important that we have the fora, the place, the facility, the circumstance, where people can show up, stand in line, and get their vaccine without having to stand in line for eight hours. Being able to pick up the phone, call the pharmacy, and get your name on the list, et cetera. All those mechanical things are really, they sound simple, but they’re all consequential, when we’re trying to get out a minimum of a 100 million vaccinations in the 100 days, and move in the direction where we are well beyond that in the next 100 days, so we can get to the point where we reach herd immunity in a country of over 300 million people. Does that answer your question. I think it will be this spring. I think we’ll be able to do that this spring. But it’s going to be a logistical challenge that exceeds anything we’ve ever tried in this country. But I think we can do that. I feel confident that by summer, we’re going to be well on our way to heading toward herd immunity and increasing the access for people who aren’t first on the list, all the way going down to children, and how we deal with that. But I feel good about where we’re going, and I think we can get it done. Thank you, guys. [crosstalk 00:29:10]. One more on vaccine. Mr. President, one more on vaccine. Now, wait, wait. I know he always asks me tough questions, and he always has an edge to them, but I like him anyway. So go ahead and ask the question. Thank you, Mr. President. No, I think we’ll get there before that. I misspoke. I hope we’ll be able to increase as we go along until we get to the million five a day. That’s my hope. And then, the followup to that would be, now that you’re President and you’re saying there is nothing we can do to change the trajectory of the pandemic in the next several months, what happened to two months ago when you were talking declaratively about, “I’m going to shut down the virus. Well, I’m going to shut down the virus, but I never said I’d do it in two months. I said it took a long time to get here. It’s going to take a long time to beat it. And so we have millions of people out there who have the virus. We’re just, for the first day, I think… Correct me if I’m wrong, I’ve been doing other things this morning, speaking with foreign leaders. But one of the things I think this is one of the first days that the numbers actually come down, the number of deaths, and the number on a daily basis, and the number of hospitalizations, et cetera. It’s going to take time. It’s going to take a heck of a lot of time. And we still have, as Dr. Fauci constantly points out, it’s one thing when we have mass… How can I say it politely? Mass disregard of the warnings about not wearing masks and wearing masks and social distancing and failure to social distance, and people getting together on holidays in ways that weren’t recommended, et cetera. We see first thing that happens is we see the number of infections go up. Then you see the hospitalizations go up. Then you see the deaths go up. And so we’re in this for a while. What are we now? At about 410,000 deaths? And there’s going to be more. The prediction, as I said, from the very beginning to getting here after being sworn in, was the predictions were, we’re going to see somewhere between a total of 600,000 and 660,000 deaths before we began to turn the corner in a major way. And again, remember, the vaccine, most of the people taking the vaccine, a vast, significant number, require two shots, and they’re average of three weeks apart. And it takes time for it to be sure that you get to that 95% assurance rate. And so it’s beginning to move, but I’m confident we will beat this. We will beat this, but we’re still going to be talking about this in the summer. We’re still going to be dealing with this issue in the early fall. And last point I’ll make, and I know you’re tired of hearing me saying it, particularly, you may be tired of me saying it. And that is that if we wear masks between now and the end of April, the experts tell us we can save 50,000 lives. 50,000 people otherwise would die. Thank you so very much. [crosstalk 00:32:32]. Thank you. Hey, guys. We’re going to head back."
"14","01-26-21"," Good afternoon folks. I thank the vice-president for being with me today as well. In my campaign for president, I made it very clear, that the moment it arrived as a nation, where we faced deep racial inequities in America and systemic racism that has plagued our nation for far, far too long. I said that over the course of the past year that the blinders have been taken off the nation, the American people. What many Americans didn’t see or had simply refused to see couldn’t be ignored any longer. Those eight minutes and 46 seconds that took George Floyd’s life opened the eyes of millions of Americans and millions of people around all over the world. It was the knee on the neck of justice, and it wouldn’t be forgotten. It stirred the conscious and tens of millions of Americans. And in my view, it marked a turning point in this country’s attitude toward racial justice. When the six year old daughter, Giana, who I met with when I met with the family, I leaned down to say hi to her. And she looked at me. She said, “Daddy changed the world.” That’s what Giana said, his daughter, “Daddy changed the world.” And I believe she was right, not because this kind of injustice stopped. It clearly hasn’t. But because the ground has shifted, because it changed minds and mindsets. Because it laid the groundwork for progress. COVID-19 has further ripped a path of destruction through every community in America, but no one has been spared. But the devastation in communities of color has been nothing short of stunning. Just look at the numbers. 40% of frontline workers, nurses, first responders, grocery store workers are Americans of color and many are still living on the edge. One in 10 black Americans is out of work today. One in 11 Latino Americans is out of work today. One in seven households in America, about one in four black and one in five Latino households in America, report that they don’t have enough food to eat in the United States of America. Black and Latino Americans are dying of COVID-19 at rates nearly three times that of white Americans. And it’s not White American’s fault, but just a fact. And the Americans now know it, especially younger Americans. One of the reasons I’m so optimistic about this nation is that today’s generation of young Americans is the most progressive, thoughtful, inclusive generation that America has ever seen. And they are pulling us toward justice in so many ways, forcing us to confront the huge gap in economic inequity, between those at the top and everyone else, forcing us to confront the existential crisis of climate. And yes, forcing us to confront systemic racism and white supremacy. It’s just been weeks since all America witnessed a group of thugs, insurrectionists, political extremist and white supremacists violently attack the capital of our democracy. And so now, now’s the time to act. It’s time because that’s what the faith and morality calls us to do. Across nearly every faith, the same principles hold. We’re all God’s children. We should treat each other as we would like to be treated ourselves. And this is time to act and this is time to act because it’s what the core values of this nation calls to do. And I believe the vast majority of Americans, Democrats, Republicans, and independents share these values and want us to act as well. We’ve never fully lived up to the founding principles of this nation, to state the obvious, that all people are created equal and have a right to be treated equally throughout their lives. And it’s time to act now, not only because it’s the right thing to do, but because if we do, we’ll all be better off for it for it. For too long, we’ve allowed a narrow cramped view of the promise of this nation to fester. We’ve bought the view that America is a zero sum game, in many cases. If you succeed, I fail. If you get ahead, I fall behind. If you get the job, I lose mine. Maybe worst of all, if I hold you down, I lift myself up. We’ve lost sight of what President Kennedy told us when he said, “A rising tide lifts all boats.” And when you lift each other up, we’re all lifted up. And the corollary is true as well. When any one of us is held down, we’re all held back. More and more economic studies in recent years have proven this, but I don’t think you need economic studies to see the truth. Just imagine if instead of consigning millions of American children to under-resourced schools, we gave each and every three, four year old child a chance to learn, to go to school. Not daycare, school, and grow and thrive in school. And when they’ve done that, the places that have been done, it shows they have an exponentially greater chance of going all the way through 12 years of school and doing it well. But you know, does anyone in this whole nation think we’re not all better off if that were to happen? Just imagine if instead of denying millions of Americans the ability to own a home and build generational wealth, we made it possible for them to buy a home, their first home, and began to build equity, to provide for their families and send their children off to school. Does anyone doubt that the whole nation would be better off? Just imagine, instead of denying millions of young entrepreneurs the ability to access capital, we made it possible to take their dream to market, create jobs, reinvest in their own communities. Does anyone doubt this whole nation wouldn’t be better off? Just imagine, if more incredibly creative and innovative… how much more creative and innovative we’d be if this nation held the historic black colleges and universities to the same opportunities and minority serving institutions that had the same funding and resources of public universities to compete for jobs and industries of the future. Just ask the first HBCU graduate elected as vice president if that’s not true. But to do this, I believe this nation and this government need to change their whole approach to the issue of racial equity. Yes, we need criminal justice reform, but that isn’t nearly enough. We need to open the promise of America to every American. And that means we need to make the issue of racial equity not just an issue for any one department of government. It has to be the business of a whole of government. That’s why I issued in one of the first days, my whole government executive order that will, for the first time advance, equity for all throughout our federal policies and institutions. It focuses on the full range of communities who have been long underserved and overlooked, people of color, Americans with disabilities, LGBTQ Americans, religious minorities, rural urban, suburban communities facing persistent poverty. I’ve asked Ambassador Susan Rice to lead the administrations charge through the White House and Domestic Policy Council, because I know she’ll see it through. Every White House component and every agency will be involved in this work because advancing equity has to be everyone’s job. Today, I’ll be shortly signing an additional package of executive actions to continue this vital work. Housing, for example. Housing is a right in American and home ownership is an essential tool to wealth creation and to be passed down to generations. Today, I’m directly in the Department of Housing and Urban Affairs and Urban Development to redress historical racism and federal housing policies. Today, I’m directing the federal agency to reinvigorate the consultation process with Indian tribes. Respect for tribal sovereignty would be a cornerstone around engaging with Native American communities. This builds on the work we did last week to expand tribes access to the strategic national stockpile for the first time, to ensure they receive help from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, to fight this pandemic. Today, I’m directing federal agencies to combat the surges of xenophobia, particularly against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, that we’ve seen skyrocket during this pandemic. This is unacceptable. And it’s un-American. I’ve asked the Department of Justice to strengthen his partnership with the Asian American and Pacific Islander community to prevent those hate crimes. I’ve also asked the Department of Health and Human Services to put out best practices for combating xenophobia in our national response to COVID. Look, in the weeks ahead, I’ll be reaffirming the federal government’s commitment to diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility, building on the work we started in the Obama Biden administration. That’s why I’m rescinding the previous administration’s harmful ban on diversity and sensitivity training and abolished the offensive counterfactual 1776 commission. Unity and healing must begin with understanding the truth, not ignorance and lies. Today, I’m also issuing an executive order that will ultimately end the Justice department’s use of private prisons, an industry that houses pretrial detainees and federal prisoners. The executive order directs the attorney general to decline to renew contracts with privately operated criminal facilities, a step we started to take at the end of the Obama administration and was reversed under the previous administration. This is the first step to stop corporations from profiting off incarceration that is less humane and less safe as the studies show. And it is just the beginning of my administration’s plan to address systemic problems in our criminal justice system. Here’s another thing we need to do. We need to restore and expand the Voting Rights Act, named after our dear friend, John Lewis, and continue to fight back against laws that many states are engaged in to suppress the right to vote, while expanding access to the ballot box for all eligible voters. Because here’s the deal. And I’ll close with this. I ran for president because I believe we’re in a battle for the soul of this nation. And the simple truth is our soul will be troubled as long as systemic racism is allowed to persist. We can’t eliminate… It’s not going to be overnight. We can’t eliminate everything, but it’s corrosive. It’s destructive. And it’s costly. It cost every American, not just who felt the sting of racial injustice. We are not just a nation of morally deprived because of systemic racism. We’re also less prosperous. We’re less successful, less secure. We must change. And I know it’s going to take time, but I know we can do it. And I firmly believe the nation is ready to change, but government has to change as well. We need to make equity and justice part of what we do every day, today, tomorrow, and every day, I’m going to sign these executive actions to continue the work, to make real the promise of America for every American. Again, I’m not promising we can end it tomorrow, but I promise you, we’re going to continue to make progress to eliminate systemic racism in every branch of the White House and the federal government is going to be part of that effort. Thank you. This first executive order is a memorandum for the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to readdress our nations and the federal government’s history of discriminatory housing practices and policies. Next executive order is reforming the incarceration system by eliminating the use of privately operated criminal detention facilities. The third executive order is a memorandum for the heads of executive departments and agencies, tribal consultation to serve [inaudible 00:16:23] nation relationships. The last executive order is condemning and combating racism, xenophobia, and intolerance against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the United States. I think the country’s ready. And I know this administration is. Thank you. Mr. President, let’s talk about [inaudible 00:17:05]. You [inaudible 00:17:09]."
"15","01-27-21"," All right. Sir. Good afternoon, everybody. I know the press has just had a long session with the team here about what I’m talking about today and this afternoon. And let me just start by saying I can’t tell you how much I appreciate the three people standing next to me here for what they’ve agreed to do to help. Particularly my best buddy, John Kerry, asking a former secretary of state to come back and do this. And it’s been, as I know, it was a big ask on the part of myself. I was going to blame Kamala for it as well, but for both of us, but John’s been deeply involved. The secretary’s been deeply involved in climate issues as a Senator and one of the leaders of the legislators as well. And I don’t think anybody knows more about the issue and the damage that’s been done by some of the executive orders of the previous administration and Jean you’ve run everything Jean, thank you very much. Let me get to it. Today is climate day at the White House, which means that today is job’s day at the White House. We’re talking about American innovation, American products, American labor, and we’re talking about the health of our families and cleaner water, cleaner air, and cleaner communities. We’re talking about national security, America leading the world in a clean energy future. It’s a future of enormous hope and opportunity. It’s about coming to the moment to deal with this maximum threat that’s now facing us, climate change, with a greater sense of urgency. In my view, we’ve already waited too long to deal with this climate crisis and we can’t wait any longer. We see it with our own eyes, we feel it, we know it in our bones and it’s time to act. And I might speak parenthetically, if you notice the attitude of the American people toward greater impetus on focusing on climate change and doing something about it has increased across the board, Democrat, Republican, independent. That’s why I’m signing today an executive order to supercharge our administration’s ambitious plan to confront the existential threat of climate change, it is an existential threat. Last year, wildfires burned more than 5,000 acres in the West, as no one knows better than the vice-president, former Senator from California. An area roughly the size of the entire state of New Jersey. More intense and powerful hurricanes and tropical storms pummeled states across the Gulf Coast and along the East coast. I can testify to that from Delaware. Historic floods, severe droughts have ravaged the Midwest. More American see and feel the devastation in big cities, small towns, coastlines, and in farmlands in red States and in blue States. And the defense department reported that climate change is a direct threat to more than two thirds of the military’s operational critical installations, two thirds. And so this could well be on the conservative side. And many climate and health calamities are colliding all at once. It’s not just the pandemic that keeps people inside, it’s poor air quality. Multiple studies have shown that air pollution is associated with an increased risk of death from COVID-19. And just like we need a unified national response to COVID-19, we desperately need a unified national response to the climate crisis because there is a climate crisis. We must lead global response because neither challenge can be met, as Secretary Kerry has pointed out many times, by the United States alone. We know what to do. We’ve just got to do it. When we think of climate change, we think of it, this is a case where conscious and convenience cross paths. We’re dealing with this existential threat to the planet and increasing our economic growth and prosperity are one in the same. When I think of climate change and the answers to it, I think of jobs. A key plank of our build back better recovery plan is building a modern resilient climate infrastructure and clean energy future that will create millions of good paying union jobs, not seven, eight, 10, $12 an hour, but prevailing wage and benefits. We can put millions of Americans to work modernizing our water systems, transportation, our energy infrastructure to withstand the impacts of extreme climate. We’ve already reached a point where we’re going to have to live with what it is now. That’s going to require a lot of work all by itself, without it getting any worse. We think of renewable energy, we see American manufacturing, American workers racing to lead the global market. We see farmers making American agriculture first in the world to achieve net zero emissions and gaining new sources of income in the process. And I want to parenthetically thank the secretary of agriculture for helping to put together that program during the campaign. We see small business and master electricians designing, installing, and innovating energy conserving technologies and building homes and buildings. And we’re going to reduce electric consumption to save hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in energy costs in the process. And when the previous administration reversed the Obama Biden vehicle standard and picked big oil companies over American workers, the Biden Harris administration will not only bring those standards back, we’ll set new ambitious ones that our workers are ready to meet. We see these workers building new buildings, installing 500,000 new electric vehicle charging stations across the country as we modernize our highway system to adapt to the changes that have already taken place. We see American consumers switching to electric vehicles through rebates and incentives and the residents of our cities and towns breathing cleaner air and fewer kids living with asthma and dying from it. And not only that, the federal government owns and maintains an enormous fleet of vehicles, as you all know. With today’s executive order, combined with the Buy American executive order I signed on Monday, we’re going to harness the purchasing power of the federal government to buy clean zero emission vehicles that are made and sourced by union workers right here in America. With everything I just mentioned, this’ll mean 1 million new jobs in the American automobile industry, 1 million. And we’ll do another thing. We’ll take steps towards my goal of achieving 100% carbon pollution free electric sector by 2035, transforming the American electric sector to produce power without carbon pollution will be a tremendous spur of job creation and economic competitiveness in the 21st century, not to mention the benefits to our health and to our environment. Already 84% of all new electric capacity planned to come onto the electric grid this year is clean energy, clean energy. Why? Because it’s affordable, because it’s clean, because in many cases it’s cheaper, and they’re keeping up. We’re going to need scientists, the national labs, land grant universities, historical black colleges and universities to innovate the technologies needed to generate, store, and transmit clean electricity across distances and battery technology and a whole range of other things. We need engineers to design them and workers to manufacture them. We need iron workers and welders to install them. Technologies they invent, design, and build will ultimately become cheaper than any other kind of energy, helping us dramatically expand our economy and create more jobs with a cleaner, cleaner environment. And we’ll become the world’s largest exporter of those technologies, creating even more jobs. I’m going to build 1.5 million new energy efficient homes and public housing units that are going to benefit communities three times over. One, by alleviating the affordable housing crisis, two, by increasing energy efficiency, and three, by reducing the racial wealth gap linked to home ownership. We’re also going to create more than a quarter million jobs to do things like plug the millions of abandoned oil and gas wells that pose an ongoing threat to the health and safety of our communities. There are abandoned wells. They’re open now, and we’re going to put people to work. They’re not going to lose jobs in these areas, we’re going to create jobs. They’re going to be here prevailing wage to cap those over a million wells. These aren’t pie in the sky dreams. These are concrete, actionable solutions, and we know how to do this. The Obama Biden administration rescued the auto industry and helped them retool. We need solar energy, cost competitive with traditional energy. Weatherizing more we made it become cost competitive, weatherizing more than a million homes. The recovery act of the democratic administration made record clean energy investments, $90 billion, the president had asked me to make sure how that money was spent on everything from smart grid systems to clean energy manufacturing. Now the Biden Harris administration is going to do it again and go beyond. The executive order I’ll be signing to established a White House office of domestic climate policy. And it’ll be led by one of America’s most distinguished climate leaders, former EPA director, Gina McCarthy. As the head of the new office and my national climate advisor, Gina will chair the national climate task force made up of many members of our cabinet to deliver a whole government approach to the climate crisis. It’s not time for small measures. We need to be bold. So let me be clear, that includes helping revitalizing the economies of coal, oil, and gas and power plant communities. We have to start by creating new good paying jobs, capping those abandoned wells, reclaiming mines, turning old brownfield sites in the new hubs of economic growth, creating new good paying jobs in those communities where those workers live because they helped build this country. We’re never going to forget the men and women who dug the coal and built the nation. We’re going to do right by them. Make sure they have opportunities to keep building the nation in their own communities and getting paid well for it. While the whole of government approach is necessary, though, it’s not sufficient. We’re going to work with mayors and governors and tribal leaders and businesses leaders who are stepping up and the young people organizing and leading the way. My message to those young people is you have the full capacity and power of the federal government. Your government is going to work with you. Now today’s executive order also directs the secretary of the interior to stop issuing new oil and gas leases on public lands and offshore waters, wherever possible. We’re going to review and reset the oil and gas leasing program. Like the previous administration, we’ll start to properly manage… Unlike it, we’re going to start to properly manage lands and waterways in ways that allow us to protect, preserve them, the full value that they provide for us for future generations. Let me be clear, and I know this always comes up. We’re not going to ban fracking. We’ll protect jobs and grow jobs, including through stronger standards like controls from methane leaks and union workers willing to install the changes. Unlike previous administrations, I don’t think the federal government should give handouts to big oil to the tune of $40 billion in fossil fuel subsidies. And I’m going to be going to the Congress asking them to eliminate those subsidies. We’re going to take money and invest it in clean energy jobs in America, millions of jobs in wind solar and carbon capture. In fact, today’s action is going to help us increase renewable energy production from offshore wind and meet our obligation to be good stewards of our public lands. It establishes a new modern day civilian climate corp that I called for when I was campaigning, to heal our public lands and make us less vulnerable to wildfires and floods. Look, this executive order I’m signing today also makes it official that climate change will be the center of our national security and foreign policy. Secretary Kerry, as our special presidential onboard for climate, with him, the world knows how serious I am by appointing one of America’s most distinguished statesman, and one of my closest friends speaking for America, in one of the most pressing threats of our time. John was instrumental in negotiating the Paris climate agreement that this administration rejoined on day one, as I promised, and today’s executive order strengthen that commitment by working with other nations to support the most vulnerable to the impact of climate change and to increase our collective resilience. That includes a summit of world leaders that I’ll convene to address this climate crisis on earth day, this year. In order to establish a new effort to integrate the security implications of climate change as part of our national security risk assessment and analysis will also so be included. With this executive order, environmental justice will be at the center of all we do, addressing the disproportionate health and environmental and economic impacts on communities of color, so-called fence line communities, especially those communities, Brown, Black, Native American, poor whites. It’s hard, the hard hit areas like Cancer Alley in Louisiana, or the Route Nine Carter in the state of Delaware. That’s why we’re going to work to make sure that they receive 40% of the benefits of key federal investments in clean energy, clean water, and wastewater infrastructure. Lifting up these communities makes us all stronger as a nation and increases the health of everybody. Finally, as with our fight against COVID-19, we will listen to the science and protect the integrity of our federal response to the climate crisis. Earlier this month, I nominated Dr. Eric Lander, a brilliant scientist who is here today to be the director of the office of science and technology. I also nominated another brilliant scientist, Dr. Francis Arnold and Dr. Maria Zuber to co-chair the president’s council of advisors on science and technology, so-called PCAST, that president Eisenhower started six weeks after the launch of Sputnik. It’s a team of America’s top scientists charged with asking the most American of questions, what next? What’s the next big breakthrough? And then helping us make the impossible possible. Today, I’m signing a presidential memorandum, making it clear that we will protect our world-class scientists from political interference and ensure they can think, research, and speak freely and directly to me, the vice-president and the American people. To summarize this executive order, it’s about jobs, good paying union jobs. It’s about workers building our economy back better than before. It’s a whole of government approach put climate change at the center of our domestic, national security, and foreign policy. It’s advancing conservation, revitalizing communities in cities and on the farm lands, and securing and environmental justice. Our plans are ambitious, but we are America. We’re bold, we’re unwavering in the pursuit of jobs and innovation, science, and discovery. We can do this. We must do this. And we will do this. I’m now going to sign the executive order to meet the climate crisis with American jobs and American ingenuity. And I want to thank you all. I’m going to go over and sign that now. The first order I’m signing is tackling the climate crisis at home and abroad. This next one to restoring trust in government through science and integrity and evidence-based policymaking. And this last one is the president’s council of advisors on science and technology established. Thank you all for your time. Mr. Sir, after the Republican vote… Do you still support impeachment trial sir? Still supporting impeachment trial sir? Thank you, sir. Guys, do you want to call Angela? We’re going to…"
"16","01-28-21"," Since we are socially distanced, I think I can take my mask off to make this very brief announcement. I know you’ve been briefed by the healthcare team about what this is about, and there’s an easy and quick way for us to describe this. It’s been a busy week and I’ve signed executive orders tackling COVID-19, economic and climate crises, as well as advancing racial equity. But today I’m about to sign two executive orders, basically the best way to describe them, to undo the damage Trump has done. There’s nothing new that we’re doing here other than restoring the affordable care act and restoring the Medicaid to the way it was before Trump became president, which by [inaudible 00:00:00:49], he changed, made more inaccessible or expensive and more difficult for people to qualify for either of those two items, the affordable care act or Medicaid. And the second order I’m going to be signing also changes what the president has done, the president, the former president has done, and that a memorandum reversed my predecessor’s attack on women’s health, excuse me, health access and as we continue to battle COVID-19, even more critical Americans have meaningful access to healthcare. And so that’s what I’m about to do, and again, I’m not initiating any new law, any new aspects of the law. This is going back to what the situation was prior to the president’s executive orders. And the first one I’m going to be signing here is to strengthen Medicaid and the affordable care act and of all times that we need to reinstate access to affordability of and extent of access to Medicaid is now, in the middle of this COVID crisis. And the second order I’m signing relates to protecting women’s health at home and abroad and it reinstates the changes that were made in Title 10 and other things, making it harder for women to have access to affordable health care as it relates to their reproductive rights."
"17","01-29-21"," … accelerating. 900,000 more Americans filed for unemployment insurance in this week alone. 30 million Americans don’t have enough food to eat this week. And interest rates are at historic lows. And the return on smart investments in the economy have never been higher. And it’s not just me saying this. As, I said, it’s a consensus among the vast majority leader economists in the country, as I said, the left, right and center, including advisers to former President Trump and George W. Bush. And so I’ve been meeting all morning with other folks as well. The notion here is we would have to act now. There’s no time for any delay. And so we could end up with 4 million fewer jobs this year, according to Moody’s Wall Street firm. And it could take a year longer to return to full employment if we don’t act and don’t act now. We could see an entire cohort of kids with a lower lifetime earnings because they’re deprived of another semester of school. Millions of parents, and maybe some of you, millions of parents, particularly moms are forced to stay home, reducing the family wages. And if they’re a single wage earner, it’s really difficult on future job prospects, that they have no choice, but to stay home and take care of their children. Millions of people are out of work, unemployed. The future of millions that are held back for no good reason other than our failure to act. So the choice couldn’t be clearer. We have learned from past crises, the risk is not doing too much, the risk is not doing enough. And this is the time to act now. I’ve asked Secretary Yellen who’s been leading this effort, to come in and we’re going to go into some detail among ourselves. But I think she has a statement to make as well. Thank you very much, Mr. President. Well, there is a huge amount of pain in our economy right now, and it was evident in the data released yesterday. Over a million people applied for unemployment insurance last week. And that’s far more than in the worst week of the Great Recession. And economists agree that if there’s not more help, many more people will lose their small businesses, the roofs over their heads, and the ability to feed their families. And we need to help those people before the virus is brought under control. The President’s American Rescue Plan will help millions of people make it to the other side of this pandemic. And it will also make some smart investments to get our economy back on track. I want to emphasize the president is absolutely right. The price of doing nothing is much higher than the price of doing something and doing something big. We need to act now. And the benefits of acting now and acting big will far outweigh the costs in the long run. Thank you. [crosstalk 00:03:30]. Mr. President, what do you think of the Johnson and Johnson results. Let’s go, thank you, guys. Thank you. I’m waiting to hear from the team on the detail of it. I saw the news reported this morning. I haven’t had a chance to speak with Dr. Fauci. [inaudible 00:03:39]. One point I want to make that the secretary made. Let’s get this straight. It’s not only that people will be badly, badly hurt if we don’t pass this package, in terms of increased rate of death, in terms of poverty, a whole range of things, but we will also be hurt long-term economically, economically. We need to make these investments so the economy can grow remainder of this year and next year. The investments now will help the economy grow. It will not, in fact, put a drag on the economy of spending this money. It will do the exact opposite. So thank you all very much. Thank you, guys. Let’s go. Thank you. Let’s go. Thank you. Thank you. Come on, you guys. Thank you. Thank you. Come guys, let’s go. Let’s go. Thank you. Let’s go. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."
"18","02-02-21"," Well, let me begin by saying that all three of us, the Vice President, the new Secretary of Homeland Security, that our hearts go out to the families of the FBI special agents, two of whom were killed and three of whom were injured today in Florida. I was briefed on this tragedy earlier today, and I know the FBI has gathered information about how this happened, what happened, but I can only imagine how these families are feeling today. One of the things when you are in a combat zone in the military or you’re an FBI agent or a police officer, every family just when they put that shield on and go out in the morning dreads the possibility of a call, receiving that phone call. My heart aches for the families. I’ve not had an opportunity, nor will I try today to contact them, but they put their lives on the line, and it’s a hell of a price to pay. Every single day, every time these folks get up, by and large, the vast, vast majority of these men and women are decent, honorable people who put themselves on the line. We owe them. But the purpose of my asking you here today is I want to congratulate the new secretary. Secretary Mayorkas is going to take on an easy job. Nothing to it, Homeland Security, and going to deal. Looking forward to his leadership and working with Congress on a lot of issues, including an immigration bill that has, I think, great support in both chambers. Today, I’m going to sign a few executive orders to strengthen the immigration system, building on the executive actions I took on day one to protect Dreamers and the Muslim ban and to better manage our borders, and that’s what these three different executive orders are about. I want to make it clear. There’s a lot of talk with good reason about the number of executive orders that I have signed. I’m not making new law, I’m eliminating bad policy. What I’m doing is taking on the issues, 99% of them, that the last president of United States issued executive orders I thought were very counterproductive to our security, counterproductive to who we are as a country, particularly in the area of immigration. This is about how America’s safer, stronger, more prosperous when we have a fair, orderly and humane legal immigration system. And with the first action today, we’re going to work to undo the moral and national shame of the previous administration that literally, not figuratively, ripped children from the arms of their families, their mothers and fathers at the border, and with no plan, none whatsoever, to reunify the children who were still in custody and their parents. The second action addresses the root causes of our migration to our southern border, and the third action. The third order I’m going to be signing orders a full review of the previous administration’s harmful and counterproductive immigration policies basically across the board. And so with that, I’m going to sign the first order, which is a re-establishment of the NRACC task taskforce and our reunification of families. It removes the stain on our reputation for what those separations caused. That is the first order. The second order I’m signing is creating a comprehensive regional framework to address the causes of migration and to managed migration throughout the North and Central America, and to provide a safe and orderly processing of asylum seekers at the United States border. And the third order I’m signing is restoring the faith in our legal immigration system and strengthening immigration and inclusion efforts for new Americans. As my grandfather would say, the grace of God and the goodwill of neighbors will reunite these children and re-establish our reputation as be a haven for people in need. Thank you very, very much. Thank you, [crosstalk 00:07:31]. Mr. President, what’s your message to these families that have been separated. Thank you. Thank you. [inaudible 00:07:31]. Sir, Mr. President. Thank you. Thank you, let’s go. Thank you. What was the action about that you [inaudible 00:07:46], Mr. President. Thank you. Thank you. We’ll have plenty of time to talk about it. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you, guys."
"19","02-04-21"," Mr. Secretary, it’s great to be here with you. And been looking forward a long time to be able to call you Mr. Secretary. Good afternoon, everyone. It’s an honor to be back in the State Department under the eyes of the first American chief diplomat, Benjamin Franklin. And by the way, I want you all to know that the press was Benjamin Franklin professor of presidential politics at Penn and I thought they did that because I was as old as he was but I guess not. Anyway, all kidding aside, it’s great to be here and stand alongside our most recent senior diplomat, secretary Tony Blinken. Mr. Secretary thank you for welcoming us today. We’ve worked together for over 20 years, your diplomatic skills are respected equally by your friends and our competitors around the world. And they know when you speak, you speak for me. And so, is the message I want the world to hear today. America is back. America is back. Diplomacy is back at the center of our foreign policy. As I said, in my inaugural address, we will repair our alliances, engage with the world once again, not to meet yesterday’s challenges, but today’s, and tomorrow’s. American leadership must meet this new moment of advancing authoritarianism, including the growing ambitions of China to rival the United States and the determination of Russia to damage and disrupt our democracy. We must meet the new moment, accelerating global challenges. From the pandemic to the climate crisis, to nuclear proliferation, challenging the will only to be solved by nations working together and in common, we can’t do it alone. We must start with diplomacy, rooted in America’s most cherished democratic values. Defending freedom, championing opportunity, upholding universal rights, respecting the rule of law and treating every person with dignity. That’s the grounding wire of our global policy, our global power. That’s our inexhaustible source of strength. That’s America’s abiding advantage. Though many of these values have come under intense pressure in recent years, even pushed to the brink in the last few weeks, the American people are going to emerge from this moment stronger, more determined and better equipped to unite the world in fighting to defend democracy because we have fought for it ourselves. Over the past few days, we’ve been in close cooperation with our allies and partners to bring together the international community to address the military coop in Berma. I’ve also been in touch with leader McConnell to discuss our shared concerns about the situation in Berma And we are United in our resolve. There can be no doubt, in a democracy, force should never seek to overrule the will of the people or attempt to erase the outcome of a credible election. The Burmese military should relinquish power they have seized, release the advocates and activist and officials they had detained, lift the restrictions on telecommunications and refrain from violence. As I said earlier this week, we will work with our partners to support restoration of democracy and the rule of law and impose consequences on those responsible. Over the past two weeks, I have spoken with the leaders of many of our closest friends, Canada, Mexico, the UK, Germany, France, NATO, Japan, South Korea, Australia, to be reforming the habits of cooperation and rebuilding the muscle of democratic alliance that have atrophied over the past few years of neglect and I would argue abuse. American alliances are our greatest asset. And leading with diplomacy means standing shoulder to shoulder with our allies and key partners once again. By leading with diplomacy, we must also mean engaging our adversaries and our competitors diplomatically, where it’s in our interest and advance the security of the American people. That’s why yesterday the United States and Russia agreed to extend the new START treaty for five years to preserve the only remaining treaty between our countries, safeguarding nuclear stability. At the same time, I made it clear to President Putin in a manner very different from my predecessor, that the days of the United States rolling over in the face of Russia’s’ aggressive actions, interfering with our elections, cyber attacks, poisoning its citizens are over. We will not hesitate to raise the cost on Russia and defend our vital interest in our people. And we will be more effective in dealing with Russia when we work in coalition and coordination with other like-minded partners. The politically motivated jailing Alexei Navalny and the Russian efforts to suppress freedom of expression and peaceful assembly are a matter of deep concern to us and the international community. Mr. Navalny like all Russian citizens is entitled to his rights under the Russian constitution. He’s been targeted, targeted for exposing corruption. He should be released immediately and without condition and we’ll also take on directly the challenges posed by our prosperity, security and democratic values by our most serious competitor, China. We’ll confront China’s economic abuses, counter its aggressive course of action to push back on China’s attack on human rights, intellectual property and global governance. But we are ready to work with Beijing when it’s in America’s interest to do so. We will compete from a position of strength by building back better at home, working with our allies and partners, renewing our role in international institutions and reclaiming our credibility and moral authority, much of which has been lost. That’s why we moved quickly to begin restoring American engagement internationally and earn back our leadership position to catalyze global action on shared challenges. On day one, I signed the paperwork to rejoin the Paris climate agreement. We’re taking steps led by an example of integrating climate objectives across all of our diplomacy and raising the ambition of our climate targets. That way we can challenge other nations, other major emitters to up the ante on their own commitments. I’ll be hosting a climate leaders summit to address the climate crisis on Earth Day of this year. America must lead in the face of this existential threat, and just as with the pandemic, it requires global cooperation. We’ve also re-engaged with the World Health Organization, that way we can build better global preparedness to counter COVID-19 as well as detect and prevent future pandemics, because there will be more. We’ve elevated the status of cyber issues within our government, including appointing a first deputy national security advisor for cyber and emerging technology. We’re launching an urgent initiative to improve our capability, readiness and resilience in cyberspace. Today, I’m announcing additional steps to course correct our foreign policy and better unite our democratic values with our diplomatic leadership. To begin, defense secretary Austin will be leading a global posture review of our forces so that our military footprint is appropriately aligned with our foreign policy and national security priorities. It will be coordinated across all elements of our national security. With secretary Austin and Secretary Blinken working in close cooperation. And while this review is taking place, we’ll be stopping any plan, troop withdraw from Germany. We’re also stepping up our diplomacy to end the war in Yemen, a war which has created humanitarian and strategic catastrophe. I’ve asked my Middle East team to ensure our support for the United nations led initiative to impose a cease fire, open humanitarian challenges and restore long dormant peace talks. This morning, secretary Blinken appointed Tim Lenderking, a career foreign policy officer as our special envoy to the Yemen conflict and I appreciate him doing this. Tim has lifelong experience in the region and had worked with the UN envoy and all parties of the conflict to push for a diplomatic resolution. And Tim’s diplomacy will be bolstered by USAID working to ensure that humanitarian aid is reaching the Yemeni people who are suffering unendurable devastation. This war has to end and to underscore our commitment, we’re ending all American support for offensive operations in the war in Yemen, including relevant arm sales. At the same time, Saudi Arabia faces missile attacks, UAV strikes, and other threats from Iranian supplied forces in multiple countries. We’re going to continue to support and help Saudi Arabia defend its sovereignty, and it’s territorial integrity and its people. We also face a crisis of more than 80 million displaced people suffering all around the world. The United States’ moral leadership on refugee issues was a point of bipartisan consensus for so many decades when I first got here. We shine the light of Liberty on oppressed people. We offered safe havens for those fleeing violence or persecution, and our example pushed other nations to open wide their doors as well. So today, I’m approving an executive order to begin the hard work of restoring our refugee admissions program to help meet the unprecedented global need. It’s going to take time to rebuild what has been so badly damaged, but that’s precisely what we’re going to do. This executive order will position us to be able to raise the refugee admissions back up to 125,000 persons for the first full fiscal year of the Biden Harris administration and I’m directing the state department to consult with Congress about making a down payment on that commitment as soon as possible. And to further impair our moral leadership, I’m also issuing a Presidential memo to agencies to reinvigorate our leadership on the LGBTQI issues and do it internationally. We’ll ensure diplomacy and foreign assistance are working to promote the rights of those individuals included by combating criminalization and protecting the LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers. Finally, to successfully reassert our diplomacy and keep Americans safe, prosperous, and free, we must restore the health morale of our foreign policy institutions. I want the people who work in this building and our embassies and councils around the world to know I value your expertise and I respect you and I will have your back. This administration is going to empower you to do your jobs, not target or politicize you. We want a rigorous debate that brings all perspectives and makes room for dissent. That’s how we’ll get the best possible policy outcomes. So with your help, the United States will again, lead, not just by the example of our power, but the power of our example. That’s why my administration has already taken the important step to live our democratic values at home. Within hours of taking office, I signed the executive order, overturning the hateful discriminatory Muslim ban. Reversed the ban on transgender individuals serving in our military. And as part of our commitment to truth, transparency and accountability, we stated on day one, we started on day one with daily briefings of the press from the White House. We’ve re-instituted regular briefings here at State and at the Pentagon. We believe free press isn’t an adversary, rather it’s essential, free press is essential to the health of a democracy. We’ve restored our commitment to science and to create policies grounded in facts and evidence. I suspect Ben Franklin would approve. We’ve taken steps to acknowledge and address systemic racism and the scourge of white supremacy in our own country. Racial equity will not just be an issue for one department in our administration, it has to be the business of the whole of government and all our federal policies and institutions. All this matters to foreign policy because when we host the summit of democracies early in my administration to rally the nations of the world to defend democracy globally, to push back the authoritarianism’s advance will be a much more credible partner because of these efforts to shore up our own foundations. There’s no longer a bright line between foreign and domestic policy. Every action we take and our conduct abroad you must take with American working families in mind. Advancing a foreign policy for the middle class demands urgent focus on our domestic economic renewal. And that’s why I immediately put forth the American rescue plan to pull us out of this economic crisis. That’s why I signed an executive order strengthening our by American policies last week. That’s also why I’ll work with Congress to make far reaching investments in research and development of transformative technologies. These investments are going to create jobs, maintain America’s competitive edge globally and ensure all Americans share in the dividends. If we invest in ourselves and our people, if we fight to ensure that American businesses are positioned to compete and win on the global stage, if the rules of international trade aren’t stacked against us. If our workers and intellectual property are protected, then there’s no country on earth, not China, any other country on earth that can match us. Investing in our diplomacy isn’t something we do just because it’s the right thing to do for the world. We do it in order to live in peace, security, and prosperity. We do it because it’s in our own naked self interest. When we strengthen our alliances we amplify our power, as well as our ability to disrupt threats before they can reach our shores. When we invest in economic development of countries, we create new markets for our products and reduce the likelihood of instability, violence and mass migrations. When we strengthen health systems in far regions of the world, we reduce the risk of future pandemics that could threaten our people and our economy. When we defend equal rights of people the world over of women and girls, LGBTQ individuals, indigenous communities, and people with disabilities, the people of every ethnic background and religion, we also ensure that those rights are protected for our own children here in America. America cannot afford to be absent any longer on the world stage. I come today to the state department, an agency as old and as [inaudible 00:18:05] as the nation itself because diplomacy has always been essential. Now, America writes his own destiny for the diplomacy of Ben Franklin help to share the success of our revolution, the vision of the Marshall plan help prevent the world from foundering on the wreckage of the war. And the passions of Eleanor Roosevelt that declared the audacious idea of universal rights that belong to all. The leadership of the diplomats of every stripe doing the daily work of engagement created the very idea of a free and interconnected world. We are a country that does big things. American diplomacy makes it happen. And our administration is ready to take up the mantle and lead once again. Thank you all and may God bless you and protect our troops and our diplomats and our development experts and all Americans serving in harm’s way. Going this way. Thank you all."
"20","02-05-21"," Chairpersons of the House of Representatives in the Oval, and it went a little longer, but went very well. Thank you all for being here. I’m accompanied by the vice-president and the secretary of Treasury, Janet Yellen. And I want to talk today about our plan. And the January job numbers came out today. And while we’re grateful for everyone who found work and is earning a paycheck, it’s very clear our economy is still in trouble. We added just 6,000 private sector jobs in the country last month. Overall, we added 49,000 jobs. And this at a time when we have more than 10 million people out of work, 4 million people have been out of work for six months or longer and 2.5 million women have been driven from the workforce. 15 million Americans are behind in their rental payments, 24 million adults and 12 million children literally don’t have enough food to eat. These aren’t Democrats or Republicans, they’re Americans and they’re suffering. They’re suffering not because of anything they did through no fault of their own, they’re suffering. Once in a century virus has decimated our economy and it’s still wrecking havoc on our economy today. And so much of it is still about the virus. We’re still in the teeth of this pandemic. In fact, January was the single deadliest month of the whole pandemic. We lost nearly 100,000 lives. I know some in Congress think we’ve already done enough to deal with the crisis in the country. Others think that things are getting better and we can afford to sit back and either do a little or do nothing at all. That’s not what I see. I see enormous pain in this country. A lot of folks out of work, a lot of folks going hungry, staring at the ceiling tonight wondering what am I going to do tomorrow. A lot of folks trying to figure out how to keep their jobs and take care of their children. A lot of folks reaching the breaking point. Suicides are up, mental health needs are increasing, violence against women and children is increasing. A lot of folks are losing hope. And I believe the American people are looking right now to their government for help to do our job, to not let them down. So I’m going to act and I’m going to act fast. I’d like to be doing it with the support of Republicans. I’ve met with Republicans. There’s some really fine people want to get something done, but they’re just not willing to go as far as I think we have to go. I’ve told both Republicans and Democrats that’s my preference to work together. But if I have to choose between getting help right now to Americans who are hurting so badly and getting bogged down in a lengthy negotiation or compromising on a bill that’s up to the crisis, that’s an easy choice. I’m going to help the American people who are hurting now. That’s why I’m so grateful to the House and the Senate for moving so fast on the American Rescue Plan. Here’s what’s in that plan. First, it puts $160 billion into our national COVID-19 strategy, which includes more money for manufacturing, distribution, and setting up of vaccine sites. Everything that’s needed to get the vaccines into people’s arms. There’s simply nothing more important than us getting the resources that we need to vaccinate the people in this country as soon as quickly as possible. So job number one of the American Rescue Plan is vaccines, vaccines. The second, the American Rescue Plan is going to keep the commitment of $2,000. 600 has already gone out, $1,400 checks to people who need it. This is money directly in people’s pockets. They need it, we need to target that money so folks making $300,000 don’t get any windfall. But if you’re a family that’s a two or a wage earner, each of the parents, one making 30 grand, one making 40 or 50, maybe that’s a little more than, well, they need the money and they’re going to get it. And here’s what I won’t do. I’m not cutting the size of the checks. They’re going to be $1,400, period. That’s what the American people were promised. Very quickly, here’s the rest of my plan. It has money for food and nutrition so that folks don’t go hungry. I think our Republican friends are going to support that. It extends unemployment insurance, which is going to run out on March 13th of this year to the end of September of this year, because we’re still going to have high unemployment. It helps small businesses thousands of whom have had to go out of business. It has money to help folks pay their health insurance. It has rental assistance to keep people in their homes rather than being thrown out in the street. It’s got money to help us open our schools safely. And there’s money for childcare, for paid leave. It gets needed resources to state and local governments to prevent layoffs of essential personnel, firefighters, nurses, folks who are school teachers, sanitation workers. It raises minimum wage. It’s big and it’s bold and it’s a real answer to the crisis we’re in. That’s one more thing. And I want to say it very clearly on this, just be very clear in this point, it’s better economics. It not only addresses the immediate crisis we’re in, it’s better for the long-term economic health of our nation and our competitiveness. My plan creates more jobs, creates more economic growth and does more to make us competitive with the rest of the world than any other plan. Don’t take my word for it. Just look at what leading economists across the nation have said and across the ocean have said. Wall Street investment firm and Moody’s says, if we pass the American Rescue Plan it will lead to 4 million more jobs than otherwise would be created. The nonpartisan Brookings Institution has looked at the American Rescue Plan and said the GDP will reach pre pandemic projections by 2021. Meaning we’ll have recovered by end of 2021. Much sooner, by the way, then if we do nothing. Look, just this week, the Congressional Budget Office projected that if we don’t take action, it would take them to the year 2025 to return to full employment. There’s also a growing chorus of top economists right, center and left that say we should be less focused on the deficit and more focused on the investments we make and can make now in jobs, keeping families out of poverty and preventing longterm economic damage to our nation. The simple truth is if we make these investments now with interest rates at historic lows, we’ll generate more growth, higher incomes, a stronger economy and our nation’s finances will be in a stronger position as well. And the pay off won’t just be in jobs, but in our global competitiveness as well, because we’ll be regaining our economic strength faster. So the way I see it, the biggest risks is not going too big, it’s if we go too small. We’ve been here before. When this nation hit the Great Recession that Barack and I inherited in 2009, I was asked to lead the effort on the Economic Recovery Act to get it passed. There was a big recovery package, roughly $800 billion. I did everything I could to get it passed, including getting three Republicans to change their votes and vote for it. But it wasn’t enough. It wasn’t quite big enough. It stemmed the crisis, but the recovery could have been faster and even bigger. Today, we need an answer that the meets the challenge of this crisis, not one that falls short and that’s the issue facing the country right now. What Republicans have proposed is either to do nothing or not enough. All of a sudden, many of them have discovered fiscal restraint and the concern for the deficits. But don’t kid yourself, this is a approach that will come with a cost, more pain for more people for longer than it has to be. Secretary Yellen talks about the scarring effect that comes with prolonged economic pain. We see that scarring effect in economic data, but more important we can see it in the lives of people living with long-term unemployment, living in hunger, at wit’s end over how to keep their jobs and take care of their kids. And then she talks about the need to alleviate long-term suffering in the economy. We can do that. We don’t have to wait until 2025 to get back to full employment, which will be the case if we don’t do this. Again, independent analysis from places like Moody’s on Wall Street, Brookings Institution, the American Rescue Plan could achieve that by the beginning, full employment, by the beginning of next year. So to me, this is what this moment comes down to. Are we going to pass a big enough package to vaccinate people, to get people back to work, to alleviate the suffering in this country this year? That’s what I want to do. Or are we going to say to millions of Americans who are out of work, many of whom have been out of work for six months or longer who have been scarred by this economic and public health crisis, don’t worry. Hang on. Things are going to get better. We’re going to go smaller. So it’s just going to take us a lot longer, like until 2025. That’s the Republican answer right now. I can’t, in good conscience, do that. Too many people in the nation have already suffered for too long through this pandemic and economic crisis and telling them we don’t have the money to alleviate their suffering, to get to full employment sooner, to vaccinate America after $8 trillion in deficit spending over the past four years, much of it having gone to the wealthiest people in the country is neither true, nor necessary. We do have the resources to get to full employment sooner. We do have the tools to reduce a lot of suffering in this country. We just have to choose to use them. So it’s time to act. We can reduce suffering in this country. We can put people back to work. We can gain control of this virus. That’s what the American rescue plan does. And that’s what I’m determined to do. And that’s what I hope we’re going to be able to do in the near term. So may God bless you all, may God protects our troops and I truly believe real help is on the way. Thank you all so very much. Thank you."
"21","02-10-21"," Say good afternoon everyone. I want to give you an update on the latest, regarding our response to the military coup in Burma. As you know, the assault on Burma’s transition to democracy remains an issue of deep bipartisan concern. We’ve consulted at length for example, with Senator McConnell, who is at a very keen interest in this and his team. And we welcome their helpful insights. We’ve also been in close contact with our allies and partners around the world, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region, driving vigorous diplomatic outreach to help coordinate an international response to what happened. The strong and unified message emerging from the United States has been essential in our view to encourage in other countries to join us in pressing for immediate return to democracy. Last week, the United States helped bring together the UN Security Council, which issued a strong statement in support of Burmese democracy. And this week, we will use our renewed engagement on the Human Rights Council to strengthen the world’s commitment to human rights in Burma. Today, I again call on the Burmese military to immediately release the democratic political leaders and activists and they’re now detaining including Aung San Suu Kyi and also Win Myint, the president. The military must relinquish power it seized and demonstrate respect for the world and the people of Burma as expressed in their November 8th election. So today, I’m announcing a series of actions that we’re taking to begin imposing consequences on the leaders of the coup. The US government is taking steps to prevent the generals from improperly having access to the $1 billion in Burmese government funds held in the United States. And today, I’ve approved a new executive order… Excuse me. A new executive order or enabling us to immediately sanction the military leaders who directed the coup, their business interest, as well as close family members. We will identify a first round of targets this week and we’re also going to impose strong exports controls. We’re freezing US assets that benefit the Burmese government while maintaining our support for healthcare, civil society groups, and other areas that benefit the people of Burma directly. And finally, as protests grow, violence against those asserting their democratic rights is unacceptable and we’re going to keep calling it out. The people of Burma are making their voices heard and the world is watching. We’ll be ready to impose additional measures and we’ll continue to work with our international partners to urge other nations to join us in these efforts. So I thank you all. I wanted to have that statement before I got in the vehicle to go out to the Pentagon and I’m sure I’ll see some of you at the Pentagon. Thanks for coming over in such short notice. Thank you."
"22","02-11-21"," A vast majority at least I hope I am of the folks out here at NIH, you know that wearing this mask through the next year here can save lives. A significant number of lives and so I apologize if you don’t hear me as clearly as maybe you should. I’d like to start off by thanking Dr. Collins and Dr. Fauci for hosting me today. I spent a lot of time working with Dr. Collins on Cancer Institute matters and I said he’s the first person I called asking if he’d stay but then I was reminded, I called Dr. Fauci before I got elected saying would you stay if I came. So thank you both for staying. Our nation is fortunate to have both of you in these critical roles and that goes for the world-class doctors, scientists, researchers here at NIH and I just toured the vaccine research center with Dr. Collins and Dr. Fauci and Dr. Graham and Dr. [Colbert 00:01:05]. It’s incredible. It’s a place to go where you … Our top minds spend years researching vaccines and treatments for all kinds of viruses and partnering with academia and industry to prepare for the next one because there will be others. HIV, influenza, SARS, MERS, West Nile, Zika, Ebola, and today COVID-19. To all of you, your work made possible the remarkably rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines we have today. It’s incredible. Initially people were talking years if not decades before we’d have a vaccine. On behalf of a grateful nation, and I don’t say that lightly, on behalf of a grateful nation, I want to thank you and your families for your work and your sacrifice, for there is no doubt your families sacrificed a great deal for the endless hours you put in to save the rest of us and I know it wasn’t easy. The devastation of this pandemic, the loss of life and livelihoods, hasn’t spared the scientific community. Labs closed, research delayed, careers disrupted, especially if you’re those in training. With every moment of despair in this past year, you and all the heroes and heroines on the frontlines and the front tiers of this pandemic remind us who we are. We are America. We never give up. We never give in. We give back and we follow the science and find the answers. That’s what all of you do here. That’s what we’ve seen all across the country. The scientific community repurposed labs to work on COVID-19, developed therapeutics, new diagnostic technologies and vaccines in record time and you’re highlighting lessons learned on the importance of pandemic preparedness, public-private partnership, realtime data sharing, and most of all, speed and efficiency without compromising science and good conscience. Look, you’re an incredible group of people. I’ve been out here many times trying to help you, trying to help my son who passed away with cancer. You’re an incredible, incredible group of people and that’s not hyperbole. [inaudible 00:03:33] we still have a long way to go. It’s no secret that the vaccination program was in much worse shape than my team and I anticipated. We were under the impression and been told that we had a lot more resources than we did when we came into office. We’ve only been here three weeks but we learned a great deal in those three weeks. While scientists did their job in discovering vaccines in record time, my predecessor, to be very blunt about it, did not do his job in getting ready for the massive challenge of vaccinating hundreds of millions of Americans. He didn’t order enough vaccines. He didn’t mobilize enough people to administer the shots. He didn’t set up federal vaccine centers where eligible people could go and get their shots. When I became president three weeks ago, America had no plan to vaccinate most of the country. It was a big mess. It’s going to take time to fix to be blunt with you. I promised when I did my inaugural address that I’d always be straight with you, give it to you straight from the shoulder. I will not walk away. When we make a mistake I’ll acknowledge it and tell you the truth. We started on Day One. We won’t have everything fixed for a while but we’re going to fix it. First, the vaccine. I know people want confidence that it’s safe. Well listen to Dr. Fauci, I did. I got my shots, my wife Jill did, Kamala did and her husband Doug did. So Dr. Fauci and Dr. Collins got it also. It’s safe and we need more people to get vaccinated to beat this pandemic. That’s why in the first three weeks that I’ve been in office, we increased the supply of weekly vaccine shipments to the states by almost 30%. That means millions more Americans will get vaccinated in February than the previous administration was on track to do but that’s just the start. We bought more vaccines. Two weeks ago I directed Jeff Zients who is here with me, my COVID-19 response coordinator, to work with the Department of Health and Human Services to purchase more vaccines. Just this afternoon, we signed a final contract for 100 million more Moderna and 100 million more Pfizer vaccines. We’re also able to move up the delivery dates with an additional 200 million vaccines to the end of July, faster than we expected and in further good news both companies agreed and we’re now contractually obligated to expedite delivery of 100 million doses that were promised by the end of June to deliver them by the end of May. That’s a month faster. That means lives will be saved. That means we’re now on track to have enough supply for 300 million Americans by the end of July. It may not sound like the urgent progress we need but let’s be clear. When I took office just three weeks ago this country did not have a plan or enough vaccines or people to vaccinate Americans. All Americans, any time, at any point in 2021. Within three weeks, round the clock work with so many people, people standing behind me and in front of me, we have now purchased enough vaccine supply to vaccinate all Americans and now we’re working to get those vaccines into the arms of millions of people. In just three weeks you deployed over 1,000 federal staff to vaccinate the vaccination sites around the country. We’re helping give shots and set up and speed up vaccination operations. To date, we have also provided $3 billion to 37 states and territories and tribes to bolster existing vaccination centers and create more of the centers to administer, where we administer the vaccine. For example, three days ago Vice President Harris and I, we had a virtual tour of a federally supported vaccine center in a parking lot of the Arizona Cardinals stadium in Glendale, Arizona. It’s open 24/7. Folks who are eligible can call by phone or sign up online for an appointment. They literally drive in, stay in their cars, get a shot, get a car, and schedule the next shot. On average it is about 30 minutes from start to finish. In just three weeks the site has administered 160,000 doses, now averaging 8,000 vaccinations through day and night. Look, coordination between state and federal government and the private sector partnership is essential. One of the nurses coordinating the effort in Arizona said the work was like administering and I love this phrase, Doc. She said like administering a dose of hope. Like administering a dose of hope. Let me say that, a dose of hope. We’re going to get those doses of hope out at new and large scale vaccination centers that were set up by the federal government. During the Super Bowl, we got a call from the NFL. The commissioner of football Goodell said we could have access to all 30 of the NFL stadiums for mass vaccination sites. We’ve just announced we’ve worked with the governors to set up these new federally run sites in California, New York, Texas, with many more to come. We’re going to target communities that have been the hardest hit and will be staffed by our military, the Federal Emergency Management Association FEMA, the same people who respond to hurricanes and storms and the like, and other federal experts at the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Agriculture to get vaccinators to make sure it gets in people’s arms. When I got to office, there was no federal plan, none, to ship vaccines directly to local pharmacies. So folks, folks were allowed to get a vaccination under the state rules as the allocation of who gets in line are allowed to get one can schedule an appointment now and get COVID-19 vaccine shots like they would a flu shot from their pharmacy. It will start today, that program. For folks who can’t get to a pharmacy, we’re deploying mobile units and sending vaccines to community health centers, federally run community health centers, to take care of the poorest of the poor, that reach the hardest hit, the most underserved areas in the country, black, Latino, Native American and rural communities. This is an importance piece to ensure racial equity remains at the center of our COVID-19 response which is something I know Dr. Collins and Dr. Fauci are focused on as well. Another point of progress is we’re deploying more vaccinators. We’re now allowing retired doctors and nurses to come back and administer shots. We’re deploying vaccinators and over the last three weeks we’ve put hundreds of new vaccinators in the field and they’re lining up thousands more. These include medical personnel from our Commission Corps at the Department of Health and Human Services as well as personnel from FEMA, the Defense Department, and more departments to come. All told, we are on track to surpass the goal I set on Day One. When I was sworn in I indicated … Just before I was sworn in I indicated that my hope was to administer 100 million shots in the first 100 days of our term. I believe we’ll not only reach that but we’ll break that. Like I said before, that’s just the floor. That’s just the floor. Our end goal is beating COVID-19 which brings us to the challenge that remains. We remain in the teeth of this pandemic. January of 2021 was the deadliest month we’ve had. We lost over 100,000, 100,000 of our fellow citizens. We’re on track to cross 500,000 dead Americans this next month. The new strains emerging create immense challenges and masking is still the easiest thing to do to save lives. We need everyone to mask up and by the way, I know it’s a pain in the neck, but it’s a patriotic responsibility. We’re in the middle of a war with this virus. It’s a patriotic responsibility, not only if you care about your family, you care about your fellow Americans. You realize more people have died in the last 12 months than died in all four years in World War II? All four years. That’s why I ask with the full extent of my authority as President of the United States could be, I signed an executive order that required masking on all federal property, on modes of travel like planes, trains and buses across interstate commerce. I have been calling on governors, Republican and Democrat, mayors, Republican and Democrat, and local officials to institute mask mandates within their jurisdictions. We need everyone to do their part for themselves, for their loved ones, and yes for their country. Mask up America. Mask up, and to really get ahead of this pandemic instead of chasing it. We need Congress to pass my American Rescue Plan. I’m grateful that the Senate and the House are moving quickly and my hope is that we’ll get Republicans as well as Democrats to support us. But we can’t wait. People are dying every minute from this pandemic and we’re suffering profound economic crisis that the pandemic has created. Every major economist in the country, left, right and center says we can’t go big enough here. If we want to get our economy back in shape, we’ve got to move quickly. How many of you out there don’t have enough food to eat? How many of you out there are worrying whether you can pay next month’s rent or pay your mortgage? How many of you out there have a child at home because the school’s not open, you have to make the difficult choice of staying home with your child or going to work if you have a job? This is not who we are. The United States of America, we take care of our own. Job number one of the American Rescue Plan is fighting the pandemic. It puts $160 billion into our national COVID strategy which includes more money for testing and tracing, manufacturing and distribution, and setting up vaccination sites, everything that’s needed to get vaccines into people’s arms. The American Rescue Plan also includes $4 billion to build new manufacturing plants so we are ready to manufacture vaccines and we don’t have to wait. There’s simply nothing more important than getting the resources we need to vaccinate people in this country as quickly as possible. As quickly as possible. We’re not going to get our economy back in shape and millions of people back to work until we beat this virus. As I said, everyone from Moody’s on Wall Street to a whole range of other think tanks indicates that if we do this plan, we’ll get to full employment within two years. We’ll be in a situation where we actually grow the economy, creating millions of jobs immediately and put us in a position where we are going to have the GDP grow at a higher rate than if we don’t do this. I want to close with this. We’re in a national emergency and this will be one of the most difficult operational challenges we have ever undertaken as a nation. It’s going to take time. We’re going to face setbacks along the way and I promise you when we do I’ll just own up to it and say what they are. But we have to stay vigilant. We have to stay focused and for God’s sakes, we have to remember who we are. We are the United States of America. We can do this. We have the resources. We just have to choose to use them. We have to do what all of you do here at NIH and across the scientific community. Keep the faith with purpose, vision and with every dose of hope we have. Folks, remember, like I said, this is America. We have never, never, never failed. We’ve decided to stand together and act together. That’s who we are. That’s not chauvinism, that’s just a fact. We’ve never failed when we stood together, and if there’s ever a time we need to stand together it’s now. May God bless you all and may God bless everyone here at NIH, all the doctors, scientists and researchers fighting this pandemic and saving lives, and may God protect our troops. Thank you very, very much. You’re the best America has to offer at NIH. Thank you, thank you from the bottom of my heart."
"23","02-17-20"," … that’s a higher rate than these guys pay for their capital gains. Now, look, going on too much. Let me conclude and go to questions because here’s the deal, and we can do questions. By the way, I will not be offended when I stop if you all leave. I don’t mean you have to stay, but I really appreciate you coming. Let me end my formal remarks or informal formal remarks. On the following note: Folks, when I got elected to the United States Senate, I was 29-years old. Thank you, man. I was 29-years old. I wasn’t old enough to be sworn in as a U.S. Senator. For real. I had to wait 17 days to be constitutionally-eligible to be sworn in. I’m the first United States Senator I ever knew, Lieutenant Governor, the first one I ever knew. You think I’m joking. I’m not. I mean, I didn’t know anybody by their first name before that. I come from, like a lot of you do, fairly modest means. We weren’t poor, but when my dad lost work in Scranton, there was nothing there. We moved down to a little steel town called Claymont, Delaware. It took three years, but my dad finally got us a house and we lived in what is now Section Eight housing, was Section Eight housing. There wasn’t any Section Eight then. My dad was able, he got us a lovely home in a suburban neighborhood. It was three bedrooms, split-level house, four kids with a grandpop living with us. It wasn’t like I came from money, but I came from principal. I came from moms and dads who believed that the only important thing was that you just go out there and do your best. The quote they’d always used was, “Joey, measure of success is not whether you get knocked down, how many times you get knocked down. It’s how quickly you get up.” Just get up, get up. I really mean this. It’s time for America to get up. We are so much better. I am more optimistic about America’s chances in the 21st century than I’ve ever been in my entire life. My word. We have the most productive workers in the world. Our workers are three times as productive as workers in Asia. Fact. We’re the wealthiest nation in the history of the world and will remain that if in fact we invest in our people and not in a few and send the money overseas. We also are in a position where, I’ve met every major world leader, not a joke, not because I’m important because the nature of my job. I was Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee so I had that responsibility internationally and the reason why Barack picked me to be vice president was because of my background in international affairs and my ability to know how to work the United States Congress. They’re the two reasons I got picked. I’ve met every major one. I’ve never met one single leader in the world, not a joke, who wouldn’t trade places in a heartbeat with the President of United States or the problems the president has. They pale by comparison. I got criticized by some, including in this among the 800 people running for the nomination, for saying I wasn’t worried about China. I’m not worried about China if we do our job, if we invest in our people. China, I spent more time with Xi Jinping, the leader of China, than any world leader has, at least up to the time we left office because Barack wanted me to get to know him. I traveled 17,000 miles with him. I had 25 hours of private meals with him, with an interpreter. By the way, my interpreter handled all his notes in after the meetings. Yeah, kind of strange thing, huh? Transparency’s turned out to be a really rare deal. He’d ask profound questions. He doesn’t have a democratic, meaning small D, democratic bone in his body, but he’s a smart guy. He’d asked me questions like, “Do you really control your military?” Not a joke, because no president of the country has ever controlled the military in China. It was controlled by the party, not the president. “What do governors do?” Because governors have no authority to move on their own in China and so on. One night we’re in a place called Chung Du, a town of almost 20 million people on the Tibetan plateau, and I have an interpreter whispering in my ear and in his. He looks at me, he says, “Can you define America for me?” “Xi, I can one word,” and I meant it, “possibilities.” We have always believed in America anything is possible. Anything. Anything. Anything. Anything. Anything is possible. Folks, in China, just to give one example, in China, and I don’t say this with any satisfaction, in China more people are going to die of cancer in the ’20s, from 2020 to 2030, than all the rest of the world combined. Fact. Any of you oncologist in here or docs, you can verify that, or you can Google it if you want to. The fact is that’s a fact. Number two, they don’t have enough water. W-A-T-E-R. Potable water, which Nevada has to be a little concerned about as well, I might add, long term. But they’re talking about spending hundreds of billions of dollars to try to change the direction of their rivers so they can get water. Whose estimate, if you take between 35 and 42% of the land, the arable land, in China is blue with cadmium. They can’t grow things. They have a million Uyghurs Muslims in concentration camps in the West. You see what’s happening, going on in Hong Kong. Folks, there’s not a country in the world that can compete with us. If we focus on who we are, so it’s time to get up and take back this country and move it in the direction we have to go. Thank you all very much. Okay. If you ask me easy questions, I’ll give you quick answers. No, but by the way, if they’re essays, then I’m going to give you shorter answers to get it about, we got about, they tell me the commitment with the school here, we have about another 10 to 15 minutes. But let me begin. Sir, go ahead. You’re smart. You’re well-educated. You’re experienced, got class and you’ve got character. None of your opponents for the Democratic nomination have all of those characteristics, all together. Okay, maybe they’ve got one or two or three. Okay, if you get the nomination in November, it’ll be Mr. Rogers versus Darth Vader. Well, that’s a good question. He complimented me very highly and then said, “What the hell’s the matter with your campaign?” That’s a good question. No, it’s a legitimate question. Thank you. Number one, when they did all the cross-tab stuff, one of the foremost difficult states for me to win was going to be in Iowa because … and they’re good people … it’s all white, and it’s all the Midwestern Islam, and it’s a lot of farming. But we did okay, if you take a look at what happened there. I mean, it was kind of a unusual thing that I hope doesn’t happen here. No, I mean in terms of the actual running of the caucus, how it worked out. But number two, look, my support in the Democratic Party, and all the data’s still shows it, we’ll see, is that I am a candidate who has the broadest support from all sectors of the economy. For example, I have had historically overwhelming support from the African-American community. I mean 75% favorable ratings, support because I come out of the Civil Rights movement. If you take a look, the only presidents who’ve ever beaten an incumbent president in this century are, the Democrats, were Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. They had overwhelming support from African-American community. You can’t win, in my view, without that happening. I’m heading to South Carolina from here. Secondly, we’re in a situation where there is, I’ve had overwhelming support from, at the same time, working class, high school educated whites because, out of Pennsylvania. The reason I was picked to be on Barack’s ticket was the data showed that how much, how popular I was in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and the states we’ve lost including Michigan and so on. I have more support in that group than anybody does. Thirdly, I have significant support across the board, particularly including with the burgeoning Latino community of the United States of America. In my state of Delaware, for example, [inaudible 00:09:46] don’t think about it, in the 2000 census my state of Delaware had the highest increase in Latinos of any state in the nation. We had the Spanish speaking community in my state, whereas people that the president does not even understand are Americans, Puerto Ricans. No, he really didn’t. It was just bizarre. I get significant support from minority communities, the Jewish community and other minority communities, the Muslim community. I think that we’re now just getting into the deal. We’re now getting into the thick of it. For example, Bill Clinton lost 12 primary before he won one and became the nominee for president. I’m not counting on waiting that long. But all kidding aside, I think that we’re just getting there. We’ve had less than 2% of the vote taken so far. Now we’re here in Nevada, and it’s going to be up to you to decide how many of us move on, here and in South Carolina. I taught constitutional law for 22 years and I am very supportive of the constitutional notion of separation of powers. A lot of people will run and stand up and say, “On the first time I’m going to do this,” and they’re going to do things that they can’t do because they constitutionally can’t do them. But I can constitutionally eliminate every executive order he’s put forward. No, I mean it. There is not one I can think of. Healthcare. The environment. We didn’t even talk about the environment. Look what it means up here for you all. By the way, I was speaking with some of the firefighters, it doesn’t matter whether you rake your leaves, You’re still going to have fires. By the way, windmills don’t cause cancer. No, but I’m not joking. [inaudible 00:12:02]. Yeah, that’s exactly right. But all kidding aside, all of them, I mean, I can’t think of one that has been well intended even. Look at all of the executive orders he issues relative to the idea of an EPA, the Environment Protection Agency. Now what I will do, and what Barack and I did do, we significantly reduce the impediments for regulations to get moving on building things. That we can do, like we did the Tappan Zee Bridge, all of these things. You could do it without eviscerating any of the environmental laws or any of the laws relating to labor. God love you. I just pray for them. That’s not who we are. Number one, no child, period, will be held in a cage. Period. Period. Period. For me, immigration is all about family. All about family reunification. Nobody will be deported who is here in fact, unless they are in a position of having committed a felony while here or they engaged in a major felony, we find out about it. We’re not going to be standing outside of mass, we’re not be standing outside of the doctor’s office, we’re not going to stand outside and arresting people. The anxiety-causing. Look, here’s the deal. Think about this. One of the things I’m going to do when I put together an entire plan and I’m going to do it literally the first … and they’re going to announce it in detail, if and when elected, and begin to implement it between now and the time that I get sworn in. We have now 24 out of every 100 students in school today is a Latino. 24 out of every 100. 24. We’re in a situation as well where we find that we have a population of people who have been here, over 11 million people and they’re not all Latino, there’s Asian, there are African across the board. That, in fact, I’m going to lay down a detail … already have it written … a pathway to citizenship, it’s earned, and make sure that everybody is able to get into that pathway. I’m going to, once again, legalize all the DACA students. These DACA students are more American than most Americans are. No, I’m serious. Think about it. You come along and you’re eight-years old and Mom says, “We’re crossing the road.” “No, Mom, leave me here. I don’t want to go. I don’t want to.” They don’t know where they’re from. They’ve never been there. They’ve been good, decent citizens and they’re great additions. By the way, we didn’t talk about it and I won’t go into unless you want me to later, but here’s the deal. Think about this. You know why are social security system is still solvent? Because of immigration. They didn’t cost us anything. They’re paying for it. You got it mom. That’s the reason why it’s moving. Look, we should look at this like we have in the past. We always have had xenophobic people in this country like Trump. It last anywhere from 2 years to 10 to 12 years, but then we overcome it quickly. We overcome it and we open it up. My Irish ancestors, when they’d got on a coffin ship out in the Irish Sea in 1849 in the middle of a famine, they didn’t know whether they were going to make it. They didn’t know where they were going to live. They didn’t know what was going to happen, but they got in and did it. All of you, unless you’re an African-American and your ancestors were taken over here in the bottom of a ship in changes, every one of you came because you had some reason to have to come. Guess what? The idea someone is sitting down in Guadalajara or somewhere in South America or in the West, I mean, excuse me, in Africa and saying, “I got a great idea, let’s sell everything we have. Let’s give it to a coyote, take it across the border, drop us in the desert by ourself, a place that doesn’t want us. Won’t that be fun? Let’s go. I’m serious. That’s how we think about it, for God’s sake. We have a right to protect our borders. Every country has and must. But the bad guys, the criminals, the drug dealers, the drugs, the terrorism is coming through the legitimate ports of entry. That’s where they’re coming through. Here’s the deal, we are unwilling yet to spend the money, which is 1/20th what it costs for a wall, to put in the modern technology. For example, we have the ability, for lack of a better way of phrasing without boring you, to have X-Ray machines that sit on top of tractor trailers and can tell you everything that’s inside that tractor trailer, where the people are hiding in there, whether there’s arms arm hiding in there, whether there’s contraband, drugs or whatever. And using drones and a whole range. But we’re not doing it, because I don’t think that’s why he’s doing what he’s doing. He’s doing what he’s doing because he wants to scare people. He wants to turn the other into the enemy. He wants to say, “You’re being invaded, they’re going to rape your children, your daughter.” I mean, that’s what it’s all about. You hear what he just did on the sanctuary cities? But here’s what he’s done. He’s taken the military arm, the heavily-armed folks who are the teams you see getting out of the back of vehicles with the vests on and the guns and the rest. He’s sending them into sanctuary cities. It’s all about trying to scare you. How many times did you hear in the 2018 election that their coming? You see a picture of this caravan coming up. You’re about to be invaded. They’re going to take over, they’re going to, you’re going to come in and they’re going to do this, that, and the other thing. We’ve always said xenophobes like that and racists like this. We have a right to protect our border. We have a right to determine who comes through that border, but to do what we’re doing. The last thing I’ll say, I’m going to surge. This is the first time in American history someone seeking asylum is not allowed to seek it on American soil. My wife went across the border in Brownsville on Christmas to sign … I mean, excuse me, Thanksgiving to provide meals. It’s squalor they’re living in on the other side of Brownsville. It’s squalor. It’s unhealthy. It’s terrible. So I’m going to surge to the border. I’m going to double the number of immigration officers going, immigration judges, as well as those folks who are focusing on making the initial judgment of whether or not someone seeking asylum has a legitimate basis. If they don’t, you put them back on the plane, you taken them back to an area that’s safe when in their country. That’s why I did one other thing, and I’ll stop, I won’t go into it, but I’m the guy, which can’t get things done. Well, as vice president, I was able to put together a group of Republicans and Democrats to provide $750 billion to the three states in question, which were sending unaccompanied minors and say, “We’re going to change the circumstance on the grounds so they don’t want to leave in the first place.” And it started to work. I’d go into small towns and cities in El Salvador, I wouldn’t give them money, make sure the State Department would not give the money to the leaders who were corrupt. We’d say, “Well, we’ll do the lighting for you in the city. We’ll erect essentially Boys and Girls Clubs. We’ll increase the number of hospitals, will pay for nurses, et cetera.” The reason why people leave. Guess what? Immigration slowed down significantly until Trump came along and said, “I’m not going to fund that anymore. Anyway, it’s a long story but it was too much [inaudible 00:20:20] Thank you all. Mr. Vice President? Mr. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. This will be the last question. I appreciate it very, very much. Mr. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I need your help."
"24","02-17-21"," Welcome. We are live in the Pabst Theater in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. This is a CNN Presidential Town Hall, the first with President Joe Biden. I’m Anderson Cooper. President Biden is just four weeks into his presidency and facing multiple crises. Nearly 500,000 of our fellow citizens, Americans have died from COVID-19. Millions out of work right now and a nation dangerously divided. Tonight we’re going to be answering questions from the American people. The president will be answering questions from the American people on his first official trip since taking office. Some of the questioners here voted for him, some did not. The president and I will not be wearing masks on this stage. He of course has been vaccinated. Over the past several weeks I have repeatedly tested negative for coronavirus as recently as yesterday and this morning as well. We will however be keeping our distance from one another and the audience is very limited, socially distanced and all wearing masks when they’re seated. With that, I want to welcome the 46th President of the United States, President Joe Biden. Hi Anderson. Good to see you man. Hi folks, how are you? Good to be back, man. It’s nice to see you, sir. You know you enjoy being home with the baby more. I do, yes. He’s nine and a half months, so I’m very happy. I get it. No, no. Everybody knows I like kids better than people. I saw a picture of you with your grandson recently. That’s right. Yeah. So we got a lot of questions in the audience. We have about 50 or so people here. They are all socially distanced. We have some folks who voted for you, some folks who did not, and we’re going to get as many questions in as possible. Before we get to that, I just want to start with a couple of just big picture questions about the pandemic and where we are right now. Sure. New cases of COVID-19, hospitalizations have fallen by half in the last month, so have new cases. That’s the good news. There’s this potential threat, potential surge from the variants coming down the pike potentially. By the end of July this year. We have … We came into office, there was only 50 million doses that were available. We have now … By the end of July, we’ll have over 600 million doses, enough to vaccinate every single American. When you say by the end of July, do you mean that they will be available or that people will have been able to actually get them? Because Dr. They’ll be available. They’ll be available. They’ll be available. Okay. Here look. What we did, we got into office and found out the supply, there was no backlog. There was nothing in the refrigerator figuratively and literally speaking and there were 10 million doses a day that were available. We’ve upped that, in the first weeks that we were in office to significantly more than that. We’ve moved out, went to the Pfizer and Moderna, and said, “Can you produce more vaccine and more rapidly?” They not only agreed to go from 200 to 400, then they have agreed to go to 600 million doses. We got them to move up the time because we used the National Defense Act to be able to help the manufacturing piece of it to get more equipment and so on. So if the end of April … Excuse me, end of July, they’re available to actually get them in the arms of people who want them. Well no, a lot will be being vaccinated in the meantime. Okay. In other words it’s not all of a sudden 600 million doses are going to appear, and what’s going to happen is it’s going to continue to increase as we move along and we’ll have reached 400 million by the end of May and 600 million by the end of July and the biggest thing though as you remember when you and I … I shouldn’t say it t hat way, as you remember, but when you and i talked last, we talked about … It’s one thing to have the vaccine which we didn’t have when we came into office, but a vaccinator … How do you get the vaccine into someone’s arm? So you need the paraphernalia, you need the needle, you need the mechanisms to be able to get it in, you have to have people who can inject it in people’s arms. That’s been one of the problems is just getting enough people. Yes. Now we have made significant strides increasing the number of vaccinators. I issued an executive order allowing former retired docs and nurses to do it. We have over 1,000 military personnel. The CDC is … I mean excuse me, the … We have gotten the National Guard engaged. So we have significant number of vaccinators, people who would actually be there, plus we have opened up a considerable number of locations where you can get the vaccination. I want to introduce you to Kevin Michel. He’s an independent from Wauwatosa. He’s a mechanical engineer for a vehicle company. Kevin, welcome. Hi. Welcome to Milwaukee. Good. My questions is regarding education. Yes. Considering that hybrid and virtual school instruction have been in place for nearly a year now, what is the plan and recommendation to get students back into the brick and mortar buildings? As a parent of four children, I find it imperative that they get back to school as safely as possible. My mother would say, “God bless you son. No purgatory for you.” Four kids home, I really mean it. By the way, the loss of being able to be in school is having significant impact on the children and parents as well. What we found out is there are certain things that make it rational and easy to go back to the brick and mortar building. One, first of all, making sure everybody is wearing protective gear. It’s available to students as well as to teachers, the janitors, the people who work in the cafeteria, the bus drivers. Secondly, organizing in smaller pods, which means that’s why we need more teachers. Instead of a classroom of 30 kids in it, you have three classes and that same of 10 kids each in those. I’m making the number up, less … It doesn’t have to be literally 10. For example, school bus drivers. We got to make sure that you don’t have 60 kids or however many, it would depend on the size of the school bus, sitting two abreast in every single seat, and so there’s a lot of things we can do short of … I think that we should be vaccinating teachers. We should move them up in the hierarchy as well. Let me ask you, your administration had set a goal to open the majority of schools in your first 100 days. You’re now saying that means those schools may only be open for at least one day a week. No, that’s not true. That’s what was reported, that’s not true. That was a mistake in the communication, but what I’m talking about is I said opening the majority of schools in K through eighth grade because they’re the easiest to open, the most needed to be opened in terms of the impact on children and families having to stay home. I think we’ll be close to that at the end of the first 100 days. We’ve had a significant percentage of them being able to be opened. I think many of them five days a week. The goal will be five days a week. Now it’s going to be harder to open up the high schools for the reasons I said. Just like, if you notice, the contagion factor in colleges is much higher than it is in high schools or grade schools. I want you to meet … This is Justin Belot, he’s a high school teacher from Milwaukee who is a Democrat. Justin, thanks for being with us. I teach English. High school English. My wife teaches. God love you. Wonderful. Thank you Mr. President. So along the same lines of schools, so this great debate on when to transition to in-person learning. Number one, nobody is suggesting, including the CDC in this recent report that you have large classes, congested classes. It’s smaller classes, more ventilation, making sure that everybody has masks and is socially distanced, meaning you have les … Fewer students in one room. Making sure that everyone from the sanitation workers who work in the lavatories, in the bathrooms and do all the maintenance, that they are in fact able to be protected as well. Making sure you’re in a situation where you don’t have the congregation of a lot of people, and as I said, including the school bus, including getting on a school bus. So it’s about needing to be able to socially distance, smaller classes, more protection, and I think that teachers and the folks who work in the school, the cafeteria workers and others, should be on the list of preferred to get a vaccination. I want to introduce you to Kerri Engebrecht, an independent from Oak Creek. Kerri, welcome. Go ahead. Thank you. Very good, thank you. Our 19-year-old son was diagnosed with pediatric COPD at the age of 14. We’re told he has the lungs of a 60 year old. He does all he can to protect himself. Last month he even removed himself from the campus of UW-Madison as he feels it’s safer and he has less exposure here at home. We’ve tried all we can to get him a vaccine. I hear of others who are less vulnerable getting it based on far less. Well the answer is yes there are but here’s how it works. The states make the decisions on who is … In what order. I can make recommendations, and for federal programs, I can do that as President of the United States, but I can’t tell the state you must move such and such a group of people up, but here’s what I’d like to do. If you’re willing, I’ll stay around after this is over, and maybe we can talk a few minutes and see if I can get you some help. Let me just ask you though, Johnson & Johnson could be authorized, a new vaccine from them could be authorized in a couple weeks. That would be a big deal. Yes it would. Bringing a lot more vaccines on, millions of more doses to the supply. Well it depends on how much they have available. I think there still should be priority groups in case there are not enough for everyone, available to everybody. And look, we don’t know for certain. London. Yeah. The British strain and London and et cetera. There’s thus far, thus far, there is no evidence that the existing vaccinations available from Moderna and Pfizer do not either make sure that they apply … They work as well against the strain in the United States, and there is no evidence that they’re not helpful. So if you can get a vaccination, get it whenever you can get it, regardless of the other strains that are out there. There are studies going on to determine it is not only more communicable but are there vaccine … Do the vaccines not provide helpful protection by getting the vaccine? There are some speculation, I got to be very careful here because millions of people are watching this. It may not be as effective. Against a variant, but it still would be effective. Still be effective. So the clear notion is, if you’re eligible, if it’s available, get the vaccine. Get the vaccine. I want you to meet, this is Dessie Levy, a Democrat from Milwaukee. She’s a registered nurse, former academic dean. She’s also currently director of a faith-based nonprofit. Dessie, welcome. By the way, you’ve heard me say this before Becky. If there’s any angels in heaven, they’re all nurses, male and female. Doctors let you live, nurses make you want to live. I can tell you as a consumer of healthcare and my family. You’re wonderful. Thank you for what you do. God bless you. Mr. President, hello. My name is Dr. Dessie Levy and my question to you is considering COVID-19 and its significant impact on black Americans, especially here in Milwaukee, and thus the exacerbation of our racial disparities in healthcare, we have seen less than three percent of blacks and less than five percent of Hispanics given the total number of vaccines that have been administered to this point. Is this a priority for the Biden administration and how will the disparities be addressed and that’s both locally and nationally. Well first of all it is a priority, number one. Number two, there’s two reasons for it being the way it is. Number one, there is some history of blacks being used as guinea pigs in other experiments, I need not tell you, doctor, over the last 50 to 75 to 100 years in America so there is a concern about getting the vaccine, whether it’s available or not, but the biggest part of it is access, physical access. That’s why last week I opened up … I met with the Black Caucus in the United States Congress and agreed that I would … All of the community health centers now which take care of the toughest of the toughest neighborhoods in terms of illness, they are going to get a million doses a week and how we’re going to move forward, because they’re in the neighborhood. Secondly, we have opened up and I’m making sure that there’s doses of vaccine for over 6,700 pharmacies because almost everyone lives within not always walking distance but within the distance of being able to go to the pharmacy like when you got your flu shot. That is also now being opened. Thirdly, I also am providing for mobile vans, mobile units to go into neighborhoods that are hard to get to because people are on … For example, even though everyone is within basically five miles of a Walgreens let’s say, the fact is if you’re 70 years old, you don’t have a vehicle and you live in a tough neighborhood meaning it’s a high concentration of COVID, you’re not likely to be able to walk five miles to go get a vaccine. The other thing we found is, and I’m sorry to go on, but this is really important to me. The other portion is a lot of people don’t know how to register. Not everybody in the community, in the Hispanic and the African-American community, particularly in rural areas that are distant and/or inner city districts, know how to use … Know how to get online to determine how to get in line for that COVID vaccination at the Walgreens or at the particular store. So we’re also … I’ve committed to spend a billion dollars on public education to help people figure out how they can get in there. That’s why we’re also trying to set up mass vaccination centers like places in stadiums and the like. Sure. Older people, it’s young people just trying to find a place to get a vaccine. Yes, and I have because look what we inherited. We inherited a circumstance here where … And now for the first … We did a lot in the first two weeks, a circumstances where number one, there weren’t many vaccinators. You didn’t know where you could go get a vaccine administered to you because there was no one to put it in your arm, number one. Number two, there was very little federal guidance as to say what to look for, how to find out where in fact you could go. … And go online, and every single state now has a slightly different mechanism by which they say who’s qualified, where you can get the vaccines and so on. So it’s all about trying to more rationalize in detail so ordinary people like me can understand, I mean that sincerely. I mean, my grandchildren can use that online make me look like I’m in the seventh century. But all kidding aside, it is a process and it’s going to take time. Think of what we didn’t do, and you and I talked about this during the campaign, we didn’t do from the time it hit the United States. You’re going to inject someone and your arm is going to go away, you’ll all be down by Easter. We wasted so much time, so much time. Another question about vaccines. This is Jessica Salas, she’s an independent from Milwaukee, a graphic designer. Jessica, welcome. Thank you. As we’ve been talking about the coronavirus is very real and very scary, and it’s especially scary for children who may or may not understand. Layla. Layla, a beautiful name. First of all, kids don’t get COVID very often, it’s unusual for that to happen. The evidence so far is children aren’t the people most likely to get COVID, number one. Number two, we haven’t even done tests yet on children as to whether or not the certain vaccines would work or not work or what is needed. So you’re the safest group of people in the whole world, number one. Number two, you’re not likely to be able to be exposed to something and spread it to mommy or daddy and it’s not likely mommy and daddy are able to spread it to you either. So, I wouldn’t worry about a baby, I promise you, but I know it’s worrisome. Second. Oh, you’re getting old. Second grade. No. No. No. See that’s a scary thing too. You don’t get to go to school, you don’t get to see your friends, and so what a lot of kids and, I mean, and big people too, older people, their whole lives have sort of changed like when it used to be. It used to be this go outside and play with your friends and get in the school bus and go to school and everything was normal, and now when things change people get really worried and scared. But don’t be scared, honey, don’t be scared, you’re going to be fine and we’re going to make sure mommy is fine too. Sure. … Who are hurting. Well, all the experts, all the committee that I put together with the leading researchers in the world and the United States are on this committee of mine, are headed of by Dr. Fauci and others. They tell me, “Be careful not to predict things that you don’t know for certain what’s going to happen because then you’ll be held accountable.” I get that. But let me tell you what I think based on all that I’ve learned and all that I’ve studied and all that I think that I know, it’s a high probability that the vaccinations that are available today and the new one, Johnson & Johnson God willing will prove to be useful, that with those vaccinations the ability to continue to spread the disease is going to diminish considerably because of what they call herd immunity. And now they’re saying somewhere around 70% of the people have to constitute, some people said 50, see. Have antibodies. And have antibodies and have antibodies. And so if that works that way, as my mother would say with the grace of God and the goodwill of the neighbors, that by next Christmas I think we’ll be in a very different circumstance, God willing, than we are today. I think a year from now when it’s 22 below zero here, no, a year from now I think that there’d be significantly fewer people having to be socially distanced, have to wear a mask, they said, but we don’t know. So I don’t want to over promise anything here. I told you when I ran and when I got elected, I will always level with you. I use Franklin Roosevelt’s example, I’ll shoot and give you straight from the shoulder, straight from the shoulder what I know and what I don’t know. We don’t know for certain but it is highly unlikely that by the beginning of next year’s traditional school year in September we are not significantly better off than we are today. But it matters, it matters whether you continue to wear that mask, it matters whether you continue to socially distance, it matters whether you wash your hands with hot water, those things matter, they matter and that can save a lot of lives while we’re getting to this point, we get to herd immunity. You’ve made passing the COVID relief bill the focus of your first 100 days. Those in the right say the proposal is too big, some of the left say it’s not big enough. Are you committed to passing $ 1. I’m committed to pass. Look, some of you are probably economists there, college professors or teachers in school. This is the first time in my career, and as you can tell I’m over 30. The first time in my career that there is a consensus among economists left, right, and center and including the IMF and in Europe that the overwhelming consensus is, in order to grow the economy a year, two, three, and four down the line, we can’t spend too much. Now is the time we should be spending, now is the time to go big. You may recall I managed the last experiment we had with the stimulus and it was 800, no, I don’t mean it that way, but it was $800 billion. We thought we needed more than that and we think we did. It ended up working but it slowed things up by about… And it depended on who you talk to, between six months and a year and a half. We can come back, we can come roaring back. It’s estimated by most economists including Wall Street firms as well as think tanks, political think tanks left right and center, it is estimated that if we pass this bill alone will create seven million jobs this year, seven million jobs this year. And so the thing we haven’t talked about I’m not going to go on because I want to hear your question, I apologize, we haven’t talked about… I remember you and I talking during the campaign and you had the former guy saying that, well, we just can open things up and that’s all we need to do. And we said, “No, you got to deal with the disease before you deal with getting the economy going.” Well, the fact is that the economy now has to be dealt with and what is it? Look at all the people, you have over 10 million people unemployed. We need unemployment insurance, we need to make sure that you have for 40% of the children in America… I talk about food shortage, 60% of it. Did you ever think you’d see a day in Milwaukee, you’d see in the last six months people lining up in their automobiles for an hour for as far as you could see to get a bag of food? I mean, this is the United States of America for God’s sake. We can’t deal with that? We promised to look at all the people who were on the verge of being kicked out of their apartments because they can not afford their rent. What happens when that happens? Everything. Look at all the mom and pop, the landlords that are in real trouble if we don’t subsidize this in the meantime. Look at all the people who are on the verge of missing and how many people have missed their last two mortgage payments and are able to be foreclosed. And that’s why I took executive action to say they can not be foreclosed down in the meantime, because look at what the impact on the economy would be. You think it’s bad now, let all that happen. Look at all the people who have lost their insurance, how many… I’m not asking for show of hands, how many of you had jobs with corporations or companies that provided healthcare? The COBRA healthcare? Well, guess what? The company goes under and guess what? You lose your health insurance. Well, we should be making sure you’re able to pay for that so that we keep people moving. So I think bigger and the vast majority of the serious people say bigger is better now not spending less. This is Randy Lange, an independent who supported Donald Trump in 2020. Randy is the co-owner of a woodworking company here in Milwaukee. Randy, welcome. You’re proposing a $15 minimum wage. Given the lower cost of living in specifically in the Midwest many business owners are concerned that this will put them out of business, forcing them to downsize or cut benefits. Well, first of all, the South is not much different than the Midwest in that regard as well. But here’s the thing, if you look back over the last 40 years as minimum wages increased the end result of net employment hasn’t changed. The vast majority of the economists, and there’s studies that show that by increasing the minimum wage to $15 an hour it could have an impact on a number of businesses but it would be de minimis, et cetera. Here’s the deal, it’s about doing it gradually where it’s $7.25 an hour. No one should work 40 hours a week and live in poverty, no one should work 40 hours and live in poverty. But it’s totally legitimate for small business owners to be concerned about how that changes. For example, if we gradually increased it, when we indexed it at seven 20, if we kept it indexed by 20 to inflation people would be making 20 bucks an hour right now, that’s what it would be. The congressional budget office says that a $15 minimum wage would lift 900,000 people out of poverty but would also cause 1. Yes, but there’s also if you read that whole thing about Pinocchio’s and all the rest, there are also equal numbers studies saying that wouldn’t have that effect, and particularly as you do it in terms of how gradually you do it. So let’s say, you said you’re going to increase the minimum wage from $7.25 an hour between now and the year 2025 to two $12 an hour, to $13 an hour. You double someone’s pay and the impact on business would be absolute diminish and/or grow the GDP and it will grow and would generate economic growth. But it’s not a legitimate as a small business person to worry about whether or not increasing it at one felled swoop would have that impact. I do support a $15 minimum wage, I think there is equally as much if not more evidence to dictate that it would grow the economy and long run and medium run benefited small businesses as well as large businesses and it would not have such a dilatory effect, but that’s a debatable issue. I want you to meet another small business owner. This is Tim Eichinger, a Democrat from Milwaukee, Co-owner of Black Husky Brewing. Tim, welcome. Thank you. My partner and I own a small brewery in the River West neighborhood of Milwaukee and we have nine amazing employees. We rely primarily on selling our beer out of our tap room, and with the pandemic our business has gone down about 50%. Now, we’ve relied primarily on loans, grants, as well as our own reserves to survive. However, the new assistance has been too slow and recently it’s gotten more restrictive on how we can apply it. Change it drastically, first of all by making sure we have inspectors general. You may remember when the first bill passed, you may remember there was a guy running saying, “What’s going to happen is the banks aren’t going to lend you the money. They’re going to ask you a question, ‘Do you have your credit with us? How many loans do you have with us? What credit cards you have with us?'” Because even though they were being underwritten and we build their rear ends out last time out it was too much trouble to lend to you. What did the president do? And I don’t want to pick on the fashion, I’m tired of talking about Donald Trump, I don’t want to talk about him anymore. But the last administration spent time, a lot of time talking about how there was no need for inspector generals. We found out that 40% of the money, the PPP loans to go to small businesses went to corporations that were multimillion dollar corporations. You’re going to see an investigation showing that a lot of this was fraudulent where it went. So what I’m doing is I provide $60 billion for you to be able to make capital investments in order to be able to open safely and make sure you’re in a position that you can do the things that are recommended. You’ve noticed there’s been very little federal directions for you all as to how to safely open your businesses. Yet you know if you’re able to test your employees, if you’re able to be in a situation, if you serve people, you have plexiglass dividers, the whole range. If you’re able to have everybody with a mask and the like, you can do so much to save but you don’t get that direction. So the money I guarantee you is going to go to small businesses with people and I’m shooting, and by the way the original definition of the small business is 500 or fewer employees. Well, that’s not what I mean by small businesses. What we meant by small businesses, the mom and pop business is the whole communities together and keep people together, and particularly in neighborhoods where if you don’t have a beauty shop, a barber shop, a hardware store, a grocery store, et cetera, the center of the community begins to disintegrate some. What I like to do is if you are willing to give me an address, to lay out for you precisely without taking more time, I’m going to get into trouble I’m supposed to only talk two minutes in an answer, is to let you know exactly how that $60 billion in part of the recovery package will go to small businesses. All right. We’re going to take a quick break. When we get back we’ll have more questions for the president of the United States, Joe Biden. We’ll be right back. And welcome back. We’re live at a CNN Town Hall event at the Pabst Theater in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, with President Joe Biden. We are back, thanks so much for being here. Before we get back into the audience I wanted to ask just a question about what we just witnessed. Before the Senate voted to acquit the former president in the impeachment trial you said you were anxious to see if Republican senators would stand up, only seven did. House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi called the rest cowards. I’m not going to call names out. Look, for four years all that’s been in the news is Trump. In the next four years I want to make sure all the news is the American people, I’m tired for an option. It’s time. Senator Minority Leader, Mitch McConnell, said that the former president is “Still liable for everything he did while he was in office. I made it clear, one of the most serious pieces of damage done by the last administration was the politicizing of the Justice Department. And if you who are lawyers know, whether you’re a Democrat, Republican, conservative, or liberal, it has been more politicized than any Justice Department in American history. … Ever tell my justice department, and it’s not mine, it’s the people’s justice department, who they should and should not prosecute. Their prosecutorial decision to be left to the justice department. Not me. I’d want you to meet Joel Berkowitz from Shorewood. He’s a Democrat, a professor of foreign languages and literature at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. Joel, thanks for being here. Thank you, Anderson. Good evening, Mr. President. I’m not bad at the literature part, but after five years of French, I still can’t speak a word, so I apologize. Hey, by the way, I understand a little bit of Yiddish. I’m sure you do. It would be a shonda if he didn’t, but. More seriously, Mr. President, like millions of my fellow citizens, I was shaken by the attack on the Capitol on January 6th, and on our democracy more broadly, by your predecessor and his followers. While I appreciate efforts being made to bring them to justice, I worry about ongoing threats to our country from Americans who embrace white supremacy and conspiracies that align with it. It’s complex, it’s wide-ranging and it’s real. I got involved in politics to begin with because of civil rights and opposition to white supremacist, the Klu Klux Klan, and the most dangerous people in America continue to exist. That is the greatest threat to terror in America, domestic terror. And so I would make sure that my justice department and the civil rights division is focused heavily on those very folks. And I would make sure that we, in fact, focus on how to deal with the rise of white supremacy. And you see what’s happening in the studies that are beginning to be done, maybe at your university as well, about the impact of former military, former police officers on the growth of white supremacy in some of these groups. You may remember in one of my debates with the former president, I asked him to condemn the Proud Boys. He wouldn’t do it. He said, “Stand by, stand ready.” Or whatever the phrase exactly was. It is a bane on our existence. It has always been. As Lincoln said, “We have to appeal to our better angels.” And these guys are not, and women, are in fact demented. They are dangerous people. I want you to meet James Lewis, an Independent from Milwaukee. He’s a labor attorney. James, welcome. All right. You’re all right. You’re as big as a mountain. Good evening, President Biden. I was a public defender in Kenosha County when the police shot Jacob Blake. I witnessed the city I worked in burned and devastated. And recently, District Attorney Michael Graveley denied to prosecute the police officers responsible. Three things. First of all, I was a public defender as well. And I think it’s high time that we had public defenders being paid the same as prosecutors. My son, by the way, was a great prosecutor. He was the Attorney General of the State of Delaware, and he was a federal prosecutor before that. And so I’m not condemning all prosecutors, but I am saying that it matters that you have adequate defense and you are able to attract people who, in fact, can live on being able to be that public defender. Number one. Number two, we are pushing very hard, and I think we’ll get it done, is the legislation relating to what is appropriate police behavior, and studying police behavior, and coming down with recommendations that are consistent with the legislation that was put in place as a consequence of all the world seeing one man shoved up against the curb and murdered after eight minutes and 46 seconds. And so there’s a number of things relating to everything from no-knock warrants and a whole range of things you know. There’s legislation that’s being introduced, separately. I hope it will pass. But thirdly, I think we have to deal with systemic racism that exists throughout society. And one of the things I’m going to recommend there, is that we look at an entire panoply of things that affect whether or not people of color, primarily, are treated differently. And that goes for everything from prosecutorial discretion. You know as a public defender, and well, by that I mean, what happens is … It will take too long to go through the whole explanation, but let me try to do it quickly. What happens now is, if you in fact are and going to … you arrest someone because they had … and you want to charge them. You can charge them with robbery or armed robbery. You charge them with armed robbery, you get a lot more time than if you don’t charge with robbery. But if you want to make sure that someone who doesn’t know much about their representation is able to … you engage in prosecutorial misconduct by offering them to plead to essentially … It’s not the same. Burglary, which gets them two years and probation. And so you don’t even get a trial. You plead because you don’t have [inaudible 00:41:42] representation. You feel like everything’s again you, and you’re in trouble. When I did the sentencing act that was designed to keep, make sure we had the same time for the same crime. As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I’d looked at all 10 federal districts, and we took six months to do it, and found out if you’re black and you were your first time offense of being accused of burglary, and maybe you committed it, and you were white, and you did the same exact crime, in all 10 districts throughout the United States of America, the person … and don’t hold me to the exact numbers, but the percentages is right. If you’re a first-time white guy, you’d get two years. You get seven years if you’re black. So, in order to make sure that you could not send people to jail for the same crime, I came up with this sentencing commission, which said that everybody who commits the crime has to receive between instead of zero to 20 years, you drastically cut down the number of years you could go to jail, but say you have to, if you’re, it’s a one first-time offense, you have to get sentenced between one and a half and three years. But what happens is prosecutors use that as a mechanism to send people to jail, and it makes it look like they were dealing with mandatory sentencing, which it wasn’t designed to do at all. It’s designed to make sure that people were treated fairly. There’s much more, I’m sorry to go on. We actually have a related question over here. This is Dannie Evans, a pastor in Janesville who works as a supervisor for the Juvenile Justice Diversion Program in Rock County. He’s an Independent, voted for Donald Trump in 2020. He’s also a member of the state’s 32 member Racial Disparity Task Force created in the wake of the Jacob Blake shooting last summer. Dannie, welcome. Good afternoon, Mr. President. Defund the police is discussed as an option for reforming policing. However, there are communities where people live in fear, not of the police, but in fear of the violent gangs who commit crimes in those neighborhoods. By number one, not defunding the police. We have to put more money in police work, so we have legitimate community policing and we’re in a situation where we changed the legislation. No one should go to jail for a drug offense. No one should go to jail for the use of a drug. They should go to drug rehabilitation. Drug rehabilitation, number one. We should be in a position where we change the system of sentencing system to one that relates to a notion of … think they’re telling you that … is related to making sure that what you do is you focus on making sure that there’s rehabilitation. The idea that we don’t have people in prison systems learning how to be spending the money, learning how to be mechanics, learning how to be cooks, learning how to have a profession when you get out. The idea that we deny someone who served their time access to Pell grants, access to housing, access to … Right now, as you well know, most places you get out of prison, you get 25 bucks and a bus ticket. You end up back under the bridge exactly where you were before. And the fact is that the concern in many minority communities is black on black, Hispanic on Hispanic, not just … but here’s the deal. There has to be much more serious … How can I say it? Much more serious determination as to what the background and the attitudes of the recruit is, what their views are. There should be much more psychological testing, like you would if you go into the intelligence community. What is it? What are the things that make you respond the way you do? Because there is inherent prejudice built into the system as well. And we also need to provide for, and it’s happening, more African-American and more Hispanic police officers. Now, by the way, they don’t get it all right either by a long shot. But every cop, when they get up in the morning and put on that shield has a right to expect to be able to go home to their family that night. Conversely, every kid walking across the street wearing a hoodie is not a member of a gang and is about to knock somebody off. So, it’s about education. I’d love to talk to you more about it because it is the answer in my view, that and education. Actually, access to education. And one of the things that I talk a lot about, and I’m sorry to go on about this, but it’s important, I don’t think we can look at our opportunity, and let’s stick with the African-American community for a minute. In terms of the criminal justice system, that is only one small piece of why people are the way they are. You realize, I don’t know what home you live in, but if you go ahead and you want to get insurance and you’re in a black neighborhood, you’re going to pay more for the same insurance I’m going to pay for the exact same home. Your car, you never had an accident in your car. You live in a black neighborhood, you’re going to pay a higher premium in your car. You’re going to … so there’s so many things that are built in institutionally that disadvantaged African-Americans and Latinos that, in fact, I think, and one of the great advantages … I’m sorry to go on, but one of the great advantages, as bad as things are, I keep reading from presidential historians how I’ve inherited the worst situation since Lincoln, worse than Roosevelt because economic crisis, political crisis, racial crisis, et cetera. But the fact is that everyone’s gotten a close-up look now and seeing what’s happened. That kid, that kid holding that camera for eight minutes and 46 seconds awakened the whole world. When I met with his little daughter after he was dead, she said, “My daddy changed the world.” Guess what? Not only here in the United States, around the world, people said, “Whoa, I didn’t know that happened. Dr. King, when my generation, when I got involved in the civil rights movement as a high school student in the early sixties, and you had Bull Connor and his dogs in the late fifties, singing on those ladies going in their black dresses, going to church, and little kids, and fire hoses ripping their skin off. He said, “What happened there was it was a second emancipation.” Because people in places where there weren’t black communities said, “That really happens? I didn’t believe it.” They saw it happen. And so it generated the Voting Rights Act. It generated Civil Rights Act and he called the Second Emancipation. We have a chance now, a chance now to make significant change in racial disparities. And I’m going to say something’s going to get me in trouble, which couldn’t go through a whole show without doing that. And that is that, think about it. If you want to know where the American public is, look at the money being spent in advertising. Did you ever, five years ago, think every second or third ad out of five or six you’d turn on would be biracial couples? No, no, I’m not being facetious. The reason I’m so hopeful is this new generation. They’re not like us. They’re thinking differently. They’re more open. And we’ve got to take advantage of it. I’m sorry. I want you to meet LuVerda Martin, a Democrat from Mequon. Mequon. Mequon, sorry. LuVerda is a certified nurse midwife, but welcome. Good evening, Mr. President. Good evening. Our nation’s experiences with and through COVID-19 and other recent tragedies have strengthened the foundation of division among Americans. I take issue with what everybody says about the division. For example, my plan on COVID. 69% of the American people support it. 69. In this state, a recent poll, 60%. 60%. 45% of Trump voters and 55% of Republican voters. The nation is not divided. You go out there and take a look and talk to people. You have fringes on both ends, but it’s not nearly as divided as we make it out to be. And we have to bring it together. You may remember the trouble I get in. I said there were three reasons I was running. One to restore the soul of the country, decency, honor, integrity. Talk about the things that mattered to people, treat people with dignity. Secondly, I said to rebuilt the backbone of the country, the middle-class and this time bring everybody along and have a chance. And the third reason was to unite the country. On my own primary, I got, “Unite the country? What are you talking about?” You cannot function in our system without consensus, other than abusing power at the executive level. So, I really think there’s so many things that we agree on that we don’t focus enough on. And that’s in large part, I think because we don’t just condemn the things that are so obviously wrong, obviously wrong, that everybody agrees on. The way they were raised. The way we were raised. As my mother would say, if half the things that occurred in the last campaign came out of my mouth, then she’d say as a kid, we’d wash my mouth out with soap. I mean, we have to be more decent and treat people with respect. And just decency. Let me ask about a question which does often divide many people in this country, immigration. Yes. Your administration, along with congressional Democrats expected to unveil an immigration reform bill just this week. You want a pathway to citizenship for the roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants. Yeah, there’s a whole range of things that relate to immigration, including the whole idea, how you deal with … what confuses people is you talk about refugees. You talk about undocumented. You talk about people who are seeking asylum, and you talk about people who are coming from camps or being held around the world. And there are four different criteria for being able to come to the United States. The vast majority of the people, the 11 million undocumented, they’re not Hispanics. There are people who came on a Visa, who was able to buy a ticket to get in a plane and didn’t go home. They didn’t come across the Rio Grande, swimming. Excuse me. Sorry. Sorry. It’s the Irish in me. But all kidding aside. So, there are a lot of things that relate, but I think that we can no long … look you’ve heard, even if you’re not involved in politics at all, you’ve probably heard me say this a thousand times and matter fact, everyone is entitled to be treated with decency, with dignity. Everyone is entitled to that. And we don’t do that now for the first time in American history. If you’re seeking asylum, meaning you’re being persecuted, you’re seeking asylum, you can’t do it from the United States. You used to come, have an asylum officer determine whether or not you met the criteria, and send you back if you, in fact, but you can’t even do that. You got to seek asylum from abroad. … from abroad. But just to be clear though, I know you’re going to be announcing stuff later this week, or that’s what I’ve heard. Yes. … for roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants, and that would be essential in any bill for you. Well, yes. But by the way, if you came along and said to me, in the meantime, “We can work out a system whereby we’re going to… For example, we used to allow refugees, 125,000 refugees, into the United States in a yearly basis. It was as high as 250,000. Trump cut it to 5,000. Come with me into Sierra Leone, come with me into parts of Lebanon, come with me around the world and see people piled up in camps, kids dying, no way out, refugees fleeing from persecution. We, the United States used to do our part. We were part of that. That’s, send me your huddled masses. Come on. And so I would, if you had a refugee bill by itself, I’m not suggesting that, but there’s things that I would deal by itself, but not at the expense of saying I’m never going to do the other. There is a reasonable path to citizenship and it shows up… One of the reasons why we have been able to compete with the rest of the world so well is most of our major competitors are xenophobic. I remember you questioned me when I came back from China and I said, “I predict within less than a year, they’re going to end their One-China policy.” And I got clobbered by saying… Because they said, “Biden didn’t talk about the fact that how immoral it was.” And it was when we were running against the Republican ticket, led by Mitt Romney, a fine guy. Yes, for two hours. We must speak up for human rights. It’s who we are. My comment to him was, and I know him well, and he knows me well. We are two our conversation. I talked about this too, and that’s not so much refugee, but I talked about it. I said, “Look… Chinese leaders, if you know anything about Chinese history, it has always been the time when China has been victimized by the outer world is when they haven’t been unified at home. So the central… Vastly overstated. The central principle of Xi Jinping is that there must be a united tightly-controlled China. And he uses his rationale for the things he does based on that. I pointed out to him, no American president can be sustained as a president if he doesn’t reflect the values of the United States. And so the idea, I’m not going to speak out against what he’s doing in Hong Kong, what he’s doing with the Uyghurs in Western mountains of China and Taiwan, the One-China policy by making it forceful. I said, and… He said… He gets it. Culturally, there are different norms at each country and their leaders are expected to follow. But my point was that when I came back from meeting with him and traveling 17,000 miles with him, when I was vice-president and he was the vice-president, and that’s how I got to know him so well, at the request of President Hu. Not a joke, not a joke. His predecessor, President Hu and President Obama wanted us to get to know one another because he was going to be the president. And I came back and said, “They’re going to end their one child policy, because they’re so xenophobic, they won’t let anybody else in, and more people are retired than working. Well, there will be repercussions for China and he knows that. What I’m doing is making clear that we in fact, are going to continue to reassert our role as spokespersons for human rights at the UN and other agencies that have an impact on their attitude. China is trying very hard to become the world leader and to get that moniker and to be able to do that they have to gain the confidence of other countries. And as long as they’re engaged in activity that is contrary to basic human rights, it’s going to be hard for them to do that. But it’s much more complicated. I shouldn’t to try to talk China policy in 10 minutes on television. Well, let me bring it back to the United States. I want you to meet Jocelyn Fish, a democrat from Racine. Jocelyn is a director of marketing for a community theater. Jocelyn, welcome. Your question. Hello. Good evening, Mr. President. Good evening. Student loans are crushing my family, friends and fellow Americans. Me too. You think I’m kidding. But how can we fulfill that dream when debt is many people’s only option for a degree? We need student loan forgiveness beyond the potential $10,000 your administration has a proposed. We need at least a $50,000 minimum. I will not make that happen. It depends on whether or not you go to a private university or public university. It depends on the idea that I say to a community, I’m going to forgive the debt, the billions of dollars of debt for people who have gone to Harvard, and Yale, and Penn, and schools my children. I went to a great school. I went to a state school. But here’s what I think. I think everyone, and I’ve been proposing this for four years, everyone should be able to go to community college for free, for free. That costs $9 billion, and we should pay for it. Instagram the tax policies we have now, we should be able to pay for it. You spend almost that money as a break for people who own race horses. And I think any family making under $125,000, whose kids go to a state university they get into, that should be free as well. And the thing I do in terms of student debt that’s accumulated is provide for changing the existing system now, for debt forgiveness if you engage in volunteer activity. For example, if you’re teaching school, after five years, you’d have $50,000 of your debt forgiven. If you worked in a battered woman’s shelter, if you worked in so on, so you’ll be able to forgive debt. Thirdly, I am going to change the position that we have now to allow for debt forgiveness because it’s so hard to calculate, whereby you can now, depending on how much you make and what program you sought, you can work off that debt by the activity you have, and you can not be charged more than X percent of your take-home pay, so that it doesn’t affect your ability to buy a car, own a home, et cetera. Each of my children graduated from school. I mortgaged the house. I was listed as the poorest man in Congress, not a joke, for over 30 years. But I bought a home I spent a lot of time working on, and I was able to sell it for some profit. But my oldest son graduated after undergraduate and graduate school with $136,000 in debt, after working 30 hours a week during school. My other son had went to Georgetown and Yale Law School, graduated $142,000 in debt. And he worked for the parking service down in Washington. My daughter went to Tulane University and then got a master’s at Penn. She graduated a $103,000 in debt. So I don’t think anybody should have to pay for that, but I do think you should be able to work it off. My daughter’s a social worker. My other son ran the World Food Program USA, and so on. They didn’t qualify. But my point is I understand the impact of the debt and it can be debilitating. And I think there’s a whole question about what universities are doing. They don’t need more sky boxes. What they need is more money invested in making… That’s why I provide, for example, $70 billion over 10 years for HBCUs, and other minority-serving universities, because they don’t have the laboratories to be able to bring in those government contracts, that can train people in cyber security or other future endeavors that pay well. But I do think that in this moment of economic pain and strain, that we should be eliminating interest on the debts that are accumulated, number one. And number two, I’m prepared to write off the $10,000 debt, but not 50. Mr. Because I don’t think I have the authority to do [inaudible 01:03:37]. Over the years, over your career, you’ve already spent a great deal of time at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, except now you’re living there and you’re President. It’s been four weeks. I get up in the morning and look at Jill and say, “Where the hell are we?” No. Look, I’ve only been president four weeks and sometimes because things are moving so fast, not because of burden, it feels like four years. It’s not because of the burden. It’s because there’s so much happening that you’re constantly focusing on one problem or opportunity ad seriatim. But what happens is that it’s… What I didn’t realize, I had been in the oval office 100 times as vice-president or more than that, every morning for the initial meetings, but I had never been up in the residence. One of the things that, I don’t know about you all, but I was raised in a way that you didn’t look for anybody to wait on you. And it’s where I find myself extremely self-conscious. You’d never been in the residence of the White House. I only been upstairs in yellow room, the Oval upstairs. I don’t know. I’ve never been there either. But look, the people down there are wonderful and I find that like my dad, you’ve heard me say this before. My dad used to say, “Everybody, everybody’s entitled to be treated with respect.” It’s interesting how decent and incredible these folks are. I don’t know what I ever expected it to be. It is different in that… Get in trouble here. I said when I was running, I want it to be president, not to live in the White House, but to be able to make the decisions about the future of the country. And so living in the White House, as you’ve heard other presidents who have been extremely flattered to live there, it’s a little like a gilded cage in terms of being able to walk outside and do things. The vice-president’s residence was totally different. You’re on 80 acres, overlooking the rest of the city, and you can walk out, there’s a swimming pool. You go walk off a porch in the summer and jump in a pool, and go into work. You can ride a bicycle around and never leave the property, and work out. But the White House is very different. And I feel a sense of, I must tell you, a sense of history about it. Jon Meacham, who you know, and several other presidential historians helped me with my… I asked my brother, who’s good at this, to set up the Oval Office for me. Because it all happens within two hours, literally. They move everything out and move something in. It was interesting to hear these historians talk about what other presidents have gone through, and the moments, and who were the people who stepped up to the ball, and who’s the people that didn’t. What you realize is, the most consequential thing for me is although I’ve known this, watching seven presidents who I got to know fairly well, is I always in the past, looked at the presidency in the terms of Abraham Lincoln, and Franklin Roosevelt, and George Washington. They’re superhuman. But I had to remind myself that they’re really fine men that I knew well, the last seven presidents. And at least they’re people who I knew well enough to know that I could play on the same team with. So it took away the sense of this is, “My God, I’m not Abraham Lincoln, I’m not Franklin Roosevelt. I have. No, I don’t. They’re private conversations. But by the way, all of them have, with one exception, picked up the phone and call me as well. I know you don’t want to talk about him. No, but look, it’s the greatest honor I think an American can be given, from my perspective. And I literally pray that I have the capacity to do for the country what you all deserve need to be done. But one thing I learned after eight years with Barack is no matter how consequential the decision, I got to be the last person in the room with him literally, on every decision. I can make a recommendation, but I walked out of the room and it was all him, man. Nobody else, the buck stops there. And that’s when you pray for a making sure you’re looking at the impact on the country and a little bit of good luck at the judgment you’re making. Mr. President, thank you so much for joining us in this town hall. Thank you. We want to thank our audience for being here, for their questions. We also want thank the…"
"25","02-19-21"," It’s great to be with Angela and Emanuel. We just spent a part of, from Washington perspective, a morning together. But I want to say hello to everyone, and thanks to you at the Munich Conference for hosting this special session. For decades, as you pointed out, I participated in the Munich Security Conference as a U.S. senator joining my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to affirm the importance of the Transatlantic Partnership. Three times as vice-president of the United States, including delivering the first international foreign policy address of the Obama-Biden administration in the first months we were in office. And two years ago, as you pointed out, when I last spoke in Munich, I was a private citizen. I was a professor, not an elected official. But I said at that time, “We will be back.” And I’m a man of my word. America is back. I speak to you today as president of the United States, at the very start of my administration; and I’m sending a clear message to the world, America is back. The Transatlantic Alliance is back. And we are not looking backward, we are looking forward together. It comes down to this, the Transatlantic Alliance is a strong foundation, the strong foundation in which our collective security and our shared prosperity are built. The partnership between Europe and the United States in my view is, and must remain the cornerstone of all that we hope to accomplish in the 21st century, just as we did in the 20th century. The challenges we face today are different. We’re at an inflection point. When I spoke to you as a senator and as even as vice-president, the global dynamics have shifted, new crises demand our attention, and we can not focus only on the competition among countries that threaten to divide the world, or only on global challenges that threaten to sink us all together if we fail to cooperate. We must do both, working in lock step with our allies and partners. So let me erase any lingering doubt. The United States will work closely with our European Union partners in the capitals across the continent, from Rome, to Riga, to meet the range of shared challenges we face. We continue to support the goal of a Europe whole, and free, and at peace. The United States is fully committed to our NATO Alliance; and I welcome Europe’s growing investment in the military capabilities that enable our shared defense. To me, and to the United States, and us, we’ll keep faith with Article 5; it’s a guarantee. An attack on one is an attack on all, that is our unshakeable vow. And the only time Article 5 has been invoked was after the United States was attacked on 9/11. You, our allies joined us to fight Al-Qaida, and the United States committed to consulting closely with our NATO allies and partners on the way forward in Afghanistan. My administration strongly supports the diplomatic process that’s underway, and to bring an end to this war that is closing out 20 years. We remain committed to ensuring that Afghanistan never again provides a base for terrorist attacks against the United States and our partners and our interests. Our European partners have also stood with us to counter ISIS. Just this wee NATO defense ministers endorsed significant expanded training and advisory mission in Iraq, which will be vital to the ongoing fight against ISIS. We cannot allow ISIS to reopen and regroup and threaten people in the Middle East, and Europe, and the United States and elsewhere. And while the United States is undergoing a thorough review of our own force posture around the world, I’ve ordered the halting and withdrawal of American troops from Germany. I’m also lifting the cap imposed by the previous administration on the number of us forces able to be based in Germany. I know the past few years have strained and tested our transatlantic relationship, but the United States is determined, determined to re-engage with Europe, to consult with you, to earn back our position of trusted leadership. Earlier today, as was referenced, I participated in the first meeting of the G7 leaders, where I spoke about the dire need to coordinate multilateral action to address COVID-19, the global economic crisis, and the accelerating climate crisis, and so much else. Achieving these goals is going to depend on a core strategic proposition. And that is the United States must renew America’s enduring advantages so that we can meet today’s challenges from a position of strength. That means building back better our economic foundations, reclaiming our place in international institutions, lifting up our values at home, and speaking out to defend them around the world, modernizing our military capabilities while leading with diplomacy, revitalizing America’s network of alliances and partnerships that have made the world safer for all people. I hope our fellow democracies are going to join us in this vital work. Our partnerships have endured and grown through the years because they are rooted in the richness of our shared democratic values. They’re not transactional, they’re not extractive. They’re built on a vision of a future where every voice matters, where the rights of all are protected, and the rule of law is upheld. None of us has fully succeeded in this division. We continue to work toward it. And in so many places, including in Europe and the United States, democratic progress is under assault. I’ve known many of you for a long, long time, and you know that I speak my mind. So let me be very straightforward with you all. We are in the midst of a fundamental debate about the future and direction of our world. We’re at an inflection point between those who argue that given all the challenges we face from the fourth industrial revolution, to the global pandemic, that autocracy is the best way forward they argue. And those who understand that democracy is essential, essential to meeting these challenges. Historians are going to examine and write about this moment as an inflection point, as I said. And I believe in every ounce of my bead that democracy will and must prevail. We must demonstrate that democracy can still deliver for our people in this changed world. That in my view, is our galvanizing mission. Democracy doesn’t happen by accident. We have to defend it, fight for it, strengthen it, renew it. We have to prove that our model isn’t a relic of history; it’s the single best way to revitalize the promise of our future. And if we work together with our democratic partners, with strength and confidence, I know we’ll meet every challenge and outpace every challenger. We must prepare together for long-term strategic competition with China. How the United States, Europe and Asia work together to secure the peace, and defend our shared values, and advance our prosperity across the Pacific will be among the most consequential efforts we undertake. Competition with China is going to be stiff; that’s what I expect, and that’s what I welcome. Because I believe in the global system, Europe and the United States together, with our allies in the Indo-Pacific worked so hard to build over the last 70 years. We can own the race for the future, but to do so we have to be clear-eyed about the historic investments and partnerships that this will require. We have to protect for space for innovation, for intellectual property, and the creative genius that thrives with the free exchange of ideas in open democratic societies. We have to ensure that the benefits of growth are shared broadly and equitably, not just by a few. We have to push back against the Chinese government’s economic abuses and coercion that undercut the foundations of the international economic system. Everyone must play by the same rules. U.S. and European companies are required to publicly disclose to corporate governance structures, and abide by rules to deter corruption of monopolistic practices. Chinese companies should be held to the same standard. We must shape the rules that will govern the advance of technology and the norms of behavior in cyberspace, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, so that they are used to lift people up, not used to pin them down. We must stand up for the democratic values that make it possible for us to accomplish any of this, pushing back against those who would monopolize and normalize repression. Now this is also how we’re going to be able to meet the threat from Russia. The criminal attacks our democracies and weaponizes corruption to try to undermine our system of governance. Russian leaders want people to think that our system is more corrupt, or as corrupt as theirs; but the world knows that isn’t true, including Russia’s own citizens. Putin seeks to weaken the European project, and our NATO Alliance. He wants to undermine the transatlantic unity and our resolve, because it’s so much easier for the Kremlin to bully and threaten individual states than it is to negotiate with a strong and closely-united transatlantic community. That’s why standing up for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine remains a vital concern for Europe and the United States. That’s why addressing Russian recklessness, and hacking into computer networks in the United States and across Europe and the world has become critical to protecting our collective security. The challenges with Russia may be different than the ones with China, but they’re just as real. It is not about pitting East against West. It’s not about, we want a conflict. We want a future where all nations are able to freely determine their own path without a threat of violence or coercion. We cannot and must not return to the reflective opposition and rigid blocks of the cold war. Competition must not lock out cooperation on issues that affect us all. For example, we must cooperate if we’re going to defeat COVID-19 everywhere. My first presidential national security memorandum focused on surging health and humanitarian responses to defeat COVID-19, and to better prevent and prepare for the next pandemic. Today, I’m announcing that the United States is making a $2 billion pledge to COVAX with a promise of an additional $2 billion to urge others to step up as well. And even as we fight to get out of the teeth of this pandemic, the resurgence of Ebola in Africa is a stark reminder that we must simultaneously work to finally finance health security, strengthen global health systems, and create early warning systems to prevent, detect, and respond to future biological threats because they will keep coming. We have to work together to strengthen and reform the World Health Organization. We need a UN system focused on biological threats that can move quickly to trigger action. Similarly, we can no longer delay or do the bare minimum to address climate change. This is a global existential crisis, and we’ll all suffer, we’ll all suffer the consequences if we fail. We have to rapidly accelerate our commitments to aggressively curb our emissions and to hold one another accountable for meeting our goals, and increasing our ambitions. That’s why as president, I immediately rejoined the Paris Agreement. And as of today, the United States is officially, once again, a party to the Paris Agreement, which we helped put together. On earth day I will host the leaders’ summit to help drive more ambitious actions among the top emitters, including domestic climate action here in the United States. I’m grateful for Europe’s continued leadership on climate issues over the last four years. Together, we need to invest in the technological innovations that are going to power our clean energy futures, and enable us to build a clean energy solution to global markets. The threat of nuclear proliferation also continues to require careful diplomacy and cooperation among us. We need transparency and communication to minimize the risk of strategic misunderstanding or mistakes. That’s why the United States and Russia, not withstanding other competition, extended the New START treaty for an additional four years once I was sworn in. That’s why we said we’re prepared to reengage in negotiations with the P5+1 on Iran’s nuclear program. We must also address Iran’s destabilizing activities across the Middle East, and we’re going to work in close cooperation with our European and other partners as we proceed. We’ll also work together to lock down fissile and radiologic material, to prevent terrorist groups from acquiring and using it. The range of challenges Europe in the United States must take on together is broad and complex. I’m eager to hear next from my good friends and outstanding leaders, Chancellor Merkel about her thoughts on the way forward together. So let me conclude with this. We cannot allow self-doubt to hinder our ability to engage each other, or the larger world. The last four years have been hard, but Europe and United States have to lead with confidence once more, with faith in our capacities, a commitment to our own renewal, with trust in one another, and the ability Europe in the United States to meet any challenge to secure our futures together. I know we can do this. We’ve done it before. Just yesterday, after a seven month, 300 million mile journey, NASA successfully landed the Perseverance Rover on Mars. It’s on a mission of exploration, with elements contributed by our European partners, to seek evidence of the possibility of life beyond our planet, and the mysteries of the universe. Over the next few years, Percy, as it’s being called, but Perseverance will range and collect samples from the red planet, and pile them up so another mission and rover, envisioned as a joint effort between NASA and the European Space Agency, will retrieve this trove of scientific wanders and bring it home to all of us. That’s what we can do together. If our unbound capacities to carry us to Mars and back don’t tell us anything else, they tell us we can meet any challenge we can face on earth. We have everything we need. And I want you to know the United States will do our part. We’ll stand with you. We’ll fight for our shared values. We’ll meet the challenges of this new moment in history, America’s back. So let’s get together and demonstrate to our great, great grandchildren when they read about us, that democracy, democracy, democracy functions and works, and together there’s nothing we can’t do. So let’s get working. Thank you all very much."
"26","02-20-20"," Good evening everyone. I’m Lester Holt. Welcome to Las Vegas. Everything is on the line tonight, with just three days before the critical Nevada caucuses. Here with me on the stage tonight, NBC News Political Director and moderator of Meet the Press, Chuck Todd. And NBC News Chief White House correspondent and MSNBC anchor, Hallie Jackson. Also joining us is Telemundo’s Senior Correspondent, Vanessa Hauc. And editor of the Nevada Independent Jon Ralston, who has covered Nevada politics for more than three decades. The rules are this tonight, candidates will get a minute 15 to answer each question and 45 seconds for followups. Now that the stage has narrowed to six candidates, we encourage each of you to directly engage with each other on the issues. So let’s get to our first question. Since the last time you all shared the stage, Senator Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, has surged into the lead nationally in the democratic race. And there’s a new person on the stage tonight, Mayor Michael Bloomberg. A former Republican who spent millions of his own dollars to run in this race. What hasn’t changed? A majority of democratic voters still say their top priority is beating President Trump. Senator Sanders, the first question to you, Mayor Bloomberg is pitching himself as a centrist who says he’s best positioned to win in November. In order to beat Donald Trump, we’re going to need the largest voter turnout in the history of the United States. Mr. Bloomberg had policies in New York city of stop-and-frisk, which went after African American and Latino people in an outrageous way. That is not a way you’re going to grow voter turnout. What our movement is about is bringing working class people together, black and white and Latino, Native American, Asian American, around an agenda that works for all of us and not just the billionaire class. And that agenda says that maybe, just maybe, we should join the rest of the industrialized world, guarantee healthcare to all people as a human right, raise that minimum wage to a living wage of 15 bucks an hour. And have the guts to take on the fossil fuel industry, because their short term profits are not more important than the future of this planet and the need to combat climate change. Those are some of the reasons we have the strongest campaign to defeat Donald Trump. I don’t think there’s any chance of the Senator beating President Trump. You don’t start out by saying, “I’ve got 160 million people, I’m going to take away the insurance plan that they love.” That’s just not a ways that you go and start building the coalition that the Sanders’ camp thinks that they can do. I don’t think there’s any chance whatsoever, and if he goes and is the candidate, we will have Donald Trump for another four years and we can’t stand that. Senator Warren. I’d like to talk about who we’re running against. A billionaire who calls women fat broads and horse faced lesbians. And no, I’m not talking about Donald Trump, I’m talking about mayor Bloomberg. Democrats are not going to win if we have a nominee who has a history of hiding his tax returns, of harassing women and of supporting racist policies like redlining and stop-and-frisk. Look, I’ll support whoever the democratic nominee is, but understand this, Democrats take a huge risk if we just substitute one arrogant billionaire for another. This country has worked for the rich for a long time and left everyone else in the dirt. It is time to have a president who will be on the side of working families and be willing to get out there and fight for them. That is why I am in this race and that is how I will beat Donald Trump. I think the path is a high voter turnout. I’m the one on this stage that had the highest voter turnout of any state in the country, when I led the tip ticket. As well as bringing in rural and suburban voters and I’ve done that as well. And I’m the only one with the receipts to have done that in Republican congressional districts over and over again. But I want to say this, I actually welcomed Mayor Bloomberg to the stage. I thought that he shouldn’t be hiding behind his TV ads, and so I was already for this big day. And then I looked at the memo from his campaign staff this morning and it said that he actually thought that three of us should get out of the way. That is what his campaign said, because we should pave the way for him to become the nominee. I have been told as a woman, as someone that maybe no one thought was still going to be standing up on this stage, but I am because of pure grit and because of the people out there. I’ve been told many times to wait my turn and to step aside and I’m not going to do that now and I’m not going to do that because a campaign memo from Mayor Bloomberg said this morning that the only way that we get a nominee is if we step aside for him. I think we need something different than Donald Trump. I don’t think you look at Donald Trump and say, we need someone richer in the white house. Thank you. Mayor Bloomberg, there’s a lot for you to respond to there, so here’s your opportunity. I think we have two questions to face tonight. One is, who can beat Donald Trump? And number two, who can do the job if they get into the White House? And I would argue that I am candidate that can do exactly both of those things. I’m a New Yorker. I know how to take on an arrogant con man like Donald Trump that comes from New York. I’m a mayor. I was a mayor. I know how to run a complicated city, the biggest, most diverse city in this country. I’m a manager. I knew what to do after 9-11 and brought the city back stronger than ever. And I’m a philanthropist who didn’t inherit his money, but made his money. And I’m spending that money to get rid of Donald Trump, the worst President we have ever had. And if I can get that done, it will be a great contribution to America and to my kids. Vice President Biden, I’ll let you weigh in there. In terms who can beat Donald Trump, NBC did a poll yesterday, says Joe Biden is best equipped to beat Donald Trump. That’s what your poll said. And it said that I can beat him in those toss up states too, those states we have to win. I’m ahead by eight points across the board. So in terms of being able to beat Donald Trump, I’m better positioned according to your poll than anybody else to beat Donald Trump, number one. Number two, the Mayor makes an interesting point. The mayor says that he has a great record, that he’s done these wonderful things. Well the fact of the matter is, he has not managed his city very, very well when he was there. He didn’t get a whole lot done. He has stop-and-frisk, throwing close to 5 million young black men up against a wall. And when we came along in our administration, President Obama and said, “We’re going to send in a mediator to stop it.” He said, “That’s unnecessary.” So we’re going to get a chance to talk about the mayor’s record, but in terms of who is best prepared to beat Donald Trump, look at your poll and what it says. Mayor Buttigieg, you’d like to weigh in. Yes, we’ve got to wake up as a party. We could wake up two weeks from today, the day after super Tuesday, and the only candidates left standing will be Bernie Sanders and Mike Bloomberg, the two most polarizing figures on this stage. And most Americans don’t see where they fit, if they’ve got to choose between a socialist who thinks that capitalism is the root of all evil and a billionaire who thinks that money ought to be the root of all power. Let’s put forward somebody who actually lives and works in a middle-class neighborhood, in an industrial Midwestern city. Let’s put forward somebody who’s actually a Democrat. Look, we shouldn’t have to choose between one candidate who wants to burn this party down and another candidate who wants to buy this party out. We can do better. If speaking to the needs and the pain of a long neglected working class is polarizing, I think you got the wrong word. What we are trying finally to do, is to give a voice to people who have to 45 years of work are not making a nickel more than they did 45 years ago. We are giving a voice to people who are saying we are sick of tired of billionaires like Mr. Bloomberg seeing huge expansions of their wealth, while a half a million people sleep out on the street tonight. And that’s what we are saying, Pete, is maybe it’s a time for the working class of this country to have a little bit of power in Washington rather than your billionaire campaign contributors. All right. Including 46 billionaires. Among the hundreds of thousands of contributors. And look, we’ve got to unite this country to deal with these issues. You’re not the only one who cares about the working class. Most Americans believe we need to empower workers. As a matter of fact, you’re the one who is at war with the Culinary Union right here in Las Vegas. We are more union support than you have ever dreamed of. We have the support of unions all across this country. Yeah but the vision I’m putting forward has the support of the American people. Really. We can actually deliver healthcare without taking it away from anyone. Senator Warren, I have a question for you. On Sunday, on Meet the Press, Vice President Biden accused Senator Sanders supporters of bullying union leaders here with, “Vicious, malicious misogynistic things.” You said Democrats cannot build an inclusive party on a foundation of hate. Look, I have said many times before, we are all responsible for our supporters. And we need to step up, that’s what leadership is all about. But the way we are going to lead this country and beat Donald Trump is going to be with a candidate who has rock solid values and who actually gets something done. When Mayor Bloomberg was busy blaming African Americans and Latinos for the housing crash of 2008, I was right here in Las Vegas, literally just a few blocks down the street holding hearings on the banks that were taking away homes from millions of families. That’s when I met Mr. Estrada, one of your neighbors. He came in to testify and he said he thought he’d done everything right with Wells Fargo. But what had happened? They took away his house in a matter of weeks. This man stood there and cried while he talked about what it was like to tell his two little daughters that they might not be in their elementary schools, that they might be living out of their van. I spent the next years making sure that would never happen again. Wall Street fought us every inch of the way on a consumer agency. They lost and I won. We need a candidate with unshakeable values and a candidate who can actually get something done for working people. Senator, thank you. And that’s how I’ll beat Donald Trump. Senator Sanders. We have over 10.6 million people on Twitter and 99.9% of them are decent human beings, are working people, are people who believe in justice, compassion and love. And if there are a few people who make ugly remarks, who attack trade union leaders, I disowned those people, they are not part of our movement. But let me also say, what I hope my friends up here will agree with, is that if you look at the wild West of the internet, talk to some of the African American women on my campaign, talk to Senator Nina Turner, talk to others and find the vicious racist, sexist attacks that are coming their way as well. So I would hope that all of us understand that we should do everything we possibly can to end the viciousness and ugliness on the internet. Our campaign is about issues. It’s about fighting for the working families and the middle class. It is not about vicious attacks on other people. Senator, when you say that you disown these attacks and you didn’t personally direct them, I believe you. Well thank you. That’s just not true. Pete if you want to talk to some of the women on my campaign, what you will see is the most ugly, sexist, racist attacks that are… I won’t even describe them here, they’re so disgusting. And let me say something else about this, not being too paranoid. All of us remember 2016 and what we remember his efforts by Russians and others to try to interfere in our election and divide us up. I’m not saying that’s happening, but it would not shock me. I saw some of those tweets regarding the Culinary Workers Union. I have a 30 year, 100% pro-union voting record. Do you think I would support or anybody supports me, would be attacking union leaders? It’s not thinkable. But leadership is about what you draw out of people. It’s about how you inspire people to act. And right now we’re in this toxic political environment. Leadership isn’t just about policy. I think, at least in broad terms, we’re largely pulling in the same direction on policy. I have an idea. I have an idea of how we can stop sexism on the internet. We could nominate a woman for candidate for President of the United States. I think that might go a long way, if we showed our stuff as a party. And the other thing I’m going to talk about is really what is at the core of this issue between Senator Sanders and the Culinary Union. And that is this, these are hardworking people. Housekeepers, like Elizabeth and I met with last night, who have healthcare plans that have been negotiated over time, sweat and blood. Senator thank you. There are 149 million Americans that would lose their current health insurance under Senator Sanders’ bill. Senator thank you. That’s what it says on page eight and I don’t think we should forget that. On that note, I want to turn it over to my colleague Chuck Todd. Senator Sanders, I’m going to stay on this topic, on this issue with the Culinary Union. Obviously their leaders are warning their members about that your health care plan will take away their healthcare plan, take away private insurance completely. There are some Democrats who like you a lot, but worry that this plan, Medicare-for-all, is going to take away private insurance and that it goes too far. No. Let me be very clear, two points. For a hundred years, from Teddy Roosevelt to Barack Obama, this country has been talking about the need to guarantee health care for people. And yet today, despite spending twice as much per capita, Chuck, twice as much as any other major country on earth, we got 87 million who are uninsured or under insured. We got over 60,000 people who die every year because they don’t get to a doctor on time. We’re getting ripped off outrageously by the greed and corruption of the pharmaceutical industry, which in some cases charges us 10 times more for the same drugs because of their price fixing. 500,000 people go bankrupt every year because they can’t afford medical bills. So let me be very clear, to my good friends in the Culinary Workers Union, a great union, I will never sign a bill that will reduce the health care benefits they have. We will only expand it, for them, for every union in America and for the working class of this country. Senator Warren, you were all in on Medicare-for-all and then you have since came up with a transition plan. So I want to be clear. I’ve been to the Culinary Unions’ healthcare facilities, they’re terrific. You don’t want to shut them down, you want to expand them. You want to see them all across Nevada and all across this country. But we need to get everybody’s healthcare plan out here. Mayor Buttigieg really has a slogan that was thought up by his consultants, to paper over a thin version of a plan that would leave millions of people unable to afford their healthcare. It’s not a plan, it’s a PowerPoint. And Amy’s plan is even less, it’s like a Post-it Note, insert plan here. Bernie has started very much, has a good start. But instead of expanding and bringing in more people to help, instead his campaign relentlessly attacks everyone who asks a question or tries to fill in details about how to actually make this work. And then his own advisor’s say, “Eh, probably won’t happen anyway.” Look, healthcare is a crisis in this country. My approach to this is we need as much help for as many people as quickly as possible and bring in as many supporters as we can. And if we don’t get it all the first time, take the win and come back into the fight to ask for more. I promise guys, I’m going to get everybody in. People need our help on this. I got you. Mayor Buttigieg, I think she named checked you first. I’ll let you go first. She name checked me second. Yes. Well, okay. I think Amy’s second. I’m more of a Microsoft Word guy. And if you look at my plan, I don’t know if there are any PowerPoints on it, but you can definitely find the document on peteforamerica.com. And you’ll see that it is a plan that solves the problem, makes sure there is no such thing as an uninsured American and does it without kicking anybody off the plan that they have. This idea that the union members don’t know what’s good for them is the exact kind of condescension and arrogance that makes people skeptical of the policies we’ve been putting forward. Here we have a plan that the majority of Americans support. Do you realize how historic that is? That the American people are ready in a way, far beyond what was true even 10 years ago and what was available to President Obama at the time. There’s a powerful American majority ready to undertake the biggest, most progressive reform we’ve had in healthcare in 50 years, just so long as we don’t force it on anybody. Let me get Senator Klobuchar and then I’ll have you respond. All right, Senator Klobuchar. [inaudible 00:20:24]. I think the Post-it Note came first, Senator. I must say personal offense since post it notes were invented in my state. [crosstalk 00:00:20:38]. Okay. So my plan is a public option and according to all the studies out there, it would reduce premiums for 12 million people immediately. It would expand coverage for about that same number. It is a significant thing, it is what Barack Obama wanted to do from the very beginning. And the way I look at it since we’re in Vegas, when it comes to your plan, Elizabeth and Bernie’s on Medicare-for-all, you don’t put your money on a number that’s not even on the wheel. And why is Medicare-for-all not on the wheel? Why is it not on the wheel? Because two thirds of the democratic Senators are not even on that bill, because a bunch of the new House members that got elected see the problems with blowing up the Affordable Care Act. They see it right in front of them. And the truth is that when you see some troubled waters, you don’t blow up a bridge, you build one. And so we need to improve the Affordable Care Act, not blow it up. All right, Senator Sanders. I will. You name checked three of them. Let me get Senator Sanders in there. You were. Okay. Go ahead, Senator Sanders. We’ll get you in Liz. We got a lot of people in here that got hit. Yes sir. Okay. Somehow or another, Canada can provide universal health care to all their people at half the cost. UK can do it, France can do, Germany did. … half the cost. UK can do it. France can do it. Germany could. All of Europe can do it. Gee whiz. Somehow or another, we are the only major country on earth that can’t do it. Why is that? And I’ll tell you why. It’s because last year the healthcare industry made $100 billion in profits. Pharmaceutical industry, top six companies, $69 billion in profit. And those CEOs are contributing to Pete’s campaign and other campaigns. Let’s clear this up right now. Maybe it is finally time that we said as a nation, “Enough is enough. The function of a rational healthcare system is not to make the pharmaceutical industry and the drug companies rich. It is to provide healthcare to all people as a human right, not a privilege.” No premiums. Mr. Vice President, we get it. No copayments. No deductibles. Go ahead. [crosstalk 00:22:59] Mr. Vice President, center one. I’m the only one in this stage that actually got anything done on healthcare. I’m the guy the president turned to and said, “Go get the votes for Obamacare.” And I notice what everybody’s talking about is the plan that I first introduced. That is to go and add to Obamacare, provide a public option, a Medicare like option it cost and increase the subsidies. It costs a lot of money. It cost $750 billion over 10 years, but I pay for it by making sure that Mike and other people pay at the same tax rate their secretary pays at. That’s how we get it paid, number one. Number two, you know from the moment we passed that signature legislation, Mike called it a disgrace. Number one. Number two, Trump decided to get rid of it. And number three, my friends here came up with another plan. But they don’t tell you when you ask Bernie how much it costs, the last time he said that, if he goes on your show, he said, “We’ll find out. We’ll find out how,” or something to that effect. It cost over 35 trillion bucks. Let’s get real. Senator Warren, you get the final word on this. We’re going to move to another question. Go ahead, Senator Warren. And your plan costs $50 trillion. So I actually took a look at the plans that are posted. Mayor Buttigieg, there are four expenses that families pay, right? Premiums, deductibles, copays, and uncovered medical expenses. Mayor Buttigieg says he will put a cap only on the premiums. That’s not true. And that means families are going to pick up the rest of the costs. Amy, I looked online at your plan. It’s two paragraphs. Families are suffering and they need a plan. Okay, that’s it. You can’t simply stand here and trash an idea to give healthcare coverage to everyone without having a realistic plan of your own. And if you’re not going to own up to the fact either that you don’t have a plan or that your plan is going to leave people without healthcare coverage, full coverage, then you need to say so. I just want to stay on this [crosstalk 00:25:01] was in Reno when I met a man who said he had diabetes. He gets his insulin through the VA, but his sister and his daughter also have diabetes. No way to pay for their insulin. Three human beings right here in Nevada who are struggling. They share one insulin prescription. Okay. Very quickly. I am a fan of Obamacare. Since when Mr. Mr Vice President, I just checked the record because you’d said one time that I was not. In ’09 I testified and gave a speech before the mayor’s conference in Washington advocating it and trying to get all the mayors to sign on. And I think at that time I wrote an article praising Obamacare. Let me finish. Thank you. I was in favor of it. I thought it didn’t do … go as far as we should. What Trump has done to this is a disgrace. The first thing we’ve got to do is get the White House and bring back those things that will left and then find a ways to expand it. Another public option to having some rules about capping charges. All of those things. We shouldn’t just walk away and start something that is totally new, untried. Okay. Vice President Biden, go ahead. The mayor said when we passed it, the signature piece of this administration, it’s a disgrace. They’re the exact words. It was a disgrace. Look it up. Check it out. It was a disgrace. [crosstalk 00:26:42] covered by the way, that plan you do not have surprise billing. You bring down drug prices. People are not … Give people all the things we’re just talking about. Thank you, sir. Lester. We haven’t responded to [crosstalk 00:26:59] allegation. … at the beginning of this debate, you took some incoming fire on this next topic, so let’s get into it. In 2015 this is how you described your policing policy as mayor quote, “We put all the cops in the minority neighborhoods.” And you explain that is quote, “Because that’s where all the crime is. You went on to say, “And the way you should get the guns out of the kids’ hands is to throw them against the wall and frisk them. Well, if I go back and look at my time in office, the one thing that I’m really worried about, embarrassed about, was how it turned out with Stop and Frisk. When I got into office, there was 650 murders a year in New York City. I thought that my first responsibility was to give people the right to live. That’s the basic right of everything. And we started, we adopted a policy which had been in place. The policy that all big police departments use of stop and frisk. What happened, however was it got out of control. And when we discovered, I discovered, that we were doing many, many, too many stop and frisks, we cut 95% of it out. I’ve sat down with a bunch of African-American clergy and business people to talk about this, to try to learn. I’ve talked to a number of kids who’d been stopped. I was trying to understand how we change our policies so we can keep the city safe because the crime rate did go from 650, 50% down, to 300. And we have to keep lid on crime, but we cannot go out and stop people indiscriminately. That was what was happening. Mayor, thank you. Let me go to Vice President Biden with this. Yes. Let’s get something straight. The reason the stop and frisk change is because Barack Obama sent moderators to see what was going on. When we sent them there to say, “This practice has to stop,” the mayor thought it was a terrible idea. We send them there, a terrible idea. Let’s get the facts straight. Let’s get the order straight. And it’s not whether he apologize or not, it’s the policy. The policy was abhorrent and it was, in fact, of violation of every right people have. We are the one, our administration sent in people to monitor it. And the very time the mayor argued against that. This idea that he figured out it was a bad idea. He figured out it was a bad idea after we sent in monitors and said it must stop. Even then he continued the policy. All right. Yes, I would. I’ve sat. I’ve apologized. I’ve asked for forgiveness, but the bottom line is that we stopped too many people. We stopped too many people and we’ve got to make sure that we do something about criminal justice in this country. There is no great answer to a lot of these problems. If we took off everybody that was wrong off this panel, everybody that was wrong on criminal justice at some time in their careers, there’d be nobody else up here. Senator Warren. Let’s be clear. I’m sorry. Senator Warren. I do think that this really is about leadership and accountability. When the mayor says that he apologized, listen very closely to the apology. The language he used is about stop and frisk. It’s about how it turned out. Now this isn’t about how it turned out. This is about what it was designed to do to begin with. It targeted communities of color, it targeted black and brown men from the beginning. And if you want to issue a real apology, then the apology has to start with the intent of the plan as it was put together and the willful ignorance day by day by day of admitting what was happening. Even as people protested in your own street, shutting out the sounds of people telling you how your own policy was breaking their lives. You need a different apology. Senator, thank you. Senator Klobuchar, we’re going to stay on this topic, but I want to get something in here with Senator Klobuchar. When you were the top prosecutor in Minneapolis, Senator, there were at least two dozen instances where police were involved in the deaths of civilians. None of those officers were prosecuted. You did prosecute a black teenager who was sentenced to life in prison despite what are now serious doubts about the evidence. Now, the Minneapolis chapter of the NAACP has recently called for you to suspend your campaign over that case because some new evidence has come out since. Big picture. First, I’ll start with that case. It is very clear that any evidence, if there is new evidence, even old evidence, it should be reviewed by that office and by the County attorney. That must happen. I have called for that review. This was a case involving an 11-year-old African-American girl named Tyesha Edwards who was shot doing her homework at her kitchen table. Three people were convicted. One of the cases is the one that is being investigated … was investigated by a journalist. And I think it’s very important that that evidence come forward. In terms of the police shootings that you noted, those went to a grand jury, every single one of them. And I made very clear, for months now, that like so many prosecutors, I think those cases, in my time, they were all going to the grand jury. It was thought that was the best way to handle them in many, many jurisdictions. Do you think you should’ve spoke up? You didn’t speak up at the time. I actually did speak up on something very similar and that was when our police chief in Minneapolis tried to take the investigations of police shootings into his own hands. I strongly said I disagreed with that. Now I do believe also that a prosecutor should make those decisions herself. And the last thing I will say, because you asked the question about voting, I have the support of African-Americans in my community in every election. I had strong support and strong support of leadership. And that’s because I earned it. And this is going to be on me to earn it. You earn it with what you stand for when it comes to equal opportunity. You earn it with the work that I have done, the leadership I’ve shown on voting rights. And yes, you earn it with the work that must be done on criminal justice reform. Thank you, Senator. Hallie Jackson. I wan to talk about transparency here. [inaudible 00:33:45] many Democrats, including most of you on stage, have criticized president Trump for his lack of transparency. But Senator Sanders, when you are here in Las Vegas in October, you are hospitalized with a heart attack. Afterwards, you pledged to make a quote, “All your medical records public.” You’ve released three letters from your doctors, but you now say you won’t release anything more. I think we did. Let me tell you what happened. First of all, you’re right and thank you Las Vegas for the excellent medical care I got in the hospital two days. And I think the one area, maybe that Mayor Bloomberg and I share, you have stents as well. 25 years ago. Well, we both have two stents. It’s a procedure that is done about a million times a year. So we released the full report of that heart attack. Second of all, we released the full, my whole 29 years in the Capitol, the attending physician, all of my history, medical history. And furthermore, we released reports from two leading Vermont cardiologist who described my situation. And by the way, who said, “Bernie Sanders is more than able to deal with the stress and the vigor of being president of the United States.” Hey, follow me around the campaign trail. Three, four, five events a day. See how you’re doing compared to me. Mayor Buttigieg, you’ve been critical about transparency on this stage and people needing to do better. No, it’s not because, first of all, let me say we are all delighted that you are in fighting shape. Thank you. And at the same time, transparency matters, especially living through the Trump era. Now under president Obama, the standard was that the president would release full medical records. Do a physical and release the readout. I think that’s the standard that we should hold ourselves to as well. Now, President Trump lowered that standard. He said just a letter from a doctor is enough, and a lot of folks on this stage are now saying that’s enough. But I am certainly prepared to get a physical, put out the results. I think everybody here should be willing to do the same. But I’m actually less concerned about the lack of transparency on Sander’s personal health than I am about the lack of transparency on how to pay for his healthcare plan. Since he said that it’s impossible to even know how much it’s going to cost. And even after raising taxes on everybody making $29,000, there is still a multi-trillion dollar hole. Matter of fact, if you add up his policies altogether, they come to $50 trillion. He’s only explained $25 trillion worth of revenue, which means that the hole in there is bigger than the size of the entire economy of the United States. The time has come to level with the American people on matters personal and on matters of policy. Thank you. Senator Sanders, quickly. Let’s level. Let’s level, Pete. Can I finish? The average American today is paying $12,000 a year. That’s what that family is paying. 20% of a 60,000 income, $12,000 a year. Highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. Just the other day, a major study came out from Yale, epidemiologists in Lancet, one of the leading medical publications in the world. What they said, my friends, is Medicare for all will save $450 billion a year because we are eliminated the absurdity of thousands of separate plans that required hundreds of billions of dollars of administration. And by the way, ending the hundred billion a year in profiteering for the drug companies and the insurance companies. This is really important. Senator Sanders, thank you. Mayor Bloomberg, I want to go to you on this. Your plan, by the way [crosstalk 00:37:31] costs. That’s false. Look, if my plan is to status quo, why was it attacked by the insurance industry the moment it came out? And on issue after issue after issue, this is what Senator Sanders is saying. If you’re not with him, if you’re not all the way on his side, then you must be for the status quo. Well you know what? That is a picture that leaves most of the American people out. I want to go to Mayor Bloomberg on this, the transparency issue. Yes. … when it comes to transparency, but people are already voting now. It just takes us a long time. Fortunately, I make a lot of money and we do business all around the world and we are preparing it. The number of pages will probably be in the thousands of pages. I can’t go to Turbo Tax, but I put out my tax return every year for 12 years in city hall. We will put out this one. It says, tells everybody everything they need to know about every investments that I make and where the money goes. And the biggest item is all the money I give away, and we list that. Every single donation I make, and you can get that from our foundation anytime you want. I’m just looking at my husband in the front row that has to like do our taxes all the time. We probably could go to Turbo Tax. And the point of this is I believe in transparency. I had a physical, by the way. It came out well. We might all be surprised if my blood pressure is lower than Mayor Pete’s. That might really shock everyone out there. And I think you should release your records from your physical. Secondly, when it comes to tax returns, everyone up here has released their tax returns, Mayor. And it is a major issue because the president of the United States has been hiding behind his tax returns, even when courts order him to come forward with those tax returns. I don’t care how much money anyone has. I think it’s great you got a lot of money, but I think you’ve got to come forward with your tax returns. Senator Warren, I’m going to get to you in a second. Mayor Bloomberg, quick response to Senator Klobuchar. We’re releasing them. They’ll be out in a few weeks, and that’s just as fast as I can do it. Remember, I only entered into this race 10 weeks ago. All of my associates here have been at this for a couple of years. That’s right, we have. Let me ask you about something else, Mr. 10 weeks ago [crosstalk 00:39:53] over time and get it done. Mayor Bloomberg, let me ask you about something else. Senator Warren. Wish it were that simple. I’ll let you get in here. It would save me a lot of money. Let me ask you about something else. Several former employees have claimed that your company was a hostile workplace for women. When you were confronted about it, you admitted making sexually suggestive remarks saying quote, “That’s the way I grew up.” In a lawsuit in the 1990s, according to the Washington Post, one former female employee alleged that you said quote, “I would do you in a second. Let me say a couple things and if I can have my full minute and a quarter. Thank you. I have no tolerance for the kind of behavior that the Me Too Movement has exposed. And anybody that does anything wrong in our company, we investigate it. And if it’s appropriate, they’re gone that day. But let me tell you what I do in my company and my foundation and in city government when I was there. In my foundation, the person that runs, it’s a woman. 70% of the people there are women. In my company, lots and lots of women have big responsibilities. They get paid exactly the same as men. And in city hall, the person that’s the top person, my deputy mayor was a woman and 40% of our commissioners were women. I am very proud of the fact that about two weeks ago we were awarded, we were voted the most … the best place to work, second best place in America. If that doesn’t say something about our employees and how happy they are, I don’t know what does. Senator Warren, you’ve been critical of Mayor Bloomberg on this issue. Yes, I have. I hope you’ve heard what his defense was, “I’ve been nice to some women.” That just doesn’t cut it. The mayor has to stand on his record. And what we need to know is exactly what’s lurking out there. He has gotten some number of women … dozens? Who knows … to sign nondisclosure agreements both for sexual harassment and for gender discrimination in the workplace. So Mr. We have a very few nondisclosure agreements. Let me finish. None of them accused me of doing anything other than maybe they didn’t like a joke I told. These would be agreements between two parties that wanted to keep it quiet and that’s up to them. They signed those agreements and we’ll live with it. Come on. So wait. When you say a … I just want to be clear. Senator, no. Senator, the company and somebody else, in this … the man or a woman or could be more than that, they decided when they made an agreement that they wanted to keep it quiet for everybody’s interests. No. Come on. They sign the agreements and that’s what we’re going to live. They could release them now. I’m sorry. I heard your question. … bound by being muzzled by you? And you could release them from that immediately. Because understand, this is not just a question of the mayor’s character. This is also a question about electability. We are not going to be Donald Trump with a man who has who knows how many nondisclosure agreements and the drip, drip, drip of stories of women saying they have been harassed and discriminated against. That’s not what we do as Democrats. … and discriminated against. That’s not what we do as Democrats. Mr. Vice President. Look, let’s get something straight here. It’s easy, all the mayor has to do is say you are released from the non-disclosed agreement, period. We talk about transparency here. This guy got himself in trouble and he couldn’t disclose what he did, he went to his company. To be super clear that was about the list of clients, so nobody gets the wrong idea. No, no, I’m sorry. I know what you mean, no, you’re right. He went to the company and said, “I want to be released. I want to be able to do it.” Look, this is about transparency. From the very beginning, whether it’s your health record, whether it’s your taxes, whether you have cases against you, whether or not people have signed nondisclosure agreements. You think that women in fact were ready to say, “I don’t want anybody to know about what you did to me.” That’s not how it works. The way it works is they say, “Look, this is what you did to me.” And the mayor comes along and his attorney said, “I will give you this amount of money if you promise you’ll never say anything.” That’s how it works. Mayor Bloomberg, final word to you. I’ve said, we’re not going to end these agreements because they were made consensually and they have every right to expect that they will stay private. If they want to release it, they should be able to release themselves. Say yes. You know, we talk about electability and everybody up here wants to beat Trump. And we talked about stop and frisk and [inaudible 00:45:32] has established and the problems there, but maybe we should also ask how Mayor Bloomberg in 2004 supported George W. Bush for president. Put money into Republican candidates for the United States Senate, when some of us, Joe and I and others were fighting for Democrats to control the United States Senate. [inaudible 00:45:51]. Maybe we can talk about a billionaire saying that we should not raise the minimum wage or that we should cut social security, Medicare and Medicaid. If that’s a way to beat Donald Trump, wow, I would be very surprised. Thank you, Senator. Vanessa to you. Wait, wait. Senator Klobuchar, you’re running om your Washington experience. But last week in a Telemundo interview, you could not name the President of Mexico or discuss any of his policies. Last night you defended yourself saying, “This isn’t Jeopardy. Of course. Of course. And I don’t think that that momentary forgetfulness actually reflects what I know about Mexico and how much I care about it. And I first want to say greetings to President Lopez Obrador. Secondly, what I meant the game of Jeopardy is that I think we could all come up with things. You know how many members are there in the Israeli Knesset? 120. Senator Klobuchar. Hernandez. Senator Klobuchar. When it comes to Mexico, I am the one person on this stage that came out first to say I was for the U.S. Mexican Canadian trade agreement. That is going to be one of the number one duties of a president is to implement that. Senator Klobuchar, my colleague specifically asked you if you could name the President of Mexico and your response was no. Yes, that’s right. And I said that I made an error. I think having a president that maybe is humble and is able to admit that here and there, maybe wouldn’t be a bad thing. Mayor Buttigieg, your response [crosstalk 00:47:46]. Yeah, look, I wouldn’t liken this to trivia. I’m actually didn’t know how many members were in the Knesset. So you got me there. Well, there you go. But you’re staking your candidacy on your Washington experience. You’re on the committee that oversees border security. You’re on the committee that does trade. You’re literally part of the committee that’s overseeing these things and we’re not able to speak to literally the first thing about the politics of the country to our south. I’m saying you shouldn’t trivialize that knowledge. I said I made an error. People sometimes forget names. Thank you, Senator. If I could respond, this was a pretty big allegation. Quickly, please. He’s basically saying that I don’t have the experience to be President of the United States. I have passed over 100 bills as the lead Democrat since being in the U.S. Senate. I am the one, not you, that has won statewide in congressional district after congressional district. And I will say when you tried in Indiana, Pete, to run, what happened to you? You lost by over 20 points to someone who later lost to my friend Joe Donnelly. So don’t tell me about experience. What unites us here is we want to win and I think we should put a proven winner in charge of the ticket. Your response, Mayor Buttigieg. This is the race for president. If winning a race for Senate in Minnesota translated directly to becoming president, I would have grown up under the presidency of Walter Mondale. This is different. And the reason that I think we need to talk about Washington experience is that we should ask what that experience has led to. Experiences and certainly tenure is not always the same thing as judgment. If we’re going to talk about votes in the Senate in Washington, let’s talk [crosstalk 00:49:38]. Hello, hello, hello. Thank you. [crosstalk 00:49:46] Senator Warren and Mayor Bloomberg, this question is for you. I want to talk about and maybe this is appropriate here. Can I just defend Senator Klobuchar for a minute? This is not right. I understand that she forgot a name. It happens. It happens to everybody on this stage. Look, you want to ask about whether or not you understand trade policy with Mexico, have at it, and if you get it wrong, man, you ought to be held accountable for that. You want to ask about the economy and you get it wrong, you ought to be held accountable. You want to ask about a thousand different issues and you get it wrong, you ought to be held accountable. But let’s just be clear, missing a name all by itself does not indicate that you do not understand what’s going on. And I just think this is unfair. [crosstalk 00:06:42]. Senator Warren, you’re right but Senator Klobuchar could not discuss Mexican policy either. Fair enough. I’m the only one who knows this man and met with him. I do have to respond. Come on, man. [crosstalk 00:50:55] You have just invoked my name again and I ask you to look at the interview I did directly after the forum, which we went into great detail on Latin American policy. And I want to say one thing about Mayor Pete where we just disagree, he was asked on a debate stage about the Mexican cartels, which are bad, bad criminal organizations. He said that he would be open to classifying them as terrorist organizations. I actually don’t agree with that. That is a very valid debate to have. I don’t think that would be good for our security coordination with Mexico. And I think you got that wrong [crosstalk 00:51:35]. I’ve spent more time in Mexico than anybody. Hold on. Si. Si, thank you. Look, I’m the only who spent extensive, hundreds of hours in Latin America. So, you all ready to play some Nevada trivia now? I’m only half joking here. Let’s talk about this issue because it’s up there and polls, voters are really concerned about it as you all know. What you might not know is that Las Vegas and Reno are the vibrant economic engines for the state of Nevada and are also two of the fastest warming cities in the country. In certain months of the year, the heat is already an emergency situation for residents and for tourists walking up and down the strip. So I’m going to start with you, Mr. It is the existential threat that humanity faces, global warming. I went out to check and you have a facility where you have the one of the largest, largest solar panel arrays in the world. And when the fourth stage is completed, you’ll be able to take care of 60,000 homes for every single bit of their needs. And what I would do is number one, work on providing the $47 billion we have for tech and to making sure we find answers is to provide a way to transmit that wind and solar energy across the network of all the United States. Invest in battery technology. I would immediately restate all of the elimination of what Trump has eliminated in terms of EPA. I would secondly make sure that we had 500,000 new charging stations in every new highway we built in the United States of America or repaired. I would make sure that we, once again, made sure that we got the mileage standards back up, which would have saved over 12 billion barrels of oil had he not walked away from it. And I would invest in rail, in rail. Rail can take hundreds of thousands, millions of cars off the road if we have high speed rail. Thank you Mr. Vice President. I want to get some of the rest of you in on this because y’all have plans. Mayor Bloomberg, let me read what you said about this issue. You said you want to intensify U.S. and international actions to stop the expansion of coal. Well, already we’ve closed 304 out of the 530 coal-fired power plants in the United States. And we’ve closed 80 out of the 200 or 300 that are in Europe. Bloomberg Philanthropies working with the Sierra club. That’s one of the things you do. But just let’s start at the beginning. If you’re president, the first thing you do the first day is you rejoin the Paris Agreement. This is just ridiculous for us to drop out. Two, America’s responsibility is to be the leader in the world and if we don’t, we’re the ones that are going to get hurt just as much as anybody else. And that’s why I don’t want to have us cut off our relationships with China because you will never solve this problem without China and India, Western Europe and America. That’s for most of the [crosstalk 00:54:50]. Let me just finish one other thing. I believe, and you can tell me whether this is right, but the solar array that the vice president was talking about is being closed because it’s not economic. That you can put solar panels in and modern technology, even more modern than that. Mayor, I want to let Senator Warren jump in here. Just because you’ve said something that’s really specific to Nevada. The tension here in this state is between people want renewable energy and people want conservation on public lands. 85% of Nevada is managed by the federal government. You have said that you are going to have an executive order that would stop drilling on public lands, stop mining, which is a huge industry here. You got to have lithium, you got to have copper for renewable energy. So look, I think we should stop all new drilling and mining on public lands and all offshore drilling. If we need to make exceptions because there are specific minerals that we’ve got to have access to, then we locate those and we do it not in a way that just is about the profits of giant industries, but in a way that is sustainable for the environment. We cannot continue to let our public lands be used for profits by those who don’t care about our environment and are not making it better. Look, I’m going to say something that is really controversial in Washington, but I think I’m safe to say this here in Nevada. I believe in science and I believe that the way we’re going to deal with this problem, is that we are going to increase by 10 fold our investment in science. There’s an upcoming $27 trillion market worldwide for green and much of what is needed has not yet been invented. My proposal is let’s invent it here in the United States and then say we invent in the U.S., you’ve got to build it in the U.S. We’re going to stick to this topic but Senator Sanders, I’m going to move to fracking. You want a total ban on natural gas extraction, fracking in the next five years. The industry obviously supports a lot of jobs around the country, including thousands in the battleground state of Pennsylvania. One union official there told the New York Times, “If we end up with a Democratic candidate that supports a fracking ban, I’m going to tell my members that either you don’t vote or you vote for the other guy.” What do you tell these workers? It’s supporting a big industry right now, sir. What I tell these workers is that the scientists are telling us, that if we don’t act incredibly boldly within the next six, seven years, there will be irreparable damage done, not just in Nevada, not just to Vermont or Massachusetts, but to the entire world. Joe said it right, this is an existential threat. You know what that means, Chuck? That means we’re fighting for the future of this planet. And the Green New Deal that I support, by the way, will create up to 20 million good paying jobs as we move our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. This is a moral issue, my friends. We have to take the responsibility of making sure that the planet we leave our children and grandchildren is a planet that is healthy and habitable. That is more important than the profits of the fossil fuel industry. I want to keep this going. Senator Klobuchar, you’re not on the same page at a total ban of fracking. You call it a transitional fuel, but scientists are sounding this alarm now. Do you take these warnings that maybe fracking as a step backwards, not a step forward, not a transition. I made it very clear that we have to review all of the permits that are out there right now for natural gas and then make decisions on each one them and then not grant new ones until we make sure that it’s safe but it is a transitional fuel. And I want to add something that really hasn’t been brought up by my colleagues. This is a crisis and a lot of our plans are very similar to get to carbon neutral by 2045, 2050 something like that. But we’re not going to be able to pass this unless we bring people with us. I’m looking at these incredible senators from Nevada, Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen and I’m thinking that they know how important this is and you can do this in a smart way. One, get back into that international climate change agreement. Two, clean power rules, bring those back. A president can do this herself without Congress as well as the gas mileage standards. But when it comes to putting a sweep, a price on carbon … This is very important, Chuck. We have to make sure that that money goes back directly as dividends to the people that are going to need help for paying their bills. Otherwise, we’re not going to pass it. So there has to be a heart to the policy to get this done. Senator Warren, address the worker issue, if you don’t mind, as well. Yes, we can have a Green New Deal and create jobs. We need people in infrastructure who will help build. They could lose that job tomorrow though. That’s what they’re concerned about. Yes, those jobs are for tomorrow. Those are the ones we need to be working on to harden our infrastructure right now. But listen to Senator Klobuchar’s point. She says we have to think smaller in order to get it passed. I don’t think that’s the right approach here. Why can’t we get anything passed in Washington on climate? Everyone understands the urgency, but we’ve got two problems. The first is corruption, an industry that makes its money felt all through Washington. The first thing I want to do in Washington is pass my anti-corruption bill so that we can start making the changes we need to make on climate. And the second is the filibuster. If you’re not willing to roll back the filibuster, then you’re giving the fossil fuel industry a veto over all of the work that we need to do. Senator, thank you, Vanessa’s got the next question. Can I respond, she [crosstalk 01:00:57]. Vice President Biden, you have said that you want to hold the oil and gas executives accountable for their role in harming our planet. You have even suggested that you might put them in jail. I’m willing to go as far as we have to. First of all, I would eliminate all the subsidies we have for oil and gas, eliminate it, period. That would save millions and millions, billions of dollars. Number two, I think that any executive who was engaged in … and by the way, minority communities are the communities that would be most badly hurt by the way in which we deal with climate change. They are the ones that become the victims. That’s where the asthma is. That’s where the groundwater supply has been polluted. That’s where in fact, people in fact do not have the opportunity to be able to get away from, everything from, still asbestos in the walls of our schools. I have a trillion dollar program for infrastructure. That will provide for thousands and thousands of new jobs, not $15 an hour, but $50 an hour plus benefits. Unions, unions, being able to do that. And what it does is it will change the nature … Look, here’s the last point, my time’s going to run out. Here’s the last point I want to make to you. On day one when I’m elected president, I’m going to invite all of the members of the Paris Accord to Washington D.C. They make up 85% of the problem. They know me, I’m used to dealing with international relations. I will get them to up the ante in a big way. Vice President Biden, you didn’t answer to my questions. I thought I did. What would I do with them? I would make sure they, number one, stop. Number two, if you demonstrate that they in fact have done things already that are bad and they’ve been lying, they should be able to be sued. They should be able to be held personally accountable and they should … not only, not only the company, not the stock holders, but the CEOs of those companies. They should be engaged. And it’s a little bit like, look, this is the industry we should be able to sue. We should go after just like we did the drug companies, just like we did with the tobacco companies. Thank you, Vice President. We’re going to stay on the topic. My question is to Mayor Bloomberg, Mayor Bloomberg, your business is heavily invested in China. I think you mentioned that a few questions back, the number one producer in the world of carbon emissions. Well, you’re not going to go to war with them. You have to negotiate with them and try to … and we’ve seen how well that works with tariffs that are hurting us. What you have to do is convince the Chinese that is in their interest as well. Their people are going to die just as our people are going to die and we work together. In all fairness, the Chinese have slowed down. It’s India that is even bigger problem, but it is an enormous problem, nobody’s doing anything about it. We could right here in America make a big difference. We’re closing the coal-fired power plants. If we enforced some of the rules on fracking so that they don’t release methane into the air and into the water, you’ll make a big difference. But we’re not going to get rid of fracking for while and we frack incidentally not just natural gas, you frack oil as well. It is a technique and when it’s done poorly, like they’re doing it in too many places where the methane gets out into the air, it is very damaging. But it’s a transition fuel, I think the Senator said it right. We want to go to all renewables, but that’s still many years from now. And before, I think the Senator mentioned 2050 for some data. No scientist thinks the numbers for 2050 or 2050 anymore. They’re 2040, 2035. The world is coming apart faster than any scientific study had predicted. We just got to do something now [crosstalk 01:04:46]. Mayor Buttigieg, your thoughts. Let’s be real about the deadline. It’s not 2050. It’s not 2040. It’s not 2030. It’s 2020, because if we don’t elect a president who actually believes in climate science now, we will never meet any of the other scientific or policy deadlines that we need to. So first of all, let’s make sure we’re actually positioned to win. Which once again, if we put forward two of the most polarizing figures on this stage as the only option, it’s going to be a real struggle. Now I’ve got a plan to get us carbon neutral by 2050. And I think everybody up here has a plan that more or less does the same. So the real question is how are we going to actually get it done? We need leadership to make this a national project that breaks down the partisan and political tug of war that prevents anything from getting done. How do you do it? Well, first of all, making sure that those jobs are available quickly. Secondly, ensuring that we are pulling in those very sectors who have been made to feel like they’re part of the problem, from farming to industry, and fund as well as urge them to do the right thing. And then global climate diplomacy, I’m a little skeptical of the idea that convincing is going to do the trick when it comes to working with China. America has repeatedly overestimated our ability to shape Chinese ambitions, but what we can do is ensure that we use the hard tools [crosstalk 00:01:46]. Hold here for a second. -policy, to enforce what has to happen. Yes. I want to make sure that the question of environmental justice gets more than a glancing blow in this debate, because for generations now in this country, toxic waste dumps, polluting factories have been located in or near communities of color over and over and over. And the consequences are felt in the health of young African American babies. It’s felt in the health of seniors, people with compromised immune systems. It’s also felt economically. Who wants to move into an area where the air smells bad or you can’t drink the water. I have a commitment of $1 trillion to repair the damage that this nation has permitted to inflict on communities of color for generations now. We have to own up to our responsibility. We cannot simply talk about climate change in big global terms. We need to talk about it in terms of rescuing the communities that have been damaged. Senator Warren, thank you. [crosstalk 00:02:53]. I want to ask you about something else that is important to people here. I want to ask you about Latinos owning one out of every four new businesses in the, United States, many of them have benefited from president Trump’s tax cuts, and they may be hesitant about new taxes or regulations. No. Taxes and small [inaudible 00:03:15], matter of fact, we’re going to make sure there’s more money available for small businesses in the Latino community, in the black community, to be able to get the capital to start businesses. At the Treasury Department, there’s going to be a window available where we significantly increase the amount of money available so people can borrow the money to get started. They have demonstrated they’re incredibly successful. We should not be raising taxes on them. We should start rewarding work, not just wealth. That’s why we have to change the tax code the way it is. That’s why the wealthy have to start to pay their fair share. And that’s why we have to focus on giving people the ability to garner wealth, generate wealth. And that’s why this whole idea of red lining, lending to people in areas, wasn’t the cause of Wall Street failing. The greed of Wall Street was the reason why it occurred, not the red lining. And lastly, I want to say, look, the idea of China, China is and their Belt and Road proposal, they’re taking the dirtiest coal in the world, mostly out of Mongolia, and spreading it around the world. It’s clear. Make it clear when you call them to Washington in the first 100 days, “If you continue, you will suffer severe consequences because the rest of the world will impose tariffs on everything you’re selling because you are undercutting the entire economy. Thank you Mr. Vice President. Not if they are small businesses. I mean what we’ve got to do is level the playing field, where a company like Amazon or Chevron is paying literally zero on billions of dollars in profits. And it puts small businesses like the ones that are revitalizing my own city, often Latino owned on our West side, at a disadvantage. We need to recognize that investing in Latino entrepreneurship is not just an investment in the Latino community. It is an investment in the future of America. And it is time for a President who understands the value of immigration in lifting up all of our communities and our country. We are getting the exact opposite message from the current president. And it is time to recognize not just the diversity of the Latino community but the importance of issues like economic empowerment, healthcare, as well as [crosstalk 00:05:23]. We have an entrepreneurship gap in America. And that is a gap between white entrepreneurs and black and Latino entrepreneurs. And the principle reason for this is they don’t have the money for equity to get the businesses started. It’s about a $7 billion gap. We want to have real entrepreneurship and a level playing field. I have a plan to put the $7 billion in to have the fund managed by the people who are routinely cut out. It can’t just be about taxes. Thank you Senator. We need to make an investment to level the playing field. And in the black [crosstalk 00:06:06]. Excuse me. I want to get at something. I’m the only one here that’s started a business. Mayor Bloomberg, you seem to imply that red lining and stopping red lining has somehow contributed to the financial crisis. No. That’s exactly wrong. And that was the implication that came out in the quote. So I want to give you a chance to clarify this. Well on the record against red lining, since I worked on Wall Street. I was against it during the financial crisis. I’ve been against it since the financial crisis came about because the people that took the mortgages packaged them and other people bought them. That was where all the disaster was. Red lining is still a practice some places and we’ve got to cut it out, but it’s just not true. What I was going to say, maybe you want to talk about businesses. I’m the only one here I think that’s ever started a business. Is that fair? Okay. What do we need is, I can tell you in New York City we had programs. There are mentoring programs for the young business people so they can learn how to start a business. We had programs that could get them seed capital. We have programs to get branch banking in their neighborhoods, because if you don’t have a branch bank there, you can’t get a checking account, can’t get a checking account, you can’t get a loan. You can’t get a loan, you can’t get a mortgage. Then you don’t have any wealth. There’s ways to fix this and it doesn’t take trillions of dollars. It takes us to focus on the problems of small business. Senator Sanders, 45 seconds, then we’re going to move on. Senator Sanders, 45 seconds. All right. When we talk about a corrupt political system bought by billionaires like Mr. Bloomberg, it manifests itself in a tax code in which not only is Amazon and many other major corporations, some owned by the wealthiest people in this country, not paying a nickel in taxes, we have the insane situation that billionaires today, if you can believe it, have an effective tax rate lower than the middle-class. Senator, you’re writing the tax code. You did, you and your campaign contributions. You and the other 99 Senators. Not me. You and your campaign contributions are electing people to represent the wealthy and the powerful. Yes, those are the Democrats, thank you. Well, and Republicans too, and George W. Bush as well. I was just, I was thinking there was going to be a rematch on Saturday in Vegas and those guys should go down there. Senator Klobuchar, I actually want to get you to something about Senator Sanders tweeted last year, “Billionaires should not exist. Okay. I believe in capitalism. But I think the goal of someone in government and a President of the United States should be a check on that. I’m not going to limit what people make, but I think right now our tax code is so tilted against regular people and that is what’s wrong. I was thinking of your question about small businesses. The small businesses I talked to, they have trouble getting employees because their employees don’t have childcare. We should have universal childcare. And we have not been talking enough about Donald Trump and let’s just talk about Donald Trump because he signed that tax bill that helped the wealthy. And he went down Mar-a-Lago and he said to all his friends, “You just got a lot richer.” That is Exhibit A. And I can tell you the hardworking people in Nevada, were not in that room. So the key to me is to not limit what people can make, but make sure that we have a government that is fair for everyone. So Senator Sanders, what did you mean that you don’t think they should exist. I’ll tell you what I mean. We have a grotesque and immoral distribution of wealth income. Mike Bloomberg owns more wealth than the bottom 125 million Americans. That’s wrong. That’s immoral. That should not be the case when we got a half a million people sleeping out on the streets, where we have kids who cannot afford to go to college, when we have 45 million people dealing with student debt. We have enormous problems facing this country and we cannot continue seeing a situation where in the last three years, billionaires in this country saw an $850 billion increase in their wealth. Congratulations, Mr. Bloomberg. But the average American last year saw less than a 1% increase in his or her income. That’s wrong. I can’t speak for all billionaires. All I know is I’ve been very lucky, made a lot of money and I’m giving it all away to make this country better. And a good chunk of it goes to the Democratic Party as well. Yes. I worked very hard for it. And I’m giving it away. Thank you. Helen. Mayor, Senator Sanders has a proposal that will require all large companies to turn over up to 20% of their ownership to employees over time. I think that employee ownership of companies is a great idea. I’m not sure it makes sense to command those companies to do it. If we really want to deliver less inequality in this country, then we’ve got to start with the tax code. And we’ve got to start with investments in how people are able to live the American dream, which is in serious, serious decline. Matter of fact, last time I checked the list of countries to live out the American dream, in other words, to be born at the bottom and come out at the top, we’re not even in the top 10 number. Number one place to live out the American dream right now is Denmark. And as the, I think, the lone person on this stage who’s not a millionaire, let alone a billionaire, I believe that part of what needs to change is for the voices of the communities that haven’t felt heard on Wall Street or in Washington to actually be brought to Capitol Hill. It’s why I am building a politics designed around inclusion, designed around belonging, because the one thing that will definitely perpetuate the income inequality we’re living with right now is for Donald Trump to be reelected because we polarize this country with the wrong nominees. Senator Sanders, it’s your policy. It is your policy. Thank you. It is my policy and I’m very proud of that policy. What we need to do to deal with this grotesque level of income and wealth inequality is make sure that those people who are working, you know what Mr. Bloomberg? It wasn’t you who made all that money. Maybe your workers played some role in that as well. And it is important that those workers are able to share the benefits also. When we have so many people go to work every day and they feel not good about their jobs, they feel like cogs in a machine. I want workers to be able to sit on corporate boards as well, so they can have some say of what happens to their lives. Mayor Bloomberg, you own a large company. Absolutely not. I can’t think of a way that would make it easier for Donald Trump to get reelected than listening to this conversation. This is ridiculous. We’re not going to throw out capitalism. We tried that. Other countries tried that. It was called communism and it just didn’t work. So let me make a proposal that will work, that has not only support from a majority of Democrats, but also from a majority of the independents and a majority of Republicans. And that is a two cent wealth tax on all fortunes above $50 million. You hit a billion, you’ve got to pay a few pennies more. This is a tax on the top 1/10th of 1% in America. And it permits us to start to restructure our economy. It means we can afford universal childcare for every baby in this country, age zero to five. It means we can have universal pre-K for every child in America. It means we can raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher and stop exploiting the black and brown women who do this work. It means we can put $800 billion into our public schools, quadruple funding for Title One schools. And as a former special education teacher, we could fully fund IDEA so children with disabilities would get the full education they need. We can do college. We can put $50 billion dollars into our historically black colleges and universities. And we could cancel student loan debt for 43 million Americans. That’s something a majority of Americans support, a two cent wealth tax. It is a question of values. Do we want to invest in Mr. Senator Sanders, my next question is for you. Senator Sanders, our latest NBC News, Wall Street Journal poll released yesterday. Two thirds of all voters said they were uncomfortable with a socialist candidate for President. The questions to you. Well, the question was that I was winning and I think by a fairly comfortable margin. You might mention that. But here is the point. Let’s talk about democratic socialism, not communism Mr. Bloomberg, that’s a cheap shot. Let’s talk about democratic. Let’s talk about what goes on in countries like Denmark, where Pete correctly pointed out, they have a much higher quality of life in many respects than we do. We are living in many ways in a socialist society right now. Problem is, as Dr. Martin Luther King reminded us, we have socialism for the very rich, rugged individualism for the poor. Wait a second. Let me finish. When Donald Trump gets $800 million in tax breaks and subsidies to build luxury condominiums, that’s socialism for the rich. Walmart, we have to subsidize Walmart’s workers who are on Medicaid and food stamps because the wealthiest family in America pays starvation wages, that’s socialism for the rich. I believe in democratic socialism for working people, not billionaires, health care for all, and educational opportunities for all. Senator, thank you. Mayor Bloomberg, would you like to- [crosstalk 00:16:41]. Creating a government to works [crosstalk 00:16:44] for all, not just Mr. Bloomberg. The question was about socialism. What a wonderful country we have, the best known socialist in the country happens to be a millionaire with three houses. Well, you missed that I work in Washington, house one. That’s the first problem. Live in Burlington, house two. That’s good. And like thousands of other Vermonters, I do have a summer camp. Forgive me for that. [inaudible 00:17:00] cap, forgive me for that. New York, New York city. Thank you very much. And I pay all my taxes and I’m happy to do it because I get something for it. And let me say, I thought that the senator next to me was half-right. [inaudible 00:17:17]. I agree. We should raise taxes on the … I disagree with the senator on the wealth tax, but I do agree with her that the rich aren’t paying their fair share. We should raise taxes on the rich. I did that as mayor in New York City. I raised taxes and if you take a look at my plans, the first thing I would do is try to convince Congress, because they’ve got to do it, we can’t just order it, to roll back the tax cuts that the Trump administration put in through Congress. Vice President Biden, weigh in on this question of Americans’ feeling about socialist candidates. Well look, let me weigh in on, you know, for 36 years and as Vice President, I was listed as the poorest man in Congress. I made money when I wrote a book about my son and it surprised me how much it sold. First time I ever made any money, and here’s the deal. The fact is that we ought to start rewarding work, not just wealth. The idea that we have a tax rate for corporate America at 21% is ridiculous. It should be at 28%. that would raise almost $800 billion a year. The idea that we have companies not paying anything at all, they should have a minimum tax of 15%, that would raise another 740 billion a year. The idea that you’re able to have a capital gains tax that you pay at the rate of 20% if you are Mike Bloomberg or whomever, and has a whole lot of money and someone else is paying, your staffer is paying at 25%, is wrong. That would raise another $800 billion. We should be rewarding work, not just wealth. And the American people and the middle class is getting killed and the poor have no way up. All right, all right. Vice President Biden, thank you. Mayor Buttigieg, I want to get you in on this because in 2000, you wrote an award-winning essay. You praised Senator Sanders. You specifically praised him for embracing socialism. You have now since said that you are concerned about his policies, but I am curious about this. Are you out of touch with your own generation? Millennials, by a big chunk, embrace his version of democratic socialism. You do not. No. Look, it’s true that I was into Bernie before it was cool. Thank you. He was a congressman at the time, and the qualities I admired then are qualities I still respect a great deal. I never said that I agree with every part of his policy views then or now, but I appreciate that at least he’s straightforward and honest about it, and he’s honest about the fact that taxes will go up on anybody making more than $29,000.00 to fund his health care plan. But you’re not being honest, the premiums would be eliminated. I’m saving people money because they don’t pay any premiums, out-of-pocket expenses, co-payments or deductibles. They’re going to be much better off. But where’s the other $25 trillion supposed to come from? At a certain point, you got to do the math. Well, we’ve got it all up there on the internet. It’s a payroll tax. No, but even after the payroll tax because you still have a hole. Because we have a wealth tax. Elizabeth has a good one. Our is a little bit tougher on Mr. Bloomberg than hurts. We’re going to raise it in a progressive way, which deals with income and wealth inequality and make certain finally that healthcare in this country is a human right, not a privilege. Could I [crosstalk 00:20:49]. 45 seconds, Senator Warren, I’m just going to close it out here. You went out of your way to call yourself a capitalist. Yes, because I am. To separate yourself from him. Yes, because I am. Look, Democrats want to beat Donald Trump, but they are worried. They are worried about gambling on a narrow vision that doesn’t address the fears of millions of Americans across this country who see real problems and want real change. They are worried about gambling on a revolution that won’t bring along a majority of this country. Amy and Joe’s hearts are in the right place, but we can’t be so eager to be liked by Mitch McConnell that we forget how to fight the Republicans. Mayor Buttigieg has been taking money from big donors and changing his positions. That’s just not true. So it makes it unclear what it is he stands for other than his own advancement. Okay, Senator, thank you. Senator Klobuchar, go ahead you’ve got this. Senator Klobuchar, go ahead. You’ve got the floor for 45, go. Thank you. Number one. I have repeatedly said that we have to win big and the way we win big is winning states like Nevada, but also winning the Senate races in Arizona and in Colorado and beyond. And the reason we want to do that is to send Mitch McConnell packing. And I think when you look at my history, I am the one that has done that. I am the one that can lead this ticket and just because I am willing to talk about common ground, that’s where America is. It is not with Mitch McConnell who has 400 bills on his desk that should pass if we get rid of him. It is because I am willing to work with people and find common ground. Thank you Senator. That’s what we want in a president, Elisabeth. Let’s catch our breath here. Senator, thank you. We need to take another break here. We’ll return to The Paris Las Vegas in just a moment (silence). Welcome back to Las Vegas and the Democratic Presidential Debate. To kick off our next round of questioning, here’s Hallie. Mayor Buttigieg, to you. In 2018, Mayor Bloomberg was the biggest outside spender helping Democrats running for Congress. He’s also donated billions towards causes like climate change, gun safety, education. Oh, I think he should absolutely be doing everything in his power to defeat Donald Trump. I just don’t think that has to result in him becoming the President of the United States. Look, our party has values. We were built around values like making sure we protect working people, but Mayor Bloomberg opposed raising the minimum wage. Our party has a tradition that includes excellent presidents like Barack Obama, who Mayor Bloomberg opposed. At the end of the day, it’s not just about how much money you’ve got, it’s what you stand for. And we are living at a moment when Americans are so deeply frustrated with the way that both Wall Street and Washington seem to have overlooked our lives. The view from the porch of my one house in Indiana is that they can’t even see us sometimes. And if we’re going into the election of our lives against a president who rose to power by cynically exploited the frustration of ordinary Americans feeling like leaders weren’t speaking to them; then I think that turning to someone like Mayor Bloomberg who thinks he can buy this election is no better a way to succeed than turning to somebody like Senator Sanders who wants to burn the house down. Mr. Vice President. You know, if you [inaudible 00:28:47] the point of personal privilege used to say. It was said that I was in the pocket of Mitch McConnell. I’m the only person on this stage that’s beaten Mitch McConnell on four major, major cases. Let me finish. Let me finish. And Mitch McConnell. I’ve been the object of his affection and the President’s affection. The way he’s gone after me, this new Republican party, after me, after my son, after my family. I don’t need to be told I’m a friend of Mitch McConnell’s. Mitch McConnell has been the biggest pain in my neck in a long, long time and so that’s number one. Number two, we have to have somebody who understands what it’s like for ordinary people. Ordinary people come up. They have to understand, like my dad made that longest walk up a short flight of stairs, saying, “I don’t have a job honey. We have to move. You got to move in with grandpa.” How long it took to buy a house, how long it took to get back in the game again. They have to understand the needs of ordinary people and they are getting killed. No matter what people say about this economy, how good it is and the good part of the economy … It’s only 60 seconds, it’s not up yet, and the fact is that we’re in a situation where you have Mayor, excuse me, the President making clear that he doesn’t want any part of me being his opponent. He’s spending $125,000.00 this week to keep me from being an opponent. Thank you Mr. Vice President. Vanessa, to you. Thank you Hallie. He was identifying me specifically in that. 45 seconds to you Senator Warren. I was responding to an accusation. And so no, the point is different. Here’s what happened. According to the New York Times, the last time that Mitch McConnell was on the ballot, the Vice President stood in the Oval Office and said, “I hope that Mitch gets re-elected so I can keep working with him. That’s taken totally out of context. Well, Mitch did get did cap re-elected. He did not have an epiphany. Instead, he blocked really everything that Barack Obama tried to pass. Come on. Thank you Senator. Yeah [inaudible 00:00:30:55]. Thank you Senator. Our next question goes to Senator Klobuchar. About 700,000 young people known as Dreamers or Soñadores, who were brought to this country as children, are currently protected from deportation because of a program that is now under the review by the Supreme Court. To win. To beat Donald Trump. The best way to protect the Dreamers is to have a new President. There are the votes there to protect the Dreamers, and I have been working on this since I got to the United States Senate. In my first campaign, I actually had a bunch of ads run against me because I was standing up for immigrants. And when I think of Dreamers and I tried to explain it to my state, I found a 99-year-old Hispanic war veteran who was a Dreamer when he was brought over to this country. And back then, he just went to Canada for a night and came back and he was a permanent citizen because they needed him to serve in World War II. Now, not so easy. The Dreamers are our future. The Dreamers are so important in Nevada and the best way we can get this done is to beat Donald Trump, but it is to pass comprehensive immigration reform. Thank you. Which creates a path to citizenship to so many hardworking people, who will bring down the deficit by $158 billion and will bring peace for these Dreamers. Thank you so much Senator Klobuchar. They know no other country but our own. If you’re going to run based on your record of voting in Washington, then you have to own those votes, especially when it comes to immigration. You voted to confirm the Head of Customs and Border Protection under Trump, who was one of the architects of the family separation policy. You voted to make English the national language. You have been unusual among Democrats, I think the Democrat among all of the senators running for President, most likely to vote for Donald Trump’s judges who we know are especially hostile to Dreamers and to the rights of immigrants. Now in South Bend, it was not always easy to stand up in a conservative place like Indiana on immigration, but we delivered. We created a municipal ID program so that Dreamers and others who were undocumented were able to navigate everyday life. We stood up for those rights and stood with members of our community with the message that they were as American as we are [Spanish 00:33:31]. Thank you. [crosstalk 00:33:36] Senator Klobuchar. I wish everyone was as perfect as you, Pete, but let me tell you what it’s like to be in the arena. Number one, do the math. If my friend Andrew Yang was up here, that’s what he’d say. In fact, I have opposed, not supported two-thirds of the Trump judges, so get your numbers right. And I am in the top 10 to 15 of opposing them. Number two, when it comes to immigration reform. … number two, when it comes to immigration reform the things that you are referring to, that official that you are referring to, was supported by about half the Democrats. Including someone in this room. I will say this, he was highly recommended by the Obama officials. You know why? Because Trump had so few career people. I did not one bit agree with these draconian policies to separate kids from their parents. In my first 100 days I would immediately change that. Thank you Senator. … Ted Kennedy … He had made a pretty big allegation against me again. I think I should have a right to respond. I’m stating the facts because these are votes that you took. And those votes set you alone among the Democrats running for president. … the judges are false. Well I would say for anybody who ran for president this cycle. If you could let me finish. Since I’ve been in the arena Ted Kennedy asked me to work on the first immigration bill. We were able, with President Bush, to at least get that bill to a vote. I’m sorry, but Senator Sanders actually opposed that bill. I worked on it. If we had gotten that bill done there would have been a path to citizenship for so many people. Then I worked on the 2013 bill. I’m actually so proud of [crosstalk 00:35:25] the work I’ve done on immigration reform. You know what? You have not been in the arena doing that work. You’ve memorized a bunch of talking points and a bunch of things, but I can tell you one thing, what the people of this country want. They want a leader that has the heart for the immigrants of this country. That is me. Maybe leading a diverse city that was facing ruin doesn’t sound like the arena to you. I’m used to senators telling mayors that senators are more important than mayors, but this is the arena too. You don’t have to be in Washington to matter. Okay. … for [crosstalk 00:36:02] your work to be significant. Guys, guys. We are at the end here. We are at the end here. I got to let that one go. We are less than two weeks away from a national primary. I want to ask all of you this simple question. There’s a very good chance none of you are going to have enough delegates to the Democratic National Convention to clinch this nomination. Okay? If that happens, I want all of your opinions on this, should the person with the most delegates at the end of this primary season be the nominee? Even if they are short of a majority? Senator Sanders I’m going to let you go last here, because I know your view on this. Instead I will start with you Mayor Bloomberg. Whatever the rules of the for the Democratic Party are they should be followed. Yes or no, you got to make it fast. Yes. … you come to the convention. Okay. All of the people. All righty. Play by the rules. No, let the process work its way out. Not necessarily. Let the process work. All right. … that the will of the people should prevail. Okay. Yes. [crosstalk 00:37:24] Thank you guys. … who has the most votes should become the nominee. Five nos and a yes. We are not done yet. We’re back with more from Las Vegas after a short break. Welcome back everyone. It is time for closing statements. Each candidate will have one minute and we begin with Senator Klobuchar. This has been quite a debate. What I want everyone out there watching to remember is that what unites us is so much bigger than what divides us. That we need a candidate that can bring people with her. Yes a fired up Democratic base but also Independents and moderate Republicans. I’ve done that every single time. I have won every race down to fourth grade. A lot of boasting up here, so I thought I’d add that. Secondly, you need someone who can govern. I have passed over 100 bills as the lead Democrat. Third, you need someone that has the heart to be the president. They were talking a lot about heart conditions up here. We have a president right now that doesn’t have a heart. I love the people of this country. I ask for the vote of the people of Nevada because this state gets it. … that guy has in The White House. I ask you to join me at amyklobuchar.com. Senator, thank you. Thank you. Mayor Bloomberg, to you. Well you can join me at mikebloomberg.com too if you want but I’m not asking for any money. Look, this is a management job and Donald Trump’s not a manager. This is a job where you have to build teams, he doesn’t have a team so he goes and makes decisions without knowing what’s going on or the implications of what he does. We can not run the railroad this way. This country has to pull together and understand that the people that we elect, and it’s not just the president of the United States, they should have experience, they should have credentials, they should understand what they’re doing and the implications thereof. Then we should, as a society, try to hold them accountable so the next time they go before the voters, if they haven’t done the job we shouldn’t just say, “Oh nice person, gives a good speech.” We should say, “Didn’t do the job and you’re out of here. Mr. Mayor, thank you. Mayor Buttigieg, one minute. Well Nevada I’m asking for your vote because America is running out of time. This is our only chance to defeat Donald Trump. If you look at the choice between a revolution or the status quo and you don’t see where you fit in that picture then join us. Yes, go for peteforamerica.com and help out, because we need to draw everybody that we can who believes that we need to empower workers, who believes in climate science, who believes in doing something about gun violence and recognizes that the only way we can do this is to create a sense of belonging in this country that moves us out of the toxic and polarized moment that we are living in today. I already see an American majority ready to do these things. Now we have a responsibility to galvanize, not polarize, that majority. We can not afford to lean on the same Washington playbook. We can not afford to alienate half the country. We must step forward into the future in order to win and in order to govern a country that will be facing issues the likes of which we barely thought of just a few years ago. Mr. … thank you. … so that we can deliver that future together. Senator Warren, your turn. I grew up fighting. I grew up out in Oklahoma and I learned it probably from my mother. I watched when my daddy had a heart attack and didn’t have any money coming in. When our car was lost and when we were on the edge of losing our home. I watched my mother fight to save our family. I grew up fighting to save our family, my family. I eventually made it through school and spent my life as a teacher. Looking into why it is that so many families across this country are struggling and why it gets worse year, after year, after year. I, for years, have fought for unions. To say the way we’re going to restructure this economy is we’re going to make it easier to join a union and get more power into unions. To fight for students who have been cut out of opportunity over and over because of the rising cost of an education. Look, for me, I am … Of all the people on this stage I’ve been a politician the shortest time but I’ve been the one out fighting for families the longest time. I promise you this, give me a chance, I’ll go to The White House and I’ll fight for your family. Thank you Senator. [crosstalk 00:46:34] people. There’s not [crosstalk 00:46:37]. Just continue [inaudible 00:46:39]. [crosstalk 00:46:41]. [crosstalk 00:46:47] Please give us a moment. [crosstalk 00:46:58]. [crosstalk 00:46:58]. Senator Biden you have one minute. Look, I’m running because so many people are being left behind. People I grew up with in Scranton when my job lost his job, lost his house, had to move. We moved to Claymont and we found ourselves in a position where we had little ability to get anything done. My dad worked like hell. I learned a lot. I’ve been knocked down a whole hell of a lot. I know what it’s like to be knocked down, but I know we have to get back up. We have to provide some safety and security for the American people. Right here in Nevada the site of the most significant mass murder in American history. Guns. Our kids are getting sent to school having to hide under desks, learn how to run down corridors to avoid being shot. It’s immoral. I’m the only one that’s beating the NRA nationally and I’ve beat them twice. With regard to healthcare, it also is something that isn’t right. Obamacare has to be expanded. It can be, in fact, cover everybody. Lastly, I think it’s important that on day one we deal with sending an immigration bill to the desk. The only person in here has the worst record on immigration is Bernie because Bernie voted against the 2007 bill. … thank you. Thank you. Thank you Mr. Okay. … now American citizens. All right. Senator Sanders you have one minute for your closing argument. Unfortunately Rulac, among other groups, Latino groups, saw that bill having provisions akin to slavery Joe. But the bottom line is all of us are united in defeating the most dangerous president in the modern history of this country. That we agree on. But where we don’t agree, I think, is why we are today the only major country on Earth not to guarantee healthcare to all people. Why three people own more wealth than the bottom half of America, when 500,000 people sleep out on the street. Why hundreds of thousands of bright young kids can’t afford to go to college and 45 million remain in student debt. Bottom line here, real change never takes place from the top on down, never takes place from an oligarchy controlled by billionaires. We need to mobilize millions of people to stand up for justice. That’s our campaign. Join us at berniesanders.com. Thank you. Senator thank you. Folks, thank you. That concludes tonight’s debate. Our thanks to my fellow moderators, to the candidates, and of course to all of you, the audience, here and at home. The Nevada Caucuses are this Saturday. With the South Carolina primary just one week later. Then the big prize, Super Tuesday on March 3rd. We’ll be following it all for you. For now, for all of us at NBC News, I’m Lester Holt. Good day."
"27","02-22-20"," Thank you. Thank you, San Antonio. And let me introduce to you the next First Lady of the United States, Jane Sanders. You’ll be very proud of her as First Lady. Based on what I have seen today in Texas, we were in El Paso, we’re here now, don’t tell, don’t tell anybody, I don’t want to get them nervous. We are going to win the Democratic primary in Texas. And this is also important, the President gets very, very upset easily. So don’t tell him that we’re going to beat him here in Texas. And now I’m delighted to bring you a some pretty good news. I think all of you know we won the popular vote in Iowa. We won the New Hampshire primary. And according to those three networks and the A.P., we have now won the Nevada caucus. So let me thank the people of Nevada for their support. In Nevada, we have just put together a multi-generational multiracial coalition, which is going to not only win in Nevada, it’s going to sweep this country. And in Nevada and in New Hampshire and in Iowa what we showed is that our volunteers are prepared to knock on hundreds and hundreds of thousands of doors. That no campaign has a grassroots movement like we do, which is another reason why we’re going to win this election. In Nevada. I want to thank our rank and file union members. I want to thank Make The Road and all of the grassroots organizations that helped us win there. We are going to win here in Texas. We are going to win across the country because the American people are sick and tired of a president who lies all of the time. They are sick and tired of a corrupt administration. They are sick and tired of a president who is undermining American democracy, who thinks he is above the law and who apparently has never read the Constitution in this country. The American people are sick and tired of a government, which is based on greed, corruption, and lies. They want an administration which is based on the principles of justice. Economic justice, social justice, racial justice, and environmental justice. Now Trump and his friends think they are going to win this election. They think they’re going to win this election by dividing our people up based on the color of their skin or where they were born or their religion or their sexual orientation. We are going to win because we are doing exactly the opposite. We’re bringing our people together. We are bringing our people together, black and white and Latino, Native American, Asian, gay and straight. We are bringing our people together around an agenda that works for the working people of this country, not the one percent. All over this country, workers are sick and tired of earning starvation wages. You can’t make it on nine bucks an hour or 11 bucks an hour or 12 bucks an hour. We are going to raise the federal minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour. We are going to provide equal pay for equal work for women. We are going to make it easier for workers to join unions. We’re going to create millions of good paying union jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure. And building the 10 million units of low income and affordable housing this country desperately needs. We’re going to win this election because we believe in education. We are going to have high quality, affordable universal childcare. We are going to triple funding for low income Title 1 schools. And we need great teachers in this country. We need more Latino teachers. We need more African American teachers. And because we know the vitally important work that teachers do, we’re going to fight to make sure that no teacher in America earns less than $60,000 a year. And because we believe education, we believe that all of our people, regardless of their income are entitled to a higher education. And that is why we’re going to make public colleges and universities tuition free. And we’re going to cancel all student debt in this country by imposing a modest tax on Wall Street speculation. 12 years ago we bailed out the crooks on Wall Street, now it is their turn to help the working families in this country. And together, we are going to end the international embarrassment of the United States of America, our great country, being the only major country on Earth not to guarantee healthcare to all people. So let me be as clear as I can be. Healthcare is a human right, not a privilege. We are going to end the absurd situation in which we now are spending twice as much per person on healthcare as the people of any other country, yet 87 million of us are uninsured or under insured, 30,000 die each year and 500,000 people go bankrupt because of medically related debt. In America, you should not go bankrupt because you’re struggling with cancer. The function of a rational and humane healthcare system is to guarantee healthcare to all, not make 100 billion in profits for the drug companies and the insurance companies. And we are going to take on the greed and corruption of the pharmaceutical industry. Under our administration, the American people will not pay in some cases, 10 times more for the same prescription drugs sold in Mexico, Canada, or in Europe. And when we talk about the major crises facing this country, it is a sad state of affairs when we have a President of the United States who believes that climate change is a hoax. Well the scientific community has a slight disagreement with Mr. Trump. They think that climate change is an existential threat to this planet. And our administration believes in science, not right wing extremism. And that is why together we are going to adopt the principles of the Green New Deal. Which creates up to 20 million good paying jobs as we transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. Brothers and sisters, this is a moral issue. We must make sure that the planet we leave our children and grandchildren is a planet that is healthy and habitable. And when we talk about issues that must be dealt with, we in fact are going to reform a broken and racist criminal justice system. We do not want to continue a situation where we have more people in jail than any other country, including China four times our size. And the people in jail are disproportionately African American, Latino and Native American. And that is why we are going to invest in our young people in jobs, in education. Not more jails and incarceration. That is why we are going to end private prisons and detention centers. That is why we are going to end the war on drugs and legalize marijuana in every state is this country. Bernie, Bernie, Bernie …. Let me ask you all a question, let me ask you a serious question. How many people in this room tonight know somebody who was arrested for possession of marijuana? We are going to move forward to expunge the records of those arrested for possession of marijuana. And when we talk about broken and racist systems, we are going to bring about fundamental reform to our immigration system. I am the son of an immigrant. My father came to this country from Poland without a nickel in his pocket, couldn’t speak a word of English, had very little education. I know something about the immigrant experience. Together, we are going to end the demonization of the undocumented in this country. On our first day in office through executive order, we rescind all of Trump’s racist immigration executive orders. On our first day in office through executive order, we restore the legal status of the 1.8 million young people and their parents eligible for DACA. On our first day in office we end a border policy, which today allows federal agents to grab babies from the arms of their mothers. And throw children into cages. That is not what America is about. And together we will do what the American people have wanted to do for years and that is pass comprehensive immigration reform and a path towards citizenship. Earlier today, Jane and I were in El Paso at the memorial at that terrible shooting, terrible shooting in El Paso at the Walmart store there. And this is my promise to you, our gun safety legislation, which the American people want because they are disgusted by the amount of gun violence and mass killings in this country. Our gun safety legislation will be written by the American people, not the NRA. We will have universal background checks. We will end the gun show loophole. And we will do what the American people want and that is end the sale and distribution of assault weapons in this country. I am a United States Senator and I am on the floor of the Senate very often listening to speeches from Republican conservatives. And as you know their mantra, what they talk about all the time is that they believe in small government. They believe in getting the government off the backs of the American people. And what I say tonight to those hypocrites, if you believe in getting the government off the backs of the American people, understand that it is women who have a right to control their own bodies, not the government. And my promise to you is that I will never nominate anybody to the Supreme Court or the federal bench who is not 100% pro Roe v. Wade. We will codify Roe v. Wade, put it into law. And we will significantly expand funding for Planned Parenthood. As a United States Senator, I do understand the power of the corporate elite and the one percent. They have literally unlimited amounts of money. They have significant control over the media, over our economy, and over the political life of this country. But at the end of the day, the one percent is one percent. Now I don’t have a PhD in mathematics, but I do know that 99% is a heck of a lot bigger number than one percent. So what this campaign is about is understanding that if we do not allow Trump to divide us up by the color of our skin or where we were born, or our religion or our sexual orientation, if we stand together, if we fight for an agenda that works for working families and the middle class. If we get involved in the political process, if we stand for justice, if we stand for compassion, if we understand that we are all in this together. That my family has to care about your family, your family cares about my family. Brothers and sisters, if we stand together, we will not only defeat Trump, we will transform this country and create a government and an economy that works for all of us, not wealthy campaign contributors. Thank you all very much. Now we’re going onto South Carolina and win and then we’re going to take this back. I want to thank everyone who caucused for us, but I particularly want to thank the precinct captains, all our volunteers that are here. All the people who made all those phone calls. By the way, I plan on coming back to win this state outright. Look, I couldn’t have done it without … I want to start off, I got to recognize a few of the congresspersons here. Dina Titus has been incredible. Incredible There’s a guy named Horsford. Yeah. That man can campaign, man. I know, I see him right there. You kidding me? You kidding me? And also there’s a fellow named Cardenas from that little state called California’s [crosstalk 00:01:02]. Where is he? And Phil [Velve 00:00:01:08]. Phil, Thank you. Thank you for coming from Texas. Right there. And Hillis DeLace. She was just here. She was just there. Maybe she’s coming back here. Okay. And so, so, so many of you. I tell you what, man. The comeback kid. Well, you got it. You’re sending me back. I want to tell you something. And we’re in labor’s house, man. Labor’s house. The IBEW stepped up in a big, big, big, big, big, big way, as did a bunch of you. Look, we got to some of the best union support, I think, better than anybody in the whole damn state. But look, I heard there’s some guys called firefighters around here. They’ve been with us. ATU, iron workers, and by the way, I heard that we probably did awful well with culinary workers. Look, I know we don’t have the final results yet, but I feel really good. You’ve me in a position. The press is a ready to declare people dead quickly, but we’re alive and we’re coming back and we’re going to win. By the way, I want to thank all the folks at 226. They’ve been incredible to me. They’ve been incredible the way they’ve treated me. And, I want to tell you that the choices that they had to make were ones that made a big difference. Look, I want to get right to the point here. I think we’re in a position now to move on in a way that we haven’t been until this moment. I think we’re going to go, we’re going to win. We’re going to win in South Carolina. And then, Super Tuesday and we are on our way. Look, we’re here at an IBEW Hall and I want to tell you, they stepped up in a moment like at the … just the incredible right moment. And with that, the iron workers, firefighters, teachers, culinary, the ATU and so many others. I’ve said a hundred times, you’re the reason why I’m in this. You’re the ones who built the middle-class. You’re the ones who bought us back. And by the way, this time when we rebuild the middle class, we got to bring everybody along, everybody along, black, brown, women, men, straight, across the board. The idea that somehow people are just figuring this out kind of surprises me, but everybody’s just looking for a shot. No one’s looking for a handout. Everybody’s looking for just an even shot and they don’t feel like they’re getting a chance because they’re not. They’re being left behind. But I promise you, I give you my word as a Biden, I’m going to bring everybody along this time. Everybody along. That single mom’s trying to raise her kids by herself. It’s hard. That 50-year-old dad who just lost his job and he has no idea where to turn, or that college grad who can’t get started because his student debt is so high, for those communities of color that have had pollution pumped into their water that they drink and the air they breathe. You know, couples facing eviction will do anything, anything at all, to be able to maintain a home for their kids, or for the family that has a child with cancer and is desperately looking for help. We can fix all of these problems. Every one of them. Well, we can. It’s within our power to do it. And folks, the 100 million Americans with preexisting conditions who live in fear every day that Obamacare’s going to be taken away, I promise you it will not be. It will be expanded on where everybody will be able to have it. And for the immigrant who’s been demonized and the way this guy has ripped us apart in ways that we haven’t seen in any of our lifetimes, folks, we have such an incredible opportunity. I really mean this. We have such an incredible opportunity to take this country places it’s never been, lead the world again. Look, I believe that we’re … I’m a Democrat for a simple reason. I ain’t a socialist. I ain’t a plutocrat. I’m a Democrat. I’m a Democrat. Okay? And I’m proud of it. Look, you got to remember what made you become a Democrat in the first place. Basically, you thought everybody just deserves a shot. I really mean it. Just a shot, an even playing field. Just give us a chance. We can do anything at all, in the neighborhoods I come from and a lot of you come from. Anything at all. We’ve never, ever, ever, ever, ever let the country down. And by the way, I was proud to have and run with Barack Obama. And I’m proud to still be his friend. And I tell you what, I promise you, I wasn’t talking about running a Democratic primary against him in 2012 [crosstalk 00:07:23]. I was working my heart out so he could win. Folks, look. We can reestablish our place in the world. We can reestablish our place for ordinary, hardworking people in this country. And you know, we said it many times, with four years of Donald Trump, we can, God willing, if we win, we can make that an aberration, historical aberration. No, we can. But eight years will fundamentally change who we are. As I said again, many times to you all, we not only have to beat Donald Trump, we have to keep the United States House of Representatives, we have to win the United States Senate. Then, we have to bring the party and the country together. So I think it’s time. I think it’s time we get moving. I think it’s time we step up. Your time. Biden time. I’m counting on it being Biden time. We can bring it together. We can bring it together with your help. Jill for First Lady. Well, I tell you what … I tell you what I’m hearing. I’m hearing Dr. Jill for President where I go. Do you know what I mean? I tell you what. Look, you’ve all been so wonderful. I don’t want to keep you standing, but this is an important moment, an important moment. I think we’re going to look back on this and say this was the beginning of the fundamental change. Folks, folks, we’re in a spot now where we have to just keep moving. Keep moving and make sure. By the way, as you learned today and yesterday, the day before, we’re going to have more help coming from Vladimir Putin for our President. We’re going to have more help from Vladimir Putin who wants somebody who doesn’t think can beat Trump. We’re going to have more help along the way. And I turned out a couple of TV ads and I said, “Where the hell did that one come from?” And the staff looked at me and said, “That is Trump ad, they’re ads.” And so I want to … Let’s give Trump exactly what he doesn’t want. Let’s give him you and Joe Biden as the nominee [crosstalk 00:09:50]. Folks, thank you, thank you, thank you. I plan on coming back. By the way, one last thing. I want to ask everybody out there, tell all your friends, go to joebiden. Thank you Assemblywoman [inaudible 00:00:03]. Thank you Congressman Brown. Thank you to Chasten, my love, who got a little more than he bargained for on that first date. Thank you to are phenomenal leadership team, to our Nevada supporters, and thank you to all of you for making this a great day for our campaign here in Nevada [inaudible 00:00:25]. To those who questioned whether a Midwestern mayor could gather a national movement around a new kind of politics, you are the answer. And to everyone who believes in what we’re building, this is your night. This is your campaign. It belongs to the most talented and energetic and kind team of organizers and staff and volunteers that I have ever seen. It belongs to the nearly one million grassroots supporters who have gone, yes, to peteforamerica.com and who I’m hoping will help us raise that $13 million we need by super Tuesday to stay competitive and make sure we succeed. It belongs to the students and the entrepreneurs, to the veterans and the culinary workers, to the people of every religion and of no religion who agree that God does not belong to a political party in the United Sates. It belongs to the dreamers. The [foreign language 00:01:55] wondering whether this country will ever be their own. [foreign language 00:02:03]. You belong in this country. This campaign belongs to everyone ready, not only to end the era of Donald Trump, but to launch the era that must come next. Now, that bright, bright future lies before us, but it is far from certain. It will come only if we get this nomination right. And so we are moving on from the battle born state with a battle on our hands. I congratulate my competitors on a vigorous campaign here in Nevada, and I congratulate Senator Sanders on a strong showing today, knowing that we celebrate many of the same ideals. But before we rush to nominate Senator Sanders in our one shot to take on this president, let us take a sober look at what is at stake for our party, for our values, and for those with the most to lose. There is so much on the line and one thing we know for sure is that we absolutely must defeat Donald Trump and everything that he represents in America. This is important. We share these ideals, but I believe the best way to defeat Donald Trump and deliver for the American people is to broaden and galvanize the majority that supports us on the critical issues. Senator Sanders believes in an inflexible ideological revolution that leaves out most Democrats, not to mention most Americans. I believe we can defeat Trump and deliver for the American people by empowering the American people to make their own healthcare choices with Medicare for all who want it. Senator Sanders believes in taking away that choice, removing people from having the option of a private plan and replacing it with a public plan whether you want it or not. I believe that we can bring an end to corporate recklessness and rebalance our economy by empowering workers, raising wages, and insisting that those who gained the most must contribute the most in order to keep the American dream going forward. But that is different from Senator Sanders vision of capitalism as the root of all evil, that would go beyond reform and reorder the economy in ways that most Democrats, not to mention most Americans, don’t support. I believe we need to defeat Donald Trump and turn the page on this era in our politics by establishing a tone of belonging, bringing an end to the viciousness and the bullying that is tearing apart our country. We must change what it feels like to live in the United States of America. That is a real difference from Senator Sanders revolution with the tenor of combat and division and polarization leading to a future where whoever wins the day, nothing changes the toxic tone of our politics. I believe the only way to truly deliver any of the progressive changes that we care about is to be a nominee who actually gives a damn about the effect you are having from the top of the ticket on those critical frontline house and senate democrats that we need to win. The presidency is not the only office that matters, and we have got to support those frontline races because we need them to win in order to make sure that this agenda that we have is more than just words on a page. And it is different from Senator Sanders willingness to ignore or dismiss or even attack the very Democrats that we absolutely must send to Capitol Hill, because we must send them there to keep Nancy Pelosi as speaker, to support judges who respect privacy and democracy, and to send Mitch McConnell into retirement. Let us listen to what they are telling us, and support them from the top of the ticket. It is too important. Pete, Pete, Pete, Pete, Pete, Pete, Pete. That is the choice in front of us. We can prioritize either ideological purity or inclusive victory. We can either call people names online or we can call them into our movement. We can either tighten a narrow and hardcore base, or open the tent to a new and broad and big hearted American coalition. This is our shot. This is our only shot to beat Donald Trump. So I am asking Americans to make sure that we get this choice right. Now, ours is the only campaign that has beaten Senator Sanders anywhere in the country during this presidential cycle. And here’s how we did it. By bringing in new voters, by running strong across age and gender and ideology, by reaching into cities and suburbs and rural communities alike. We’ve done it not by consolidating one extreme faction, but by growing an American majority that is united, not only over who it is we’re against, but in what it is that we are for. Ours is a coalition hungry for action. If we mobilize fellow Americans as allies instead of pushing them into adversaries, we have shown that we can turn the page on our broken politics without turning off most Americans from our policies. And that is that support of Americans from all walks of life that has fueled our campaign. From those first contributions that helped us make it to be among the 20 candidates invited to the first debate stage, to the hundreds of thousands who have joined us since. From our grassroots donors to our amazing volunteers. Our tent welcomes supporters like the 16 year old in Las Vegas, not even old enough to vote, and a woman in Pahrump who hasn’t been involved in politics since JFK was running. It’s the student in Orangeburg who wants greater funding for HBCUs and the grandmother in New Hampton who is passionate about addressing our climate emergency. It is the inspiring young Latino lawmaker who survived a massacre and made it her mission to see that Nevada enacted the kind of common sense gun reforms that we need across the United States of America. We speak to Democrats, to independents, and even to Republicans who can no longer look their children in the eye and explain this president, who we are now delighted to call former Republicans, and sometimes even precinct captains for this campaign. You are welcome in this house. So if you’re ready for that future when there’s no such thing as an uninsured American or an unaffordable prescription, this campaign is for you. If you believe, like the mother and fast food worker that I got to march with in Charleston seeking a fair wage so she could afford her son’s medication, if you believe that one job ought to be enough in this country, this campaign is for you. If you were among the Americans I have met from farmers in rural Iowa to Nevadans forging a clean energy future to act as a nation on climate before it is too late, this is the campaign for you. If you know we must act in our time so that your race has no bearing on your health or your wealth or your experience with law enforcement in the United States of America, this campaign is for you. If you are for honoring our troops by seeing to it that they are never sent into endless war and never abandoned when they return, this is the campaign for you. If you believe that our country will be a better place if we honor our teachers a little more like soldiers, and pay them a little more like doctors, this campaign is for you. If you believe in a democracy where every vote is counted and every voter counts, where nobody wins a political race by discriminating on the basis of race, this campaign is for you. In other words, if you are ready to get to work to send Donald Trump packing and start healing this nation, this campaign is for you. Buttigieg, Buttigieg, Buttigieg, Buttigieg, Buttigieg, Buttigieg, Buttigieg, Buttigieg, Buttigieg. I feel such joy when I think about the America that we are building, one that lifts people up instead of bringing them down, one that calls for leaders to walk in the way of decency and humility, knowing that the purpose of the presidency is not the glorification of the president, it is the unification and the empowerment to the American people. I saw that unity. I saw that empowerment. I saw that illumination beautifully symbolized right here in Nevada last summer during what was very literally one of the darkest moments of this campaign. We were near Reno. We were in Sparks at the high school middle of my remarks, the power went out completely. I was talking to a dark room, speaking as loud as I could, no microphone, trying to make myself heard. And it took a moment, but then something happened. Somebody held up the screen of their iPhone, and then another, and then another. Holding up their lit phones together until the whole room was lit up. And from where I was standing, I couldn’t see who was behind each light, who was young and who was old, who was white, and who was black and who was Latino and who was Asian and who was native and who was standing on two feet and who was in a wheelchair. I just saw each little light, and knew that behind it was an American who saw when the lights went out and knew right away what to do about it. It just took one person, one person started it and then a bunch of others began to do the same and if we can light up a high school gym like that, then we can light up a neighborhood. And if we can light up a neighborhoods, then we can light up a city. If we can light up a city, we can light up this whole country, and if we light up this country then everyone can make sure this country we love shines as a beacon around the world once more. So I’m asking you to join us in spreading that hope. Join us in lighting up this room, because that is the hope that will move America forward. That is the hope that makes us hopefuls when we run for office and when we help those who do. It’s the hope that makes it possible for us to stand here in a room together with a candidate for president, his husband at his side, and people from all walks of life united in a common vision for the future. Join us in building that American life shaped by [inaudible 00:00:17:08]. Join us in creating that American future that faces our challenges with boldness and unity, and together we will light up this country in November. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Onto South Carolina, onto the nomination and onto the White House with your help. Thank you. Because he was running against someone who had a bigger bank account, right, who was more well known and he literally floored the country and that is exactly what we’re going to do in this campaign. So we left Nevada, although it’s raining right now there, but it was beautiful all week and we had such a great time, such hospitality. We have a great team down there still working hard. They’re counting the votes, but as usual I think we have exceeded expectations. I always note that a lot of people didn’t even think that I would still be standing at this point. They didn’t think I’d make it through that speech in the snow. They didn’t think I’d make it to the debate floor. But time and time again, because of all of you and because of the people around this country that wants something different than the guy in the White House, we have won. So I want you to know, first of all, our itinerary. We are headed of course to South Carolina. But on the way tomorrow we are going to Fargo. I challenge my opponents to do a rally in Fargo. We are doing one. We’re pretty excited about that. We are then going to Little Rock. We are then going to Oklahoma City, and then we go to South Carolina. So that is our plan. And I think you all know that not only is South Carolina a important state and where we’re going to have the next debate, but from there we go to Super Tuesday, and one third of America is going to be voting. And guess what one of the super Tuesday States is? That’s right. So John and I actually went and voted today and I was actually amazed at all the people there on a Saturday voting early. And so we recommend everyone vote early, but not often. So we want to thank you for doing that. And I would say, first of all, I think that people are starting to see that in today’s politics, and this really came to us out of New Hampshire, where the nation discovered me in a big way for the first time, that empathy, humility, decency matter, and that we have that in spades and also the toughness to beat Donald Trump. Because of you, we have proved the naysayers wrong every single time. Because of you, we have built a campaign as strong and resilient as the hard working Americans of our country. Because of you, we’re going to turn back the division and the exclusion, the meanness and the hate, and defeat Donald Trump this fall. That is our plan. Some believe that the way to beat Donald Trump is to be just as polarizing. No. No. And I think what we know is this, that Donald Trump’s worst nightmare is that the people in the middle, the people that are tired of the mud slinging and the name calling, will have a place to call home this November. And that has been our mission from the beginning. So if you’re working two jobs but still struggling to choose between medicine and rent, you have a home with me. If you’re frightened for your kids’ safety and sick of NRA lobbyists blocking gun violence laws, then you have a home with me. If you’re trying to raise a family and tired of corporate titans lining their pockets while you are sewing the holes in yours, you have a home with me. And if you think it is shameful that an American can be stopped and profiled because of the color of his skin, if you’re sick of a President that sees diversity as a weakness rather than our country’s great strength, then you have a home with me. There is something else that I’ve been fighting for and that is to bring heart back to the White House, to restore that basic empathy, that fundamental decency that’s been under siege since this president wrote his first toxic tweet. That was many tweets ago. I’m talking about a President who bragged about the size of his rallies while visiting a Texas hospital after a gunman killed 22 people at a local Walmart. I’m talking about a President who sided with the murderous dictator, Kim Jong-Un after a 22-year-old American student died in North Korea in their custody for trying to take a poster from a hotel. I’m talking about a President who separated innocent immigrant children from their parents and tried to deny them toothbrushes and soap and showers and then said, and I quote, “You have to take the children away.” Well, you can quote me on this. We have to take this President away. And if you think we can’t do it, if you think that we don’t have the grit, the resilience to turn the page on the racism, on the sexism, on the cronyism and the corruption, just remember that the day after this President took office, millions of people marched in protest all across this country, including in this city, including where I’m going tomorrow, to North Dakota and to Oklahoma and to Arkansas and to South Carolina. And then what happened? Thousands of women signed up to run for office. We were not just resisting. We were insisting on a better way forward. That summer as that President tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act and its protections for families, millions stood up and said no. And with that mandate, we handed him a crushing defeat. We were not just resisting. We were insisting on a better way forward. In 2018 what happened? Well, we saw the highest voter turnout in a midterm election in 50 years. Women, people of color all ran for office and won big. And we turned the House of Representatives back into the people’s house again. That’s what we did. So don’t go telling me we can’t do this. Don’t go telling me because what I see, is that we’re not just resisting, we’re insisting on a better way forward. And when I go to our rallies all over the country, what do I see? We were just in Aurora, Colorado. What do I see? A fired up Democratic base, big time. But I also see, at least in my rallies, other people joining us, Independents, moderate Republicans, people that say, “We want to be part of this.” And what we do is we say this, “We don’t want to shut people out. We want to bring people with us.” So Donald Trump can count us out if he wants. By the way, for the first time ever, he mentioned me at a rally. Yes. You know I’ve arrived now. You know they must be worried. And so as you see all these attacks, you’re going to see it, against me, just remember, it is a badge of honor. It means that we are gaining, that we are gaining in every single state in this country. And I am here to serve Donald Trump notice. I have won every race, every place, every time. I have won in 42 counties, flipped them, that he was so proud when he won them, and then I came roaring back in our own state. I have won every single congressional district in this state every time. And when you look at those swing States, you look in the middle of the country where we need to win, states like Pennsylvania, where a poll just showed me beating him by seven points, you look at that, you look at those states like Pennsylvania and Michigan and Wisconsin and Ohio and Iowa and yes, our own state. And what are we going to do? We are going to build a beautiful blue wall of Democratic votes around those states and we’re going to make Donald Trump pay for it. It is because of you that we are going to get this done, and you know how much I like to get things done. I really do, and I like to do it the right way. And I think it not only tells you something about how you campaign when you bring people with you, it tells people how you’re going to govern because the work of governing isn’t always glamorous. The work of governing is not always about standing in the corner of a boxing ring and throwing jabs. The work of governing is about standing next to someone you don’t always agree with for the betterment of this country. That is what governing is about. That is how we’re going to do this. That is how we’re going to lift up everyone in this country. People who feel locked out of the American Dream. Because I can tell you this, after what we saw in the last week of this President, after what we saw of him making mincemeat of the rule of law, of what we saw of him a few weeks back, having escorted Lieutenant Colonel Vindman out of that White House, with what we saw of him now claiming he’s going to purge people in the intelligence community from his administration, the rule of law cannot tolerate four more years of a President who thinks he’s above it. Our democracy cannot tolerate four more years of a president who thinks he can bulldoze through it, and the American Dream cannot tolerate four more years of a President who thinks he can choose who lives it. So I am asking you to keep up the work. You have been making calls from me. You have been volunteering, you have been calling all over this country from our international headquarters here. I put these headquarters here for a reason, because I think the middle of the country matters. I think that states that sometimes are considered fly-over country matter. I think we leave no one and no place behind. I go not just where it is comfortable. I go where it’s uncomfortable. I believe in bringing people with me. It is literally the opposite of Donald Trump. So we’re going to get on that green bus, a la Paul Wellstone, we are going to get on that green bus and I think I’ll end with a story about Paul. It’s my favorite one, and it’s about that last year of his life when we so tragically lost him and Sheila and David’s sister and their beloved staff in that plane crash. But what I remember about that year is, yeah, that day. But I remember something else. Paul had told our whole state that he had MS, and so he could never run back and forth in those parades like he used to always do. Instead, he would stand on that back of that bus and he would wave in those parades. He couldn’t run anymore. But here was the coolest part. He had energized so many people in those green shirts to run around that bus in endless motion that you didn’t even notice he wasn’t running himself. That’s I’m asking you to do for me. Not literally run around the bus America, but help us @amyklobuchar.com, and help us by making those calls, by talking to your neighbors, because we don’t just want to eke by a victory at 4:00 a.m. We want to win big. We want to win this for the people of this country. We want to win this for dignity and decency, and we want to win this big and get our Democracy back. Let’s go to work and do this. Thank you everybody. Thank you. I want to talk specifically for just a minute at the top about a threat that is coming our way, and it’s a big threat. Not a tall one, but a big one. Michael Bloomberg. Now this is important to pay attention to now, because he has skipped the first four states and he plans to come in on Super Tuesday and immediately afterwards, here in Washington, drop hundreds of millions of dollars and buy this election. He argues that he is the safest bet to beat Donald Trump. He’s not safe, he’s just rich. And here’s the problem. He’s hiding his taxes. He doesn’t want you to see them until after the election. Who knows what lurks there? He has a history now of harassing women and of gender discrimination, and he has defended racist policies like red lining and stop and frisk. So let’s think about that. Billionaire who hides his taxes, has a bad history with women and defends racist policies. Let me just put it this way, we’re not substituting one arrogant billionaire for another in 2020. Because here’s the thing, Michael Bloomberg is not the safest candidate. Michael Bloomberg is the riskiest candidate for the Democrats because he cannot win against Donald Trump. This election is not for sale. We are going to make this election about democracy, about you. That’s what this is about.   The rest of the speeches are currently being transcribed, thank you for your patience"
"28","02-22-21"," Good afternoon. I just had an opportunity to catch up with two small business owners who I met on the road, in the last couple weeks. And the first was a very entrepreneurial woman named [Pilar Guzman Zavala 00:00:23], and she’s from Florida, Miami, and [Tim Eichinger 00:00:30], who is in Wisconsin. They have different businesses and live in different places, but both shared the same message with me when I spoke to them on the road. And that was American small businesses are hurting and hurting badly, and they need help now. And it’s in all of our interest to make sure they get the help now. Small businesses are the engines of our economic progress. They’re the glue and the heart and soul of our communities, but they’re getting crushed. Since the beginning of this pandemic, 400,000 small businesses have closed, 400,000, and millions more are hanging by a thread. It’s hurting Black, Latino, and Asian American communities the hardest. Walk down any main street, and you see it, empty storefronts, goodbye signs hanging in the windows. Maybe it’s the pizza place you used to take your family to dinner or the hardware store that always had the tool you needed. It’s the mom and pop shop that is supported by the community, and then in turn, they support the community. They sponsor Little League teams. The barbershop with the first dollar bill that he or she earned still taped to the wall, along with a picture of their kids who are now in college, these small businesses, not the ones with 500 employees, but these small businesses that, with a handful of folks, they are 90% of the businesses in America. But when the Paycheck Protection Program was passed, a lot of these mom and pop businesses got muscled out of the way by bigger companies who jumped in front of the line. And I want to be clear. The Paycheck Protection Program is a bipartisan effort. Democrats and Republicans helped pass it. But Democrats and Republicans have also voiced concerns about improving it. With their input, that’s what we’re doing in our administration, improving it. In the last month, we’ve increased the share of funding for small businesses with fewer than 10 employees by nearly 60%. For businesses in rural communities, the share of funding is up nearly 30%, since we came to office. And the share of funding distributed through banks that traditionally help minority-owned businesses is up more than 40%. And today, I’m announcing additional changes to the PPP program that will make sure we look out for the mom and pop business, even more than we already have. As I explained to Pilar and Tim, the two small business people I spoke to, on Wednesday, the Small Business Administration is going to establish a 14-day, exclusive PPP loan application period for businesses and nonprofits with fewer than 20 employees. People can go out and find out how to get ahold of these loans. People can find out more at the sba.gov. Small Business Administration will also remove barriers that have stopped many businesses from being able to apply for these loans. For example, we’re making it so that a student loan default or a non-fraud-related criminal record does not prohibit someone from applying for the program. We’re also making it easy for those one-person businesses, like the home repair contractors, beauticians, small, independent retailers to secure forgivable PPP loans. At the same time, we’re increasing access by increasing oversight. I invite any inspector general in this program, with jurisdiction over this program, to closely look at these loans and publicly report on any issues they uncover inconsistent with what I’m saying today. We will ensure every dollar is spent well. These changes will bring much needed, long overdue to help to small businesses who really need help staying open, maintaining jobs, and making ends meet. And this is a starting point, not the ending point. We need Congress to pass my American Rescue Plan. It deals with the immediate crisis facing our small businesses. Now, critics say the plan is too big. Well, let me ask them a rhetorical question. What would you have me cut? What would you leave out? The American Rescue Plan targets $50 billion to support the hardest hit small businesses, after this program expires at the end of March. One of the things I’ve heard, again and again, from small business owners like Pilar and Tim is that knowing about support is one thing. Gaining access to getting it is another. That’s why we proposed $175 million to bring community organizations in to serve as navigators who will help them through this process of application. We would also establish a hotline, with help available in multiple languages, so folks can pick up a phone and get the help they need to stay open and serve their community. Again, the critics, it’s too big. Should we stop spending money on them? Do we not want a return on the investment that we make in these businesses, to be able to stay open and thrive and pay back? Why would we not want to make sure small business who lack teams of lawyers, bankers, and accountants have an advocate, someone they can rely on to direct them to help that will be there for them? The American Rescue Plan is a rescue plan for America’s small businesses and America’s mainstream businesses, and we need Congress to pass it right away. I’m grateful to the Senate, and the House for moving so quickly. And I want to make it clear. I’m prepared to hear ideas about how to make the American Rescue Plan better and cheaper, but we have to make clear who we’re helping and who it would hurt. I always try to help people like Tim and Pilar and all the country’s small businesses and families, the workers, the communities that depend on them to survive, recover, and grow. And it’s my hope that as Democrats and Republicans who have backed the PPP program, that Democrats and Republicans will back the American Rescue Plan. The vast majority of the American people, more than 70% of the American people, including a majority of Republicans, want us to act based on all the polling data, act big and act quickly. Major economists, left, right, and center, here and abroad, say we should focus on smart investments that can make jobs available and focus on the jobs and in the people, prevent loss to prevent longterm economic damage to our nation and to strengthen the economic competitiveness going forward. In fact, an analysis by Wall Street’s firm Moody’s estimates that if we pass my American Rescue Plan, the economy will create 7 million jobs this year. This year. We’re also been in constant contact with the mayors and governors, county officials, members of Congress of both parties, in every state. That includes a letter, I might add, from more than 400 mayors from big and small cities, Democrat and Republican. They agree we have to act and act now. They understand we’re not going to get our economy back in shape and the millions of people back to work until we beat this virus. Getting our economy back means bringing our small businesses back, and that’s what we’re going to do. That’s what I’m doing today. We’re going to focus. The program ends at the end of March, but for the next two weeks, the only folks who can apply for that PPP money are businesses with fewer than 20 employees. Thank you very much."
"29","02-23-21"," A disproportionate number of black Americans serve as front line workers and as first responders, putting yourselves at greater risk of contracting COVID-19. And one in four deaths from COVID-19 have been those of black Americans. And so during this Black History Month, we wanted to say thank you, to lift up your voices and your service and your needs. The President’s American Rescue Plan, if passed by Congress, will bring an end to this pandemic and it will invest in you and your fellow front line workers and all Americans so we can keep ourselves safe and rebuild our economy so that it works for everyone. Mr. [inaudible 00:00:00] Mr. President. Al is a firefighter and EMT in St. Louis, Missouri. And we have Melanie Owens, a pharmacist in Chicago; Carmen Palmer, a childcare worker in Columbus, Ohio; and Jeff Carter, a grocery store manager in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Thank you all so much for being here today and for sharing your stories with us. Mr. President, over to you. Well, thanks for joining us, everyone. I’ve met Al before and Al, thank you for all the help in the past. And we’re going to try and help now, you and the firefighters and EMTs. Yes. Well, that’s pretty impressive. That’s pretty impressive. And Carmen, you do God’s work, dealing with all those little kids and trying to figure out how you do it now and how you can safely open and how you can make it work. I guess, it’s a pleasure dealing with children. Well, I’ll tell you what. We need you badly. And Jeff, you have too damn many Hy-Vees around the state. I mean, I tell you what. It was always a debate whether I stopped at a Hy-Vee or whether I find a frozen custard stand. But that’s what we did in Iowa. But all kidding aside, you all are basically holding the country together. I’m not being facetious. I’m being deadly earnest. You can see the looks on people’s faces when they walk into your drugstore and they stand at the counter and they ask for a prescription, can’t you? You can see the fear in their eyes, especially if they’ve gotten an unwelcome analysis like two of your family members have, Al. And so what I want to do today is I want you to know there’s that old bad joke, “I’m from the federal government, I’m here to help.” But we are from the federal government and we want to help. I want to help a lot. There hasn’t been, most states, you’re from four different states, and we got St. Louis, Chicago, Columbus, and Cedar Rapids. And every state, as you know, has a slightly different approach to how to deal with COVID right now. And we’re trying to make sure they get all that they need, each of those states, and we’re focusing, as the former ambassador said, we’re focusing on the needs particularly of the most left behind community, the African-American community. It really is across the board. But on this area specifically. As, I might add, are the Latino communities, being left behind. Not as much, but similarly. And Pacific Islanders. So there’s a lot of work to do, and that’s why we want to talk to you, is to see whether we’re headed in the right direction. So I’m here, eager to hear what’s on their minds, Susan. See what you’re thinking. What you think we should be doing. And now, I know the guy from Iowa, Jeff, he’ll ask any questions because Iowans are so spoiled. They can ask every presidential candidate. “Come on, can you come over hear and sit down with me for a few minutes. I want to talk to you. Right. So you know me. But all kidding aside, I’m anxious to hear what’s on your mind, what you think we should be doing. And then maybe in the process ask a few questions and tell you the kinds of things we’re doing to try to deal with what are, we think, I hope, are the problems of the people who are keeping us floating. You’re the ones that keep us going. Not a joke. You are the ones that keep us going. And kept the country going. You’re carrying it on your back. And so thank you for what you’ve done so far. We got a lot more to do. Thank you, Mr. President. I’d like to begin by introducing our first speaker, Demetrius “Al” Alfred. We’d like to hear from each of you about your experiences during COVID, but Al, first I’d like to ask you to tell us about yourself. You’re a 30-year firefighter and EMT in St. Louis. You’re the president of your local union and president, also, of the Missouri State Council of Firefighters. You and your fellow workers have been through a great deal, and we’d love to hear your experiences over the last couple years. Before you start, you heard that old expression, “God made man, then he made a few firefighters.” Thank you. Yes, sir. Yeah. Thank you, thank you. And good afternoon, Ambassador Rice and Mr. President. It’s a pleasure to be here and an honor to be able to speak to you, and good to see you again, Mr. President. We have met before and I enjoy your company every time. Let me start out by saying in St. Louis, the firefighters have had a tough time with COVID. Going on calls we’ve had to change up our direction on protocol a little bit with masking up and six feet social distancing. We’ve even changed the protocol that when we go on medical runs and calls, people trapped in a house, and even fires, we approach them a little bit different. We have to wear face masks. If we just talk about medical calls, we have to wear face masks and show up. And then we don’t send the entire crew in anymore. We’ll try to send in one guy to check out the situation. And if we can possibly get the patient to come inside and then do the assessment, and things like that. So we’ve really had to make some changes. We had to really look towards the government, local and state and federal, to try to get our PPE so we could go on these calls and protect ourselves and protect the citizens. And if you’re talking about the vaccine, we’ve been trying to get in line there here in Missouri and get as many guys vaccinated as possible so we can keep serving the community. But make no bones about it, St. Louis firefighters are here. We answer every call. We are resourceful and we adapt very well, and we’re ready to go. We just would like the support from federal government, local, and state to keep us afloat so we can have the equipment and things to keep us going to do our job. We’ll appreciate everything you guys can do for us. Al, let me ask you. We would like to make sure that we can get the funding down to the local level and to the fire departments in particular. So, like I said, we can still purchase the PPE to sustain us, get our equipment and things like that. And, most importantly, we’d like to get support so we wouldn’t have budget cuts or have to endure any pay cuts or layoff. That’s a big worry because, like I said, we respond to everything. We show up ready to go. Very resourceful, and we adapt very well. But then, after things are over, once the crisis has passed, it appears that sometimes the local government or management, however you want to look at it, find that the department may be easy to cut because the crisis is over. And that’s one of our biggest concerns. So you asked me if I had a magic wand, I would say that I’d wave that wand to make sure that we get the proper funding to sustain our jobs so we can respond and help the citizens of our community. Well, that’s what we do in this legislation we put together. And I hope, God, it’s going to pass. We provide for resources, 350 billion dollars for emergency funding for state, local, and territorial governments. Now we’ve got 340 million people in America. We got a big country. And so what’s happened is a lot of states have decided that they, because they have to balance their budgets, they can’t continue to spend the same amount of revenue they were spending before. And what’s happening is a lot of everything from firefighters to schoolteachers to a whole range of people are being laid off. We’re short 6,000 teachers, firefighters. And the only thing I know working with your outfit, Al, for so long, is that the only thing that keeps firefighters safe is more firefighters. Literally. Yes, sir. Literally. Yeah. And so you’re being cut. We also find, provide for 160 billion dollars for supplies. And that would be everything from making sure we can scale vaccine distribution and testing, make sure everybody can get in there and have an opportunity to get the test. EMTs and firefighters are, when we get that done, we’re going to have one less crisis you have to deal with. But look. The funds we’re talking about are designed to keep teachers and school workers on the job, including childcare, invest in personal protective equipment. I understand from a story I was told that you have the personal protective equipment in St. Louis but they don’t have it in Kansas City. The firefighters. Yes. And also to reduce… Just increase capacity across the board. So we owe you a lot. My family owes you a particularly lot. You literally, as you know when we talked, you saved my life. EMTs in my state saved my life. Got me down to a hospital in time to save my life. And my boys. Saved their lives, too. The jaws of life. Much earlier. So we owe you big. But what I want to do is make sure you… Get more specific with you and find out whether or not you have access to get in line. Last thing. States set the priorities for who gets the vaccine. We have now gone from having a shortage of vaccines to, by the end of July, we’ll have over 600 million doses of vaccine. Enough to take care of everybody in the country. And we’re moving, as Ms. Owens knows, we’re moving to make sure that drug stores, pharmacies, are going to be able to be a place, just like for flu shots, you can go. We’ve just gone from… Because we find that that’s more accessible to an awful lot of folks who don’t have the means to travel very far, don’t have the access to get to where they need to go, and they’re used to their pharmacy and they know their pharmacist. They can get a shot. And we’ve gone from this week, last week, one million doses to pharmacies to two million this week. So with the grace of God and the good will of neighbors we’re going to be able to significantly increase that. And Carmen, I’m pushing really hard, I mean this sincerely, for day cares to be able to open. And you need financial help to open. You can’t just open just straight up. But we’ll talk about that a little bit as we go on. I don’t want to take too much time at the front end here. So, look, Al, just don’t be shy about letting us know what you need. And what you need in Missouri is not fundamentally different than what people need in Kansas and people need in Iowa and people need in Illinois, et cetera. Absolutely, Mr. President. And you know our famous saying. We have your back. You have, man. As one of your guys said, “You have my back so much you’re breaking my shoulders.” Pushing him. That’s all right. Anyway, thank you, Al. Mr. President, next I’d like to introduce Melanie Owens. Melanie, as you know, is a pharmacist on the south side of Chicago. Melanie actually contracted COVID herself last March and has now been vaccinated, and she’s been administering vaccines to people in her community. Melanie, please give us a sense of your story. Hi, Mr. President, and thank you very much, Ambassador Rice. It is an honor and a privilege to be here with you, and thank you for allowing me to share a small part of my story. As she said, I am a pharmacist in the Bronzeville neighborhood on the south side of Chicago. I’m a pharmacy manager, and I began my career with Walgreens nearly 20 years ago. And it was the opportunity to help care for others in our communities that helped me become a pharmacist. And it didn’t hurt that both of my parents are pharmacists as well. I also have a sister who’s a nurse, and my brother [Eli 00:14:25] is an engineer for the fire department, so we’re all front line workers. I did contract COVID in March of 2020 when the tests weren’t readily available. So I was not able to get tested, but thankfully, with Walgreens, I was able to quarantine for 14 days with no interruption of work or pay. But my symptoms and subsequent antibody test did prove that I had COVID at that time, so I can really relate to what others are going through. And it has helped me to become more motivated than ever to do all I can to help the community during this pandemic. It’s been a really tough year for us but recently it’s been very rewarding to start being able to go to the longterm care facilities and vaccinate the residents there and also now it’s available in the stores. My pharmacy personally is in a low middle class, a predominantly black neighborhood and lots of the people are surprised that it’s very convenient and the ease of the vaccination process once they pass the scheduling portal so I just encourage everyone to be aware that the vaccine is here to help make sure that they are making their neighbors and friends and family aware of their experience as they get the shots taken care of and let them know that we are here to help them. Everyone had that assumption that they would have to go out far away to find the vaccine but I think it’s an awesome thing that we’re starting to roll it out in these communities, in all communities and hopefully it continues to become available. We also, Walgreens has started a health equity program in my store where we’re making it more convenient also for customers to get their prescriptions delivered to them or personal reminding calls to let them know that their prescriptions are ready so that they aren’t forgetting about the basics but they don’t have to worry about the social distancing and coming in contact with other people that they don’t want to leave their homes or uncomfortable. But I got my second vaccine February 5 and I just make sure I tell everybody that it was a wonderful experience. I feel very grateful to be able to have gotten it along with the longterm facility workers and I just want everybody to keep doing what they’re doing and make sure that we’re all doing what we need to do to get back to some kind of normalcy so President Biden, please keep rolling out the vaccine because it is helping to keep people alive and safe so with that I just want to say thank you again for this opportunity. I never thought I’d be able to speak directly with the President of the United States, and especially on Zoom, so thank you so much for that. Well thank you Melanie. Look, let me ask you a couple questions. You’re in the south side of Chicago, that’s where my kids’ grandparents are from. Awesome. People are … They don’t have a whole lot of money, and a lot of people don’t … It’s an older population these days. Yeah. One of the things that I’ve observed is that there is a reluctance to … They don’t know how to get online with you, a lot of people don’t know how to use that, they may not have a cellphone. They may not have the ability to know how to pick the phone up and get online and so they’re reluctant and so what I found is from the days when my dad was raising me was that sometimes people, when they don’t know what to do, they’re embarrassed to acknowledge they don’t know how to do it. They don’t know how to get it done. So how important do you think it is … One more piece of this. We also know because of the way American medicine has taken advantage of African-Americans for experimentation over the last 100 years that there’s a real reluctance that still exists in the African-American community to get the vaccination, even if it’s available. I’ve been pleading with people, get it. If you have a chance, get it. It will save not only your life potentially but it will save your family a little bit. So tell me about what you’ve sensed. I can tell you have a feel for this. I really mean it. Tell me what you sense from your patients who come in to get the shot. I would say that my customer base for the most part is very excited. We haven’t had many people come discussing whether or not we would get it ourselves or should they get it, it’s more when can they get it. I was more reluctant than most people … Most of my customers to get it actually but then it just kind of felt like an obligation when I started to go to longterm care facilities. I’m here to protect them, so I needed it, and just listening to my parents who are in their seventies so were so eager to get it and I was happy to be able to help them get it, it just … It helped to change my mind and I also had some administrative staff at the first longterm care facility that I went to change their mind based on me changing mine at their moment to get it so … I mean I think it’s just you can be fearful, you can have questions, but do your due diligence and figure out what is best for you and like I said earlier if this is a part of a major key of what’s going to help us move past this and go back to being able to live normally, I feel like we should do it. It’s no harm in it. Well we’ve been able to increase the supply to the states and just in the month we’ve been here by 57%. So they’re getting 57% more vaccine than they did before and we’re going to, God willing, we’re going to be in a position where we can significantly increase that as well so that … The other thing is, we have set up … We made another federal decision saying that we are going to use community health facilities, which usually take care of the folks who are the most in need and because they know where … I’m not being facetious when I say this, they know where the people sleeping under the bridge are. They know where people who are really in real dire straits who … They’re going out to get them to get them vaccinated so we’re helping that this helps. In addition, one of the things we’re going to be able to do is part of this investment is $20 billion in the national vaccination program. As you know the funding helps deploy community vaccinators and vaccination centers. You’re one of them, you’re in the community, that’s why … Some of the governors were not sure that’s the way to go, that we … And I’m not picking on any governor, I really mean it. They do not understand why we made the independent decision to send vaccines directly to 600 and some … 67 different drug chains or drug stores out there, why we send it directly to them and they weren’t sure why we are sending them directly to child care facilities. That’s what we’re going to try to do now and so … Because they thought they could better decide where to use it but I am determined to make sure we service the communities that are the ones that are the most victimized by … Victimized wrong word, most affected by, most affected by the COVID virus when they get it and the consequences of it. But I thank you for all you do and I really mean it and for going to those in those longterm care facilities and helping there as well so thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you Melanie. Mr. President, our third participant as you know is Carmen Palmer. Carmen is a childcare worker in Columbus, Ohio, but I say childcare worker but that really doesn’t do it justice. She does almost everything there is to do. That’s what I read. She runs the food program at the childcare center, she’s a substitute teacher, she’s a bus driver when needed, and she’s also the mother of two of her own young children. So Carmen, we’d love to hear your story. You obviously have a lot of spare time, Carmen. Of course. I just wanted to say thank you President Biden and Ambassador Rice for speaking with me and giving me this opportunity, I do appreciate that, [inaudible 00:23:53]. I am Carmen Palmer. You know I’m born and raised in Detroit, Michigan. I grew up in foster care and after graduating high school that’s when I decided for a better environment and I moved to Ohio and that’s where I found my home here at Kiddie Academy. I’ve been working here five years and as Ambassador Rice mentioned my two children both attend the childcare facility. I started working there as a toddler teacher and I was offered to share my skills in the kitchen as the kids will call me the school chef because I think it’s cool to cook sometimes. I thought that was rewarding just to combine my love for cooking and children and my role is to ensure not only our zero to five children eat but our school-agers as well. I love providing [inaudible 00:24:46] nutritious meals because I know what it’s like not to eat or know when my next meal is coming from especially growing up in foster care. I’m a single mother and COVID has exposed not only the flaws in the childcare system but how frail my personal situation is. I work every single day, you know, during the pandemic. I have not missed one day to try to take care of our families and our children who need care. Me personally, if I was to get COVID or my kids was to get COVID, I have no other options. I am one of the only states that has not prioritized childcare for the vaccine and that’s concerning to me because once again I work every single day in the pandemic and I’m … I’m an essential worker and I am taking care of essential workers’ kids. As a parent, I want to make sure I have child care and child care that is safe. [inaudible 00:25:48] have installed ionizers to improve our ventilation system and I can only assume that is working. We provide [inaudible 00:25:58], we are washing our hands, we social distance, we do temperature checks but it’s hard for the kids because they’re used to … “I want to go play with my friends,” we’re like, “No, you have to social distance. We have to keep our distance.” It’s hard keeping the younger kids who keep their masks up to protect themselves. Our enrollment is down and we are seeing less of our families because of the pandemic. They’re not working and they’re losing their jobs and I’m just really grateful that I’m able to still work during the pandemic and that’s important to me to keep my employment. Thank you Carmen. Well Carmen, look. This legislation which we think is going to pass is going to help childcare providers by allowing you to pay the rent, pay your utilities, your payroll if there is one, [inaudible 00:27:01] as well as increased costs associated with the pandemic. Those costs include PPE, you mentioned ventilation, paying for ventilation improvement, small group sizes, modifications to make physical environment, inside safer by providing more dividers. We’re also temporarily going to increase the childcare tax credit. Right now if you make over a certain amount of money, you will get a tax credit of $2,000.00 now. We’re going to raise that to $3, 000.00 per child and $3, 600. 00 per child under the age of six and make it refundable which is the big deal because if you’re not making a lot of money and not paying taxes, you may have two or three kids, you don’t get any help at all but now what will happen is, if this passes, they will get a refundable credit for each child, if they’re under six, $3,600. 00 check from the federal government. The same thing for the $2,000. 00 and so on. They say we’ll cut … If we get this done, we’ll cut child poverty in half, but in addition to that, we’ll provide those parents with access to not only your day care center but others across the country, they would be able to afford it and we’re also making sure that we provide money for folks who are about to be thrown out of their homes or there’s millions of people out there who can’t pay the rent and so we’ve deferred any costs to have to pay the rent while this pandemic is going on because otherwise we’d just have … We’d be vastly increasing the homeless population which makes no sense. We know how important early childhood education and child development is and to get through this crisis I think we need to be sure childcare providers have the funding they need to stay afloat and you mentioned something Carmen that was really important. Most of these kids you’d be taking care of if they were going to kindergarten or preschool, they’d be getting a free lucnh program. Well we got to increase the amount of money available for what used to be called the food stamp program but it is not now but we got to make more … Make it available because did you ever think you’d see … [inaudible 00:29:41] in your hometown where you’d see miles of cars lined up in multiple lanes waiting for one box of food? This is the United States of America for God’s sake, and the idea there’s that much food insecurity is just not right. … if we get this bill passed, which we’re not going to pass by a lot, but we’re optimistic, we’re going to make some real changes, and the childcare centers are at risk of closing all around the country. It would have a tremendous impact on our families. Our families are telling us now that they can’t work, and it’s definitely hard to find childcare if you don’t have any employment. And then me as myself, I honestly wouldn’t know what I would do if I didn’t have childcare so I could go to work, because I have no family here. All my family is back home in Michigan. Okay, kiddo, keep doing what you’re doing. Thank you. As my mom would say, you’re doing God’s work, kid. Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, Carmen is also the only one with young kids in school. I thought it might be worth just asking her to say a few words about how her kids have fared in the pandemic with virtual schooling and then now hybrid schooling. Yes, I am. I actually made the joke with Ambassador Rice yesterday on saying, I really fear for my youngest son. He’s seven and he’s a thumb-sucker and I for sure knew he was going to get COVID because I’m like, “You just keep putting your hands in your mouth.” I enrolled them in virtual and then my oldest daughter, her grades, she started to struggle. I was like, “Okay, you needed the help.” So I switched her over to hybrid. So on Monday and Tuesdays, they attend school to get the help that they need, that one-on-one. And then Wednesdays and Thursdays and Fridays, they attend the daycare. And our teachers there are willing to help assist them with their hybrid learning. But sometimes, not only just my kids, but all the kids as well are dealing with their social-emotional needs of social distancing and really can’t go anywhere but just school and home. So we have to deal with those aspects of the kids as well. Well, an awful lot of children, as well as adults, are going through some real… They need some help in terms of depression and mental problems. I mean, we’re worried about their… They’re just so off. They don’t know exactly what’s going on and it has real impacts. That’s why we got to get them back into school. That’s why we have to open up these schools. By the way, a lot of you out there are struggling just to make ends meet, even if you have a job, but we’re going to make sure you get that extra $1,400 check during the pandemic, that both parties said they support it. Even the past president said he strongly supported it. We just got to get it done now. But it’ll make a difference and give you some just literally, some breathing room, just a little breathing room. That’s what we need to give people right now. Because everybody in this circumstance is being hurt. It’s through no fault of their own. It’s not their fault that the pandemic started. Well, thank you. You’re welcome, Mr. President. Thank you. Mr. President, last but by no means least, I wanted to introduce Jeff Carter. Jeff is the district store manager of two Hy-Vee grocery stores in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Jeff, we’d love to hear your story too. Thank you very much, Mr. President and Ambassador Rice. I really appreciate the opportunity that I’ve been given to speak with you and kind of tell my story a little bit. As I said, my name is Jeff Carter. I am married to my wife, Kim Carter and we’ve been married for about 25 years. I do have an older son. His name is Mason. He works as a finance officer in one of the major car dealerships here in Cedar Rapids. I work for Hy-Vee. Hy-Vee is a grocery store chain and we have stores in Iowa, and as you mentioned, Mr. I was teasing you. I know. But we’re a great company and really have appreciated the opportunity that I have to work for them. We employ over 88,000 employees. During this past year, the pandemic has really challenged us to not only focus on service to our customers and our employees, but also safety. We really had to shift our focus rapidly on how we take care of our customers, how we make sure that they are safe when they come in the stores. We were one of the first stores to install plexiglass shields to protect our employees and our customers. We also put directional arrows on our floors to create social distancing, so that people didn’t crowd and possibly spread the virus. In my store and all of our stores, we had employees that from the moment we opened until we closed, all they did was walk around the store and sanitize and clean, and clean contact areas that customers and employees touch just to make sure that the virus was limited in the possibility that it might spread. We also installed a system called Sterile Cart, that we could push our grocery carts through in order to sanitize them and make sure that our customers were safe. We mandated masks for all of our employees. We passed out millions of masks. I don’t know if millions, but thousands of masks to our customers to have in case they didn’t have their own when they came in our stores. We have a Mask-it-Up campaign, asking and requiring everybody to wear a mask when they come in our stores. Through all this, I’m very, very proud of all of the employees that I work with and employees of all of our stores because I don’t think we really consider ourselves frontline workers. As we are essential workers, when we’re doing our jobs, but as a lot of us talk from day-to-day, we felt that as many people that we were in contact with, for many of us, it wasn’t a matter if we were going to catch the virus, it was a matter of when we were going to catch the virus. But through all this, and many of our employees, they put themselves on the front lines. And they did not shy away from doing their job and taking care of our customers and making sure the needs were met. I think because of a lot of the systems that we put in place, we had cases where employees did catch the virus, but I think our numbers were surprisingly low because of some of the safety measures that we put in place. Through all that, many of our employees, some were a little bit concerned about going to work because they had maybe family members at home that had underlying health conditions that might put them at risk of catching the virus and possibly falling very sick, or worse, possible death. But they still came to work to help serve our customers and do their job. On top of that, in Cedar Rapids, on August 10th, we had a major weather event, called derecho, that rolled through our city. That was amazing. It was an amazing event that I had never ever witnessed, and I’d never even heard the word derecho prior to that. We had winds of up to 120 miles an hour go through and destroy property and trees. Many trees were lost. In fact, I actually have a campaign right now where we are, as Hy-Vee, we are getting thousands of trees into the city and surrounding areas, that we can replace those trees that were lost. Many homes were damaged. Many of our employees’ homes were damaged, but still, I think they put a lot of their personal concerns on the back burner, to still come in and help serve our customers. During this derecho, we also went out into our communities and helped pass out free goods, groceries and things like that to people in need. Many people were without power for approximately a week that the city was without power. We were doing whatever we could to help the community. So not only did we have the COVID to deal with, we also had a derecho that rolled through, which was another amazing challenge. But we still persevered, and very I’m proud and happy for the job that Hy-Vee and our employees were able to do, and customers alike. We all rallied together to get through this. So now, as I mentioned before, and part of that with the derecho, I have to mention that Ambassador Rice mentioned that I am in charge of two stores. I actually had three stores, but one of our stores was badly damaged in the derecho and we had to close it and tear it down because the damage was too far to repair the store. But we were able to relocate all the employees that worked at the store and now they are employed elsewhere at other stores. But now, I’d like to move forward with what I call, I think we’re in the recovery phase, I guess, of hopefully this virus. We’ve dealt with trying to hold it at bay, keep people from catching it. Now I think we’re in the phase of hopefully, vaccinating people so that we can move through this, so that hopefully one day we’ll be able to take down those plexiglass shields and get rid of these masks that we no longer have to wear, maybe give a customer a handshake or a hug, thanking them for coming in. And Hy-Vee is ready. We’re ready to help you, as Demetris said, we’ve got your back. Like I said, I have two stores, and like Melanie, we are vaccinating as well. We have just recently, sent our pharmacy team from one of my stores to a long-term care facility, and we vaccinated 120 senior citizens in that facility that had not been probably out of that facility for probably a year. And the stories that I got back from my pharmacy manager, telling me that people literally had tears in their eyes from the relief and the hope that they someday soon will be able to see their loved ones again, face-to-face, instead behind a window or a computer screen. Well, Mr. President, we have pharmacists, we have pharmacy techs, we have about nine mobile units ready to go out to the communities, to reach people that possibly cannot get the vaccine. We can go to them. We recently had an event at Drake University, that we vaccinated over 1,000 people. I think things like this, we are capable, we are ready to do to help you, because we have your back as well. I think what we really need is we have like I said, stores in multiple states. We just need to get the vaccine delivered so that we can go out and do our thing. We are ready to help. And once again, I very much appreciate this opportunity. It’s like a dream come true. It’s something I’ll cherish for the rest of my life. I’ll probably watch this video over and over again. Thank you very much. Jeff, it’s an honor for the Ambassador and me to be able to talk to you. Look, one of the things that the Ambassador and I made the decision early on to quote Franklin Roosevelt. I’m going to give it to you straight from the shoulder. I’m not going to play games. I’ll tell you when we do it right and I’ll tell you when we screwed up. And I’ll tell you we take responsibility. That’s what I think all of you are doing. You’re giving it straight to the people you’re working with and the people you’re trying to help. And we spend much too much time ignoring this. One of the things you’ve all mentioned is the PPE, the protective gear, and social distancing. I know that Melanie knows this as a pharmacist, and all of you know it from your experience, that the way… We can say we could have saved literally an awful lot of lives if people had listened. We turned wearing masks into a political statement. If you were for this thing, you wear it or for somebody else, you didn’t wear it. When in fact, it’s just plain basic science. It’s science. It’s social distancing, so you’re not coughing on one another, the particles. The ventilation you talked about Carmen, makes a difference in community centers and alike. And so there’s so many things that we can do that are just within our own power. We’re probably going to be sending out an awful lot of masks around the country very shortly, millions of them. But the point is that you all, interesting, without my asking you, talked about the need to social distance. It’s kind of hard to social distance in a fire truck. It’s kind of hard to social distance with an EMT in a back of a wagon. But you all know it’s important and so I hope you’ll… I had said when I got elected that my first 100 days, I guaranteed people we’d get at least 100 million shots in people’s arms. 100 million shots in people’s arms. 30 days in, we’re about 40% of the way there. Almost 50 million. Almost 50 million right now. And we said we were going to do 100 million shots a day. One of the things that you and Melanie know is that we had to get vaccinators. It’s one thing to get vaccine delivered, another thing to get it out of that vial into a needle and into somebody’s arm. And so we worked very hard. … department to others and to units within commercial operations that can have people do the vaccination. I signed an executive order allowing former, retired doctors and nurses to be able to come back and give vaccinations. And so, we’re going to beat this thing because of folks like you. And the extent you can continue to have your constituencies… And they’re all different. Is to make sure that they understand that social distancing matters, washing your hands matters, and the whole idea… And I don’t have to tell you that, Al. Yes, sir. They’re doing pretty good. We’re blessed. Well, thank God. But one of the things that… You know, again, I’m going to go back to the whole question of equity. What we’re trying to do, my team and I, is get people who in fact have been most hurt by this pandemic to places where they are comfortable. Where they have comfort in going, they don’t feel like they are… They’re not intimated by the circumstance. They’re used to going to their grocery store, they’re used to going to their drug store or pharmacy. They’re used to doing those things. But we also are trying to get out mobile units into communities. Not only inter-city but rural communities that don’t have as much access. They tell me the statistic is that the vast majority of the American people live within five miles of a pharmacy. Well, the point is that, that may be the case but if you’re an older person living by yourself, you don’t have a vehicle and there’s no public transportation it’s awful hard to get to that pharmacy. So we’re working out ways now to provide mobile transportation, literally vans going into communities and people getting shots that are being administered by people who people tend to trust. I can’t tell you how much difference you’re making. We’ve met with people all over the country via this means. And I think there’s a growing awareness that injection bleach into your system doesn’t do it for you. Deniers. Deniers. And telling all these stories that aren’t true. So, I really appreciate you and you’re colleague across the country who are continuing to push and say, “No, if you can get a vaccine, get. If you can get it, get it as quickly as you can. Socially distance. We’re now doing a study, the COVID team they’re studying whether or not once you’ve had the vaccine and you’ve had it for the better part of several weeks, the last shot, what can you do and not do in terms of being sure that you are safe. Do you still wear a mask? Do you still socially distance, etc.? We’re an administration that thinks science matters. Science matters. And it has to be available to the poorest among us and those who are most hurt by this COVID crisis, across the board. And that’s what we’re doing. Do you have any questions for me? Seriously, ask me anything you’d like. I can tell Carmen has a good question, I don’t know, she’s not sure, “Should I really ask him that?” You can ask me anything you want, I’m just Joe, okay? So, fire away. I’m going to be back in Columbus… I was in Columbus actually now it’s about literally 35 days or so ago. I came through on a whistle stop a train when I was trying to get the nomination, when I was trying to win the election. But I like Columbus. I’m a Democrat, but I think your Governor’s doing a pretty decent job at trying to get things going. I don’t think there’s anything political about this. Some folks are just stepping up, and he’s stepped up in my impression. We disagree on things, we used to serve together, I like him. But it’s not a… I just think this is about the science. I’ll tell you what, I hope I can get to the point where that’s happened. Now, the one thing I get most asked is when it’s going to go back to normal. The honest to God truth is, I can’t tell you that. But most experts tell you that things are going to continue to change and change somewhat rapidly. I think you’re going to see that next fall is going to be different than last fall. I think you’re going to see that we’re going to be going into the Christmas season better than we were. Whether it’s back to complete normal? I don’t know. But, we’re going to beat this. I promise you, we are going to, together, beat this. But the idea that over 500, I think it’s… I have a card. As of yesterday there are 500,071 people who have died from this. That’s more people that died in World War I, World War II and Vietnam combined. In a year. In a year. But look, when American people set their minds to something there’s nothing, nothing we’ve been unable to do if we do it together. So, with your help and there’s so darn many… Look at all the stuff that’s, I don’t know, bad or disappointing out there. But there’s so darn many good, decent, honorable people in this country and they want to get it done right. So. In the meantime, make me one promise. You all take care of yourselves. We need you, for real. We need you, for real. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you all. Thank you for your time and sharing your thoughts. It’s wonderful to be with you. Thank you, Mr. President. And you have the number. You can call us anytime. I really mean it. Not a joke. They know how to find me now, so. We have her email, I think. Believe me, she knows how to find me. “Joe, where are you? Come here. Mr. President. Not Joe. Well, we used to be Joe. Okay. Joe is still good. All right. All right. Thank you. Thanks everybody. Take Care. Stay well. Appreciate it. That’s it. Mr. We’re going to push. I still think there’s a shot. A good shot."
"30","02-24-21"," Good afternoon. The Vice-President and I had a very productive meeting with a bipartisan group of Senators and House members to address an issue of both concern to our economic security as well as our national security, the resilience and reliability of our critical supply chains. This is a critical area where Republicans and Democrats agreed it was one of the best meetings I think we’ve had so far, even though we’ve only been here about five weeks. It was like the old days, people actually were on the same page. There were good bipartisan work has already been done. The leaders of this operation, the House and Senate already have done great work. And I want to thank them for their leadership. We’re here to build on that, and the bottom line is simple. The American people should never fail face shortages in the goods and services they rely on, whether that’s their car or their prescription medicines or the food at the local grocery store. And remember, the shortages in PPE during the pandemic, that meant we didn’t have masks, we didn’t have gowns or gloves to protect our frontline healthcare workers. We heard horror stories of doctors and nurses wearing trash bags over their dress in order so they wouldn’t be in trouble because they had no gowns. And they were rewashing and reusing their mask over and over again in the OR. That should have never happened. And this will never happen again in the United States, period. We shouldn’t have to rely on a foreign country, especially one that doesn’t share our interests or our values, in order to protect and provide our people during a national emergency. That’s why one of the first executive orders I signed, as some may remember, was to ensure that we’re manufacturing more protective equipment for healthcare workers here at home. And today I’m shortly going to be signing another executive order that will help address the vulnerabilities in our supply chains across additional critical sectors of our economy. So the American people are prepared to withstand any crisis and rely on ourselves. This is about making sure the United States can meet every challenge we face in this new era, pandemics, but also in defense, cyber security, climate change, and so much more. And the best way to do that is by protecting and sharpening America’s competitive edge by investing here at home. As I’ve said from the beginning, while I was running, we’re going to invest in America, going to invest in American workers. And then we can maybe be in a much better position to even compete beyond what we’re doing now. Resilient, diverse, and secure supply chains are going to help revitalize our domestic manufacturing capacity and create good paying jobs, not $15 an hour, which we need to do someday, and soon as of better in my view, but jobs that are at the prevailing wage. We’re going to spur new opportunities for small businesses, communities of color and economically distressed areas. And I will drive new investment and research and innovation and our workforce, investing in training, university partnerships that are going to lead to new technologies and new solutions. All of this won’t just strengthen our domestic capacity, will help unleash new markets around the world and grow opportunities for American businesses to export their goods that we’re going to be making. These are the kinds of common sense solutions that all Americans can get behind, workers and corporate leaders, Republicans and Democrats. It’s about resilience, identify possible points of vulnerabilities in our supply chains and making sure we have the backup alternatives or workarounds in place. Remember that old proverb, for want of a nail, the shoe was lost. For want of a shoe, the horse was lost. And it goes on and on until the kingdom was lost. All for the want of a horseshoe nail. Even small failures at one point in the supply chain can cause outside impacts further up the chain. Recently, we’ve seen how a shortage of computer chips … Computer chips like the one I have here. You can hardly see it I imagine. It’s called a semiconductor … has caused delays in production of automobiles that has resulted in reduced hours for American workers. A 21st century horseshoe nail. This semiconductor is smaller than a postage stamp, but it has more than 8 billion transistors, 8 billion transistors, 10,000 times thinner than a single human hair in this one chip. These chips are a wonder of innovation and design and power so much of our country, enable so much of our modern lives [inaudible 00:05:00]. Not just our cars, but our smartphones, televisions radios, medical diagnostic equipment, and so much more. We need to make sure these supply chains are secure and reliable. I’m directing senior officials in my administration to work with industrial leaders to identify solutions to this semiconductor shortfall and work very hard with the House and Senate. They’ve authorized the bill, but they need [inaudible 00:05:26] $37 billion short-term to make sure we have this capacity. We’ll push for that as well. We all recognize that the particular problem won’t be solved immediately. In the meantime, we are reaching out to our allies, semiconductor companies and others in the supply chain, to ramp up production to help us resolve the bottlenecks we face now. We need to stop playing catch up after the supply chain crisis hit. We need to prevent the supply same crisis from hitting in the first place. And in some cases, building resilience will mean increasing our production of certain types of elements here at home. In others, it mean working more closely with our trusted friends and partners, nations that share our values so that our supply chains can’t be used against us as leverage. It will mean identifying and building surge capacity that can quickly be turned into and ramp up production in times of emergency. And it will mean investing in research and development, like we did in the 60s, to ensure longterm competitiveness in our manufacturing base in the decades ahead. The order I’m about to sign does two things. First, the order is a 100 day review of four vital products, semiconductors, one, key minerals and materials like rare earth that are used to make everything from harder steel to airplanes, three, pharmaceuticals and their ingredients, four, advanced batteries like the ones using electric vehicles. There’s strong bipartisan support after fast reviews of these four areas, because they’re essential to protecting and strengthening American competitiveness. Second, this order initiates a longterm review of the industry basis of six sectors of our overall economy over the next year. These reviews will identify policy recommendations to fortify our supply chains at every step, and critically to start implementing those recommendations right away. We’re not going to wait for you to be completed before you start closing the existing gaps. And as we implement this work, my administration will draw on a full range of American talent, including labor and industry leaders, policy experts, scientists, farmers, engineers, to get their input. I’m grateful for the members of Congress who came to see me, Republican leaders as well as Democrats. They’re leading the way. We’re going to stay in close contact with members of both sides of the aisle and keep advancing our shared goals. Everyone has a role to play to strengthen our supply chains and our country. This is the United States of America. We are better prepared to meet the challenges of the 21st century than any country in the world. There’s nothing, nothing, nothing we will fail to achieve if we work together, and that’s what we decided to do today. And that’s what we’re going to do, work together. So I thank you all. I’m very optimistic about the meeting we had today with our congressional colleagues. And now I’m going to walk over and sign that executive order. Thank you all very much. Mr. I am, but I don’t so much blame it on the Senate. I blame it on the failure to have a transition that was rational. As you know, previous administrations had a significant number of their cabinet confirmed before they were sworn in. That’s the tradition. But we’re doing fine. I think we’re going to be in good shape. [crosstalk 00:09:54] Thank you. [crosstalk 00:09:56]. Yes, I have. Thank you. Thank you."
"31","02-25-21"," Well, thank you all. Dr. Fauci, thanks for your leadership. Thanks for being here. Two weeks ago I spent some time with you and Dr. Francis Collins, excuse me, the Director of National Institute of Health, NIH. And he gave me a tour of the vaccine research center in Bethesda, Maryland. And it’s the place where our top scientists spend years researching and developing vaccines and treatments for all kinds of viruses. The brilliant team there made possible the rapid deployment and development of COVID-19 vaccines, and they’re truly remarkable. And this administration will follow the science to deliver more breakthroughs. We are doing that to beat COVID-19 and other diseases like cancer, which is something that’s so personal in so many families including me and Kamala’s and many of yours. We’ve asked Dr. Eric Lander, renowned Harvard, MIT scientist, to serve as my science advisor and Head of the Office of Science and Technology Policy and co lead the Presidential Council on Advisory Science and Technology. These are the White House offices that bring together the country’s top scientists to address our most pressing needs. And they’ll be part of the work to develop a DARPA like advanced research effort on cancer and other diseases, just like we do DARPA in the Defense Department which develops breakthrough projects to secure our national security. And relatedly, I’m delighted to see five of the nation’s leading cancer centers are joining forces today to build on the work of the Cancer Moonshot I was able to do during the Obama, Biden administration to help break through silos and barriers in cancer research. We’re making progress. There’s so much we can do, so much progress within our reach and that’s why I’m thankful the folks here today for getting their vaccine shots. Gerald Bon and Corey Hamilton are both DC firefighters. I said to Corey that old expression, God made man, then he made a few firefighters. Thank God we have them. And Linda Bussey is a manager of a Safeway grocery store in Bethesda. Victoria Ledgerwood Rivera, who is a local school counselor. And Elizabeth Calloway, who is a registered nurse who administered these shots. And the more people get vaccinated, the faster we’re going to beat this pandemic. That’s why one of my first goals in office just before I was sworn in, I indicated that my goal was to get 100 million COVID vaccine shots in people’s arms in my first 100 days as president. At first critics said that goal was too ambitious, no one could do that. Then they said it was too small. At the bottom line though is that America will be the first country, perhaps the only one to get that done. And today I’m here to report we’re halfway there. 15 million shots in just 37 days since I’ve become president. That’s weeks ahead of schedule. Even with the setbacks we faced during the recent winter storms which devastated millions of Midwestern cities, towns, and also the same in the South. We’re moving in the right direction though despite the mess we inherited from the previous administration which left us with no real plan to vaccinate all Americans. And every time we administer another 50 million shots, I’m going to use that milestone and report to the American people on our vaccination program, on our overall fight against this pandemic. The good and the bad, I’ll tell you. The success and the failures. And here’s the deal, here’s the deal. The story of this vaccination campaign is like the story of everything hard and new America does. Some confusion and setbacks at the start and then if we do the right things, we have the right plan to get things moving. That’s what we’re seeing right now. The weeks before I became president, the previous administration saw 6 million shots administered in the last week. This coming week, we will administer over 12 million shots, double the pace, in just six weeks that we’ve been in office. Other milestones. We’ve increased vaccination distribution to states by 70%. Nearly 60% of people over the age of 75 have now received at least one shot. It was 14% six weeks ago. And close to 50% of people over the age of 65 have at least one shot now. It was 8%, six weeks ago. It’s important because people over 65 account for 80% of all the COVID deaths. Additionally, about 75% of the people who live in long-term facilities have gotten their first shot. And those cases are at the lowest level since reporting began in May. Here’s how we’ve been doing it. It starts with increasing the supply. My team has worked very hard with vaccine manufacturers, Pfizer and Moderna, it to ensure we have enough supply for all adult Americans by the end of July. When we discovered the vaccine manufacturers weren’t being prioritized when it came to securing supplies they needed to make the vaccine, we fixed the problem. I used the Defense Production Act to speed up the supply chain for key equipment, which has already helped increase vaccine production. Last week, I toured the Pfizer facility, manufacturing facility, a plant in Kalamazoo, Michigan. It’s incredible, the precision, the safety, the pride, and the sense of purpose everyone involved in that process and project has. We’ve all seen the news about Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine. The idea of a third safe and effective vaccine is very promising. The Food and Drug Administration, the FDA, is reviewing the data and review recommendations from outside committee of experts that will be meeting tomorrow. Let me be clear, we are going to do this the right way. The FDA will decide on emergency use authorization of a vaccine based on science, not due to any political pressure from me or anyone else. No outside factors. What I will say to the American people is this. If, if the FDA approves the use of this new vaccine, we have a plan to roll it out as quickly as Johnson & Johnson can make it. We’ll use every conceivable way to expand manufacturing of the vaccine and we’ll make even more rapid progress on overall vaccines in March. I’ll have more to say about this in the days after the FDA review. Look, we’ve been laser focused on the greatest operational challenge this country has ever undertaken, administering shots in the arms of hundreds of millions of Americans. We’re increasing the number of vaccinators. What we found was you may have the vaccine, but not enough people to put the vaccine in someone’s arm like you just saw. We brought back retired, doctors and nurses. We’ve already deployed more than 1,500 medical personnel you see during national disasters from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA. And we commissioned our commission corps from the Department of Health and Human Services and the Defense Department, including the National Guard, supplying vaccinators. We’re lining up thousands more to do the vaccinations. We’re also setting up more places for people to get vaccines. As of today, we provided $3.8 billion to states, territories, and tribes to create hundreds of new vaccination centers and ramp up the existing ones that there are already. Working with governors across the country in red and blue states to bolster their efforts to stand up hundreds of vaccination centers from stadiums to community centers, houses of worship, large parking lots, we’re providing personnel and equipment and covering the cost for the states including for the use of their National Guard, which had been there incredible. Today, Jill and I, or should I should say tomorrow, Jill and I will travel to Houston, Texas to tour one of the first federal mass vaccination centers and to thank everyone involved. This is an example of the kind of partnership between federal, state and local governments and public and private partners that’s going to get this job done. We also sent millions of vaccines to thousands of local pharmacies all across America to make it easier for folks to get the vaccine shot like they would their flu shot. Going to a familiar place, familiar folks that they can trust and know to get the shot. And for folks who don’t live near a vaccination center or a pharmacy, we’re deploying mobile units. These are special vehicles and pop-up clinics that meet folks where they live and where they don’t have transportation to get to the places to get the shots. We’ve also started to send vaccines directly to community health centers to help the hard to reach folks in cities and small towns of rural communities and black, Latino, and native American communities that have higher rates of COVID infections and deaths than any other groups. As a result of these round the clock efforts, in five weeks, America’s administered the most shots of any country in the world, any country in the world, with among the highest percentage of population fully vaccinated. That’s progress we promised. And it’s also true that while COVID-19 vaccinations are up, COVID cases and hospitalizations are coming down. But I need to be honest with you, cases and hospitalizations could go back up with new variants as they emerge. So I want to make something really very clear. This is not a time to relax. We must keep washing our hands, stay socially distanced, and for God’s sake, for God’s sake, wear a mask. Some of our progress in this fight is because so many Americans are stepping up and doing those things. And the worst thing we could do now is let our guard down. Of course, it’s my hope to come back in the next report after we’ve done another 50 million shots before the end of my first 100 days. But here’s the critical point, as hard as it is now to believe, we’re going to hit a phase in this effort, maybe as late as April or May, where many predict that instead of long lines of people waiting to get a shot, we’ll face a very different scenario. We’ll have the vaccine waiting, we’ll have ramped up vaccine supplies. We’ll have folks to administer the shots to the most of the people who aren’t eager to get the shots. At least that’s been the prediction. I don’t think it’s going to happen. I think more people see other people getting the shots, it’s going to build confidence. But at the same time, there are people who live in hard to reach areas who can’t get them. And there are folks who are hesitant to take the shot in the first place. We all know there’s a history in this country of subjecting certain communities to terrible medical and scientific abuse. But if there is one message that needs to cut through, it’s this. The vaccines are safe and effective. And I believe as you see your neighbor, your husband, your wife, your son, your daughter, getting it, that you will be much more inclined to get it. Listen to Dr. Fauci, listen to the scientists to developed these vaccines and the extensive and rigorous review they went through. I did. I took my shots publicly to demonstrate to the American people that it’s safe and effective. But the time is coming, maybe 60 to 90 days, when the supply is adequate but not enough people can access the shots or don’t want them. To address that challenge, we’re going to launch a massive campaign to educate people about vaccines, that they are safe and effective, and where to go to get those shots in the first place. And we’re going to bring together leaders of all segments of our society to educate and encourage all Americans to get vaccinated. So I hope the Senate will soon confirm a key leader of that effort. My nominee for the Secretary of Health and Human Service, Xavier Becerra, who did so well in his hearing of this week. I hope Congress passes the American Rescue Plan which I’ve been pushing, which provides funds for everything we need to do to beat this pandemic and get the economy going again. Now, critics say the plan is too big, that it cost too much. But let me ask a rhetorical question, what would you have me cut? What would you have me cut out on vaccines alone if we don’t invest $20 billion to vaccinate the nation, doesn’t that make sense? Or 160 billion in total towards the pandemic for testing, to protective gear, to vaccine production and distribution. I’m ready to hear any ideas on what will make the American Rescue Plan better, stronger, and effective? But we’ll have to answer who will get help and who will get hurt. I want to close with this, the question I’m asked most often is, when will things get back to normal? My answer is always honest and straight forward. I can’t give you a date. I can only promise that we’ll work as hard as we can to make that day come as soon as possible. While things are improving are we’re going from a mess we inherited to moving in the right direction at a significant speed, this is not a victory lap. Everything is not fixed. We have a long way to go. And at that day when everything is back to normal, depends on all of us. It depends on Congress passing the American Recovery Plan. And also for us to remain vigilant, to look out for one another. I’ve said it before, wash your hands, stay socially distanced, wear a mask, get the vaccine when it’s your turn. When your friend or neighbor or loved one is eligible, encourage them to get vaccinated. And above all, remember, we can do this. This is the United States of America. There’s nothing we can’t do when we do it together. So it’s not over yet, but we’re getting close. And God willing, if we do all we know we have to do, we’re going to beat this. Beat it sooner than later. May God bless you all and may God protect our troops. Thank you for your time."
"32","02-27-21"," Y’all been very polite. You’re with me all day and it’s dinner time. Good afternoon, or almost, actually it’s evening. And I want to thank you, Governor Ms. Abbott for your hospitality and your friendship and representing Senator Cornyn I think he had to go back, I think he was getting on a plane and he came in to see me last event and representatives Shirley Jackson Lee, Al Green, Sylvia Garcia, Lizzie Panelli, excuse me, Pannill. What am I doing here? I’m going to lose track here and Mayor Turner, Judge Hidalgo. Thank you all for welcoming us. And Jill and I wanted to visit Texas today for a couple of reasons. First and foremost, let the people in Texas know our prayers are with you in the aftermath of this winter storm. And secondly, to let you know what I told Governor Abbott and Mayor Turner and Judge Hidalgo and the congressional delegation, that we will be true partners to help you recover and rebuild from the storms and this pandemic and the economic crisis. We’re in from the long haul. Early today, we received an update on the storm relief efforts from Harris County and the Harris County Emergency Operations Center. Folks they’re doing God’s work as my mother would say. It was an important update on how the federal government and the states are working together through the major disaster declaration and emergency declarations that I made after the storm hit when the governor contacted me. The Federal Emergency Management, FEMA, is providing millions of gallons of water and millions of meals and direct assistance to uninsured homeowners to repair the damage burst pipes caused to millions of homes across the state. The public assistance that comes with disaster declaration ensures that mayors and county officials can find shelter for folks in need and keep them safe and warm. This is an addition to the more than 125,000 blankets FEMA has also made available to storm victims so children and families don’t go to sleep cold. FEMA working with the Defense Logistics Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers from the defense department has made generators and diesel fuel available to hospitals and nursing homes and other critical facilities to keep the lights on and speed power restoration along the way. Many local military bases are helping efforts to distribute water and food, fuel and blankets all across this state. And I especially want to thank the service members for helping your fellow Americans in time of need. When we have a problem, we always call on the military, domestic or foreign, no matter what. The best in the world. And I know millions of Texans have been impacted by the disruption of community water systems as a result of the power outages. The environmental protection agency has deployed mobile drinking water labs in Houston, San Antonio, and Fort Worth to test water so you get boil water advisories lifted and get safe drinking water flowing through those faucets again. There’s more, but let me say this. We’re not here today as Democrats or Republicans, we’re here today as Americans. The American leaders with responsibility, all of us here in this parking lot, responsibility to all the people we serve when a crisis hits our states, like the one that hit Texas, it’s not a Republican or Democrat who’s hurting, it’s our fellow Americans are hurting and it’s our job to help everyone in need. Look out for one another, leave nobody behind. That’s what we’ve seen today in our visit. After our briefing on the storm relief, we stopped by the Houston Food Bank, that’s also doing God’s work, incredible operation, just like everyone else here in the vaccination center, they’ve done thousands of people, thousands of people. Making a fundamental difference in the safety and security of people. The more people get vaccinated, the faster we’ll beat this pandemic. That’s why one of my first steps and my first goals as president was to announce that I was going to get 100 million COVID vaccine shots administered in my first 100 days. Because of the people behind me and others, America is going to be the first in the country, perhaps the first in the world to get that done. I’m proud to say we’re halfway there, 50 million shots. Actually, I was telling my congressmen, I carry a little card with me and a list every day the actual number of vaccines that have been a minister. As of last night, 503,587, every single one matters, in just 37 days. We’re weeks ahead of schedule. Even with setbacks from the winter storm we’re moving in the right direction. Look in the last six weeks, we’ve gone from 6 million shots right before we took office in total to 12 million shots per week now. We’ve increased vaccine distribution by 70%. 60% of the people over the age of 75 have received at least one, shot close to 50% of the people over the age of 65, got at least one shot. And you say, why am I focusing on that? Well, it’s especially important because people over the age of 65 account for 80% of all the COVID deaths, 80%. roughly 75% of the people who live in long-term care facilities now have gotten their first dose and those cases are at the lowest level since the reporting began back in May. We’re making this progress because of all of you, the federal government and the states are working together along with public and private partners. It starts with supply. We work with vaccine manufacturers Pfizer and Moderna to ensure we had enough supply to supply all adults in America by the end of July. And we discovered the vaccine manufacturers though, weren’t getting prioritized when it came to securing supplies they needed to fix their problem and not being able to go more rapidly. So I used the Defense Production Act to speed up the supply chain for key equipment that’s already helped increase vaccine production. Last week, I toured the Pfizer vaccine manufacturing facility in Kalamazoo, Michigan. It’s incredible. The precision, the safety, the pride, the sense of purpose, everyone involved that facility. And we’ve all seen the news about Johnson & Johnson vaccine today, just the third safe, effective vaccine and they’ve approved it today. We’re going to use every conceivable way to expand manufacturing of the vaccine, the third vaccine, to make even more rapid progress in getting shots in people’s arms. Here’s what else we’re doing. We’re increasing the number of vaccinators, it’s one thing to have the vaccine, another thing to get into people’s arms. We brought back retired doctors and nurses, my executive order allow that to happen. We’ve already deployed more than 1,500 medical professionals. You see during the natural disasters from the FEMA, our commissioned corps from the department of health and human services and the defense department, including the national guard. And we’re lining up thousands more. We’re also setting up more places to get vaccinated. And as of today, we provided $3.8 billion to states, territories, and tribes to create hundreds of new vaccination centers and ramp up existing ones. We’re providing personnel and equipment, and we’re covering the cost for states including the use of their national guards. Here in Texas, it’s meant millions of dollars and hundreds of vaccinators working in community vaccination centers and three mass vaccination centers in Arlington, Dallas, and right here in Houston in the other side here. They vaccinate thousands of Texans a day, tens of thousands overall, I want to show the American people, the extraordinary effort being made and undertaken and the most difficult operational challenge this nation has ever faced logistically. It’s remarkable. About six thousand doses a day here. Folks who are eligible can call by phone, sign up online for an appointment, drive in, stay in their cars get a shot, in and out in a very short amount of time. Requires massive logistical coordination and critical federal support from FEMA and the national guard to work with cities and states and the Houston Texans stand up this kind of site. Vice President Harris and I did a virtual tour of a similar vaccination center in Arizona. One nurse there, she talked about the shots, talking how many they were getting in people’s arms. And she said, she felt like she was administrating, and get this, a dose of hope. A dose of hope. We’re working with governors across the country to stand up and lend federal support to hundreds of vaccination centers from stadiums like here to community centers, to houses of worship, large parking lots, delivery places, doses of hope we can get in people’s arms as quickly as possible. I’ve also sent millions of vaccines to thousands of local pharmacies, over 7,000, to make it easier for folks to get the COVID-19 vaccine shot like they would a flu shot because people are comfortable going to their local pharmacy. They’d go there for their flu shot, everything else, they trust the pharmacist and they’re likely to go. Here in Texas, that includes 500 pharmacies across this state like Walmart and CVS, including 50 pharmacies here in Houston. And for the folks who didn’t live near a vaccination center or a pharmacy, we’re deploying mobile clinics to go out to those neighborhoods in rural areas where people are unable to get to the centers. These are special vehicles with pop up clinics and meet folks where they live and where they don’t have the transportation to get the shots, which there’ll be launching very soon here in Houston, those mobile units, as well as Dallas Arlington and across the state. We’ve also started to send vaccines directly to community health centers, to help the hard to reach folks in cities, small towns, rural communities, in black, Latino, and native American communities that have higher rates of COVID-19 infections and deaths than any other groups. Here in Texas, we’re already partnered with 12 community health centers in 10 cities, which have combined sites at over 100 locations across the entire state. We’re going to save people’s lives as a result of these round the clock efforts. In five weeks America’s administered the most shots of any country in the world, that’s great progress. It’s also true that while COVID-19 vaccinations are up, COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations are down, but I need to be honest with you. I said from the beginning like Roosevelt who said, I’ll shoot you straight from the shoulder. You can handle anything as long as you’re told the truth. Cases and hospitalizations could go back up as new variants emerge and it’s not the time to relax. We have to keep washing our hands, staying socially distance and for God’s sake wear your mask. Wear your mask. It’s not a political statement, it’s a patriotic thing to do. Some of our progress in this fight is because so many Americans are stepping up and doing these things. And the worst thing we could do now would be let our guard down. And here’s another critical point. We’re going to hit a phase in this effort, maybe late April early May, when many predict there’ll be ramped up vaccine supply and we’ll have administered shots to most of the people really are eager to get them and those who have been able to get there. But at the same time, the warning is there’ll be people who live in hard to reach areas who can’t get the shots and there are folks who are hesitant to take the shots. We all know there’s a history of this country of subjugating certain communities to terrible medical and scientific abuse. But if there’s one message the needs to cut through all this, the vaccines are safe, I promise you they are safe and effective. Listen to Dr. Fauci, listen to the scientists who develop them through extensive and rigorous review. I did and I took my shot publicly to demonstrate to the American people it’s safe and effective. To address this challenge we’re going to launch a massive campaign to educate people about the vaccines, that they are safe and effective and that they can go and get those shots and be good. I’m going to close with this. This past year has been one of the most painful years in American history. As I said, we’ve lost over 500,000 lives of the virus. 500,000 moms and dads, husbands and wives, sons and daughters, staring at an empty chair at the dining room table or the kitchen table, friends, neighbors, coworkers, all over the country where the loved ones who are gone, they’re gone. Empty, empty feeling your chest, like you’re being sucked into a black hole in your chest. But all over the country where loved ones once sat there’s an empty chair. And folks, look, there’s so much we can do. As you see the broken hearts and the families that have been left behind. There’s nothing partisan about this virus. It’s too long we’ve allowed the virus to divide us. I met today with Governor Abbott, Senator Cornyn, conservative Republicans, I’m a democratic president, we disagree on plenty of things and nothing wrong with that. But there are plenty of things we can work on together and one of them is represented right here today, the effort to speed up vaccinations. We’re not giving shots to Democrats or Republicans, I say it again, we’re giving shots to Americans. And all across the country we’ve got members of the armed forces, FEMA, volunteers, retirees, fellow Americans working around the clock to give these shots. And they’re building on the work of scientists, researchers, doctors, and nurses. And my team at the White House which is coordinating all of this is first rate. None of this has a partisan tinge or a partisan element to it. This can be a great American achievement, being the only country in the world to reach a hundred million shots in a hundred days. This could unite us as a country. To vaccinate America, to protect America, to heal America. And I know we can do this. Why? Because I know America can do great things when we do it together. I know my family spent a lot of time here in Houston, by the way at… Hey John Eddie, how are you buddy? I didn’t see you there. At Houston at MD Anderson, when our son Beau was being treated for glioblastoma before he passed away. Just yesterday, I saw MD Anderson announced they joined four other major cancer hospitals to help break down the silos that make real progress in this effort difficult. Now they’re sharing data and information, that wasn’t going on four or five years ago. We’re going to beat cancer, I know we will. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, there’s just one thing, one thing, I could be known for as president, it would be the president who during his era ended cancer as we know it. But then last week, guess what? We also landed a rover on Mars, led by a NASA team in Pasadena, California. A rover carries instruments developed by our team here in Houston, that’ll be used in the mission of our time and our dreams. Imagine. Everybody’s been so down the last number of years, about what America, what can we do? We can do anything. American can do anything. And now we see the images that are truly stunning, battling COVID, beating cancer, going to Mars. If there’s one thing I know about America is this, Americans never give up, they never give in, they never cry uncle. They just struggle, innovate, and they preserve and persevere. We’re going to get through all of this. I promise you, we’re going to do it together. Together. God bless you all and may God protect our troops. You’re the best. We can do all this guys, I promise you. We can do this. Nobody in the world can compete with us when we’re together. Thank you also very much."
"33","02-29-20"," Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. South Carolina. My buddy Jim Clyburn you brought me back. It’s a man of enormous integrity. For all those of you who’ve been knocked down. Counted out. Left behind. This is your campaign. Just days ago, the press and the pundits declared this candidacy dead. Now, thanks to all of you, the heart of the Democratic Party, we just won, and we’ve won big because of you. And we are very much alive. I told y’all that you can launch a candidacy. You launched Bill Clinton, Barack Obama to the Presidency. Now you launched our campaign on the path to defeating Donald Trump. This campaign has taken off. So join us, go to joebiden.com sign up, volunteer, contribute if you can, but we need you. We want you. And there’s a place for you in this campaign. Folks, as we celebrate tonight, here in Columbia, let me talk directly to Democrats across America especially those who will be voting on Super Tuesday. This is the moment to choose the path forward for our party. This is the moment and it’s arrived. Maybe sooner than anyone guessed it would, but it’s here and the decisions Democrats make all across America the next few days will determine what this party stands for, what we believe and what will get done. If Democrats nominate me I believe we can beat Donald Trump. Keep Nancy Pelosi in the House of Representatives as Speaker, and take back the United States Senate. So join us. My fellow Democrats across America, join us. If Democrats want to nominate someone who will build on Obamacare, not scrap it. Take on the NRA and gun manufacturers not protect them. Stand up and give the poor a fighting chance and the middle class get restored. Not raise their taxes and keep the promises we make, then join us. And if the Democrats want a nominee who’s a Democrat. A life long Democrat. A proud Democrat. An Obama-Biden Democrat. Then join us. We have the option of winning big or losing big. That’s the choice. We need to build on the coalition and legacy of the most successful President in our lifetime, Barack Obama. And the way we do this is by bringing Americans together of every race, ethnicity, gender, economic station, Democrats, Republicans, Independents, people of every stripe. Look just like we did here in South Carolina. And like we can do across the entire country on Tuesday and beyond. Folks win big or lose. That’s the choice. Most Americans don’t want the promise of revolution. They want more than promises, they want results. They want to give all Americans access to real opportunity. To be able to have affordable healthcare for all Americans. An environment with clean air and clean water and education, and funds our schools. Pays our teachers. Makes community college free. A nation that will stand up to and beat the NRA. Reform our criminal justice system, root out institutional [inaudible 00:06:05], mobilize, mobilize the world against climate change. And an economy that works. Rewards work, not just wealth. My dad used to say, Joe, your job’s about a lot more than the paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about decency, respect. It’s about your place in the community. It’s being able to look your kid in the eye and say, honey, it’s going to be okay. For all our families, for all our communities, because that’s the right thing to do. That’s what makes us Democrats. Talk is cheap. False promises are deceptive, and talk about revolution ain’t changing anyone’s life. We need real changes, right now. Something I’ve done my whole career, and I’ll do as President. Well, this isn’t an election to spend all our time in a battle for the soul of the Democratic Party. This is a battle for the soul of the United States of America. I won an incredibly perilous moment as all of you know. Winning means uniting America not sewing more division and anger. It means not only fighting but healing the country. We have to beat Donald Trump and the Republican Party, but here’s the deal. We can’t become like them. We can’t become like them. We can’t have a never-ending war. Above all, it’s time for America to get back up. The country is so ready, so ready. Once again, fight for the proposition that we hold these truths to be self-evident. That all men and women are created equal, endowed by the creator with certain inalienable rights. We say it all the time, but we’ve never fully lived up to it. But we’ve never before until this president walked away from it. And it’s the reason why Jim and I and all of us are in this, I believe with every fiber of my being, that all men and women are created equal. You know, I saw it a few days ago in a town hall in Charleston, Jim. I spoke with Reverend Anthony Thompson, whose wife Myra was studying the words of her Bible with eight other parishioners in Mother Emanuel, four and a half years ago. It was a weekly routine reading scripture and finding purpose and faith in God and each other. And in an instant hate, vengeance, white supremacy pierced that faith, and they were lost forever. But you know what I found the most remarkable thing in my career thus far. Remark about Reverend Thompson and the families of the Emanuel Nine. It’s through all that pain, all that grief, they forgave. And here’s the deal. In their forgiveness. They brought more change to South Carolina than any that’s occurred over the previous 100 years. The Confederate flag came down. We’ll change. That’s why the Sunday after Jill and I and my family, we came back to mother Emanuel on Sunday services after the funeral of the victims because six weeks earlier, we had lost our son Bo, and we needed to be healed too. We need to be healed. I really mean this. We needed whatever they were exuding. And with every season that’s past, they’ve gotten up and found purpose to live life worthy of the ones they lost. Worthy of the blessings to live in this remarkable country. We left here, arrived in overwhelming pain thinking we can do this, we can get through this. So I want to tell you, it’s no small reason why I’m in this race. People like all of you here tonight, all around the country, the days of Donald Trump’s divisiveness will soon be over. And as Jim, according to Tocqueville. He was right. This multi-ethnic country we call our democracy America it can’t survive unless we focus on our goodness. We can build a more perfect union because the American people in the last three and a half years have seen the alternative. No, I really mean, think about it. They’ve seen how utterly mean selfish, lack of any sense of empathy or concern for anybody else. A President who not only has horrible policies but the way he mocks and makes fun of other people. All of you here in South Carolina, and especially Jim Clyburn my friend, who lifted me in this campaign on his shoulders. And I mean all of you. Many I don’t have time to name all of you. We, Jill and I, our daughter Ashley, my son Hunter has been on the phone straight through for me. My brothers, my sister, my two brothers, my sister, my five grandchildren, my four granddaughters who’ve come out on the campaign trail will never forget what you’ve done for us. Who can say without fear of contradiction, the Bidens love you guys man. The Bidens love you. That’s real. And folks now we need to stand behind Jaime Harrison. The next president of the… Next senator of South Carolina. We need to send Joe Cunningham, back to the House of Representatives. All of us. All the Biden’s thank you. Thank you for everything. Everything you’ve done for us. So folks so here’s the deal, let’s get back up. We’re decent, we’re brave, we’re resilient people. We can believe again. We’re better than this [inaudible 00:13:06], we’re better than this present. So get up, take back our country. This is the United States of America. There’s nothing beyond our capacity if we do it together. God bless you all, and may God protect you too. Thank you, thank you, thank you."
"34","03-02-20"," Well, thank you, thank you, thank you. Let me start off by thanking Sheila Jackson Lee for the passport into town. Thank you very, very much.

I had such a great time meeting with some of you outstanding students back in September. I warned you I was coming back and I’m back. I’m back. One of the finest America’s historic black universities and colleges. Now, I got to tell you, I’m from Delaware. Delaware State University. I have to tell you, I always tell the truth, you’re the second best. Delaware State University’s the best [inaudible 00:01:17]. Because they’re the ones that always [inaudible 00:01:23] brought me to the dance, reverend. They’re the ones. That’s where I got started. That’s where I got … Look, I’m very proud to support our HBCUs and minority serving institutions. Now as president, everybody kind of forgets now because you become so significant. Everybody kind of forgets why HBCUs came along in the first place because you weren’t allowed to go to any … Endowments other universities had. So I promise you as president of United States of America, I’m going to fund HBCUs by $70 billion over the next 10 years. Swear to God. Because you lack the endowments, you’re not able to compete for some of the significant multimillion dollar and several case billion dollar contracts the federal government puts out that in fact affects everything from geo positioning to lightweight metals and a whole range of things. And this will put you in a position to be able to compete because one thing you know, everybody now knows you can do anything anybody else in the nation can do and you can do it as well or better. You just have to have the wherewithal to compete. So folks, as I said, I want to thank Sheila Jackson Lee again. One thing you learn when you go to the United States Senate, as I did, I got there a little, I’m about 800 years older than Sheila Jackson Lee. But when you there a little bit earlier, she came and I’ll tell you what, she not only took the place by storm, she filled up a vacuum. And I learned a long time ago. Don’t argue with her. Just say yes. Just say yes. Yes, yes, yes. You are something else. I love you. Thank you. She not only fights for Texas, but she fights for, I mean this sincerely, everything that’s right. She doesn’t back down. She knows why she’s in it. When I got elected United States Senator as a 29-year-old kid, I wasn’t old enough to be sworn in. And after I won in a year when the Democratic candidates for president only won 33% of the vote and I won by a rousing 3,000 votes statewide, everybody had come to me, new candidates run and they say, what’s your secret? Because if I won, there had to be some special secret. And I say, I tell you what the secret is. Have you figured out what’s worth losing over? Sheila Jackson Lee has never wondered about what’s worth losing over. She knows why she got involved. Just like Sylvia Garcia is not the only … She’s not only a history maker, she’s the first Latina to represent Houston in Congress. And she knows why she’s involved. She’s been one the side of working families here in Houston, is standing up for the vulnerable from her very first day as a legal aid lawyer. I understand that. I used to be a public defender when I was a kid when I got out of school. Houston is in good hands with such leadership and visionary leaders as you have fighting for you and the combination of the one who’s been there and has great power in the Congress. The one who’s a massive power for the same reason, they know why they’re involved. They know why they’re involved. Just a few days ago, the pundits just declared my campaign dead. But then along came South Carolina and South Carolina had something to say about it. As I stand here today, because of the minority communities, I am very much alive because of you. We not only won in South Carolina, we won every single solitary election district. And because the African American community primarily in South Carolina, we ended up increasing the turnout 150,000 more people than even voted in 2008 when Barack came out. Now, tomorrow, Texas is going to speak. We love Joe. Well thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And I think we’re going to do well here in Texas with the help of all of you. And when we do, we’ll be on our way to defeating Donald Trump. I want you to know I’m here heart and soul with everything I got to earn each and every vote here. I take nothing for granted. Nothing at all. But I’m asking you, I’m asking you for your vote. I’m asking you for your support because I’ve got to earn it. My message to everyone who’s been knocked down, counted out, left behind, this is your campaign. We need you. We want you and there’s a place for you in our campaign. So join us. Go to joebiden.com, sign up, volunteer, contribute if you can, but we need you very badly. Every vote matters tomorrow. Most important vote to make sure there’s not going to be any problem is that you send back Sheila Jackson Lee as the nominee without any question. Look, tomorrow is Super Tuesday and I want to thank you all. I’ll tell you what I’m rushing ahead, aren’t I? I want to speak directly to the Democrats here in Texas and all across the country. The moment to choose a path forward has arrived for our party maybe sooner than what people might’ve anticipated, maybe sooner than people guessed would occur or wanted to occur. But it’s here and the decision Democrats make tomorrow and the next few weeks, we’re going to determine what we stand for, what we believe and where we’re going to go and how we’ll get there. If Democrats want a nominee to beat Donald Trump, keep a majority in the House of Representatives and elect a US Senate and the State Legislature here in Texas and around the country, then join us. If Democrats want a nominee who will build on Obamacare, not scrap it, then join us. By the way, I was asked a question today on one of the national news programs, people are now worried about the coronavirus. I’m happy to talk about that later, but here’s the deal. They gave me an example that in fact one man got tested, went in to get tested because he was doing the right thing because he had a cold and he had been in another country and then he got a bill for $3,000. Under Obamacare, which they’re trying to wipe out, all tests are free. Free. Free. Free. All vaccines will be free to deal with these crises. And if you want someone who’s going to take on the NRA and the gun manufacturers, I’m your guy. You want someone who’s going to stand up for the middle class and the working poor. Look, we’re going to be the ones to do it because here’s the deal, we’re not going to raise taxes on anybody in terms of working folks. And I make this promise and I can keep it that we are going to provide all that is needed and we’re not going to have to do what others are proposing to get things done, have to raise significant taxes on middle class folks and working class folks. If the Democrats want a nominee who’s a Democrat, a lifelong Democrat, a proud Democrat, an Obama-Biden Democrat. Look, we can win big or lose big. That’s the choice that’s upon us now. We need to build on a coalition and a legacy of the most successful president in any of our lifetimes, Barack Obama. And we’ll do this by bringing Americans together, regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, disability, or economic station, Democrats, Republicans, independents of every stripe. Look, we did it. We won in South Carolina, like God willing, we’ll win in Texas tomorrow. And like we do all across America because the country is hungry, hungry, hungry to be United. Look, win big or lose big, that’s the choice. Most Americans don’t want a promise of a revolution. They want a guarantee of results on the things that affect them. They want to get access to real opportunity. Affordable, available healthcare for everyone, an environment with clean air, clean water and educational system that funds schools, pays for our teachers, makes community college free, deals for the overwhelming debt. The average person graduating from an HBCU this year will graduate $29,000 in debt. We can deal with that. I’m going to speak to that in a second. We’re a nation where we have to stand up to beat the NRA, reform our criminal justice system like you’ve been working on a long time, mobilize the world against climate change. A nation where we live by the values that embraces immigrants, refugees, asylum seekers, does not slam the door on those fleeing persecution, violence, and oppression, does not make people seeking asylum have to stay in another country to do it. We’ve never ever done, get children out of cages. Reunites families. I mean it. A nation that provides a pathway to citizen for 11 million people who are enriching our communities every day. We are better for it, not worse off for it. Look, we need an economy that rewards work, not just wealth like it is today. My dad used to have an expression. Joe, a job’s about a lot more than a paycheck. A job’s about your dignity, respect, your place in the community. And I really mean this. After he lost his job in Scranton and died in Scranton, coal died and everything died, took him three years to get to the point we were able to move to Delaware and get a three bedroom house with four kids and a grand pop lived with us. My Lord, I wonder how my parents dealt with those tin walls looking back on it, but anyway. But look, it’s about all our families. It’s about all our communities. The way I look at everything, and I mean this, I’m criticized for it occasionally. I look at everything through the prism of how it affects you, but your family and the community, all our communities. That’s why I’m a Democrat. That’s what got me involved in the first place. Folks, talk is cheap. False promises are deceptive and talk and revolution isn’t changing anyone’s life. We need real results and we need them now. I’ve done that in my whole career and I’ll do it as president. So this isn’t an election. This isn’t an election to spend all our time in the battle for the soul of the Democratic Party. We’re in the battle for the soul of this country and we really are. That’s what got me involved in this election in the first place. From the time I was a kid I got involved in the Civil Rights Movement. Coming home and by the way, my state, most of you don’t know, my state is the eighth largest black population in America. We have an awful lot in common. We to our great shame were a slave state. We are just like a lot of states in the South except we were one of those border states. Delaware, Maryland, [inaudible 00:00:14:05], they were all could not figure out how to get the other side. Thank God. So when I was a kid, I worked what they call the East side. And as a kid, I got deeply involved. I spent my time in the black church on Sunday. I must admit to you, after going to mass earlier in the morning. Mom, I really did, not a joke. But we’d sit there and we’d organize and we’d draw some hope from what was going on. But when I came home, I went away to law school because we had no law school Delaware at the time. When I came home, Dr. King, I only had two political heroes, Dr. King and Bobby Kennedy and folks, both were assassinated the last semester I was in school, in law school. When I came home and I had a job with a fancy law firm, good law firm, decent people, but my city, Wilmington, Delaware, is the only city in American history since the Civil War occupied by the military for 10 months, standing in each corner of drawing bayonets. As my wife, the professor, would say, you can Google it, no exaggeration. And what happened? I found myself in a position where I talked about all this time about being involved in the community. And after I got admitted to the bar in January, I realized I couldn’t stay in that law firm and I quit and became a public defender. Because, and I used to interview my clients down what they call the Northeast Carter, Amtrak Carter, that goes from all the way up the coast, particularly the high speed rail that goes from Washington to New York. And I used to interview my clients down there and I thought things would never get better, never get better. I thought blacks and whites would never be talking together again because the city was over 60% African American. Well, here I was literally 40 years to the month standing in that same platform at that same strange station, all of a sudden it hit me. I was waiting for a black man to come 26 miles from Philadelphia on a train to pick me up and take me a total of 147 miles south to Washington, DC to be sworn in as president and vice president United States of America. I call my three children, grown children. I called them up where I was standing and my son Beau, who is a war hero and the attorney general of the state of Delaware then. I said, and I called my son Hunter up, my heart. Beau is my soul. Hunter is my heart. He ran the World Food Program, excuse me, USA. And my daughter is a social worker and ran the largest criminal justice reform system in the state. And I called them up and I said, look, I said, look at the East side over here. It’s rebuilt. Look over at Third Street Bridge, it’s rebuilt. And I said, don’t tell me things can’t change. I’m about to be picked up by this man and we all celebrated. I thought I knew an awful lot about how to deal with hate in this. I thought you could defeat him, but I was wrong. What happened was in 2017 in Charlottesville, close your eyes and picture those folks coming out of the field with their veins bulging, carrying torches, carrying Nazi banners, David Duke saying, this is why we elected him, accompanied by white supremacists and a young woman was killed. And the president was asked to comment. He said something no American president ever said. He said, “there were very fine people on both sides.” By the way, it’s more than a boo. It’s a reality. No president has said that and that’s why they decided that I was going to run. That’s why I got in this race. I wrote an article in Atlantic magazine saying, we’re in the battle for the soul of the country and I meant it. By the way, it’s only gotten worse for him since then. The way he mocks people with disabilities. The way he talks down to people. The way treats minorities like we’re subhuman. The way he deals with and separates us. The way he even braces dictators around the world and pokes his finger in the eye of our allies. View of women. Look, his view of women is not even a view. No, I really mean it. I shouldn’t get going. But folks, we’re at a very perilous moment because we can God willing with the right nominee turn your children’s view of history into, well, four years after Barack Obama having this guy as president was an aberration, a historical aberration. But if we give him eight years, he will fundamentally alter the nature of who we are and that’s a fact. He’d change the nature of who we are and winning means uniting America. I know a lot of my colleagues think we have to look at the other side as the enemy. If we do that, we can never get anything done. Not showing more division and anger. The words of presidents matter. Not only means fighting, but healing, healing this country. We have to beat Donald Trump and the Republican Party, but we can’t become like them. We can’t become like them. We have to heal our divisions. Restore democracy. And above all, it’s time for America to get back up on its feet and once again fight for the proposition that we hold these truths to be self evident. Sounds corny, not a joke. Think about it. We hold these truths to be self evident, all men and women created by … You know the thing. You know how we talk about it. We the people, folks endowed by our creator certain unalienable rights. We’ve never lived up to that. We’ve never lived up to that. Thomas Jefferson, who wrote the words, never lived up to it, but we’ve never ever before walked away from it. Never. And I believe with every fiber in my being, that’s who we still are. We have always moved forward. We’ve always increased the aperture of inclusion more and more, and we have a chance now. A few days ago, I did a town meeting in Charleston, South Carolina. You might’ve seen it on CNN. I spoke to the Reverend Anthony Thompson whose wife Maya was studying the words of The Bible with eight of her parishioners at Mother Emanuel Church when a white supremacist entered their church four and a half years ago and gunned them all down. There was a weekly routine reading scripture, finding purpose and faith in God and in each other and in an instant hate’s vengeance pierced their faith lost forever. But what’s remarkable about Reverend Thompson and the families of the Emanuel nine is that through their pain and grief, he did something totally remarkable. They forgave the killer. They forgave the killer. I was there. They forgave the killer. And in their forgiveness, change that had been fought for over a hundred years in South Carolina began to occur. The Confederate Flag came down. Real change began to take place because they talked about healing. That Sunday, I came back to Mother Emanuel quietly, no press, no anybody, just to see to it because we, I just lost our son six weeks earlier and my family needed to be healed. So we came back and we worshiped with them because what it’s all about? It’s about healing. It’s about being reminded. Many of you have been through similar things that I’ve been through. Some of you worse than I’ve been through, but what do you need? You need purpose in your life. Purpose in reminding that those you lost are still part of you. Beau was my soul. Just like when I lost my wife and daughter, my two kids were not likely to live. With every day of every season that’s past, Reverend Thompson and other members of their congregation have gotten up and fought for purpose. Purpose of their lives, a purpose worthy of their loved ones, worthy of the blessings to live in this remarkable country of ours, and they’re the reason I’m in this race. You are the reason I’m in this race. People like you that have fought here today all around the country to deal with a crisis you’ve faced in your lives. The days of Donald Trump’s [de visitas 00:24:05], I promise you, will soon be over. We can and we must build a more perfect union. Because the American people have seen the alternative, so let’s get back up. We’re decent, we’re brave, we’re a resilient people. We can believe again. We’re better than this moment and we’re better than this president. So get up and let’s take back this country. We’re the United States of America. There’s nothing we cannot do if we do it together. God bless you all and may God protect our troops. Let’s take it back now. Now. Now. Now. Thank you."
"35","03-02-21"," The Vice President and I have some good news to report, and I’d like to make two key announcements today related to our COVID-19 vaccination effort. As you know, a few days ago, after a rigorous open and objective scientific review process, the Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization for the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine. We should all be encouraged by this news of a third safe and highly-effective COVID-19 vaccine. The more people who get vaccinated, the faster we’re going to overcome this virus and get back to our loved ones, get our economy back on track, and start to move back to normal. But that’s one of my first goals in office was, when I got in office, was to say that there’ll be 100 million vaccination shots administered in my first 100 days in office. We’ve got halfway to that goal in 37 days, and I feel confident we’ll make it all the way. And as I’ve said, we have a long way to go, but as I said from the outset, we’re going to use every resource of the Federal Government to make it happen. Among the things I learned when I came in office, was that Johnson & Johnson was behind in manufacturing and production. While we had the potential of another highly-effective vaccine to accompany the two existing vaccines, it simply wasn’t coming fast enough. So my team has been hard at work to accelerate that effort. As I’ve always said, this is a wartime effort, and every action has been on the table, including putting together breakthrough approaches. And today, we’re announcing a major step forward, two of the largest healthcare and pharmaceutical companies in the world, that are usually competitors, are working together on the vaccine. Johnson & Johnson and Merck will work together to expand the production of Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine. This is the type of collaboration between companies we saw in World War II. We also invoked the Defense Production Act, to equip two Merck facilities, to the standards necessary, to safely manufacture the J&J vaccine. And with the urging and assistance of my administration, Johnson & Johnson is also taking additional new actions to safely accelerate vaccine production. Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine manufacturing facilities will now begin to operate 24/7. In addition, we’ll continue to use the Defense Production Act to expedite critical materials in vaccine production, such as equipment, machinery, and supplies. I’ve also asked the Department of Defense to provide daily logistical support to strengthen Johnson & Johnson’s efforts. And I want to thank Johnson & Johnson and Merck for stepping up and being good corporate citizens during this national crisis. Here’s what all this means, we’re now on track to have enough vaccine supply for every adult in America by the end of May. Let me say that again. When we came into office, the prior administration had contracted for not nearly enough vaccine to cover adults in America. We rectified that. About three weeks ago, we were able to say that we’ll have enough vaccine supply for adults by the end of July. And I’m pleased to announce today, as a consequence of the stepped-up process that I’ve ordered and just outlined, this country will have enough vaccine supply, say it again, for every adult in America by the end of May, by the end of May. That’s progress, important progress, but it’s not enough to have the vaccine supply. We need vaccinators, people to put the shots in people’s arms, millions of Americans arms. Today, we brought back retired doctors and nurses, we deployed more than 1,500 federal medical personnel you usually see during national disasters, from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, and the Commissioned Health Corps at the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Defense Department, including the National Guard, with thousands more to come. We’re also increasing the places where people can get vaccinated. We’ve sent millions of vaccines to over 7,000 pharmacies, to make it easier for folks to get their COVID-19 vaccine shot, like they would their flu shot. The Federal Government is also working with states to set up hundreds of mass vaccination centers in places like stadiums, community centers, parking lots, that vaccinate thousands of people per day. My wife Jill, and I, just visited one in Houston last week, it’s incredible. Now, with this increased production of three safe and effective vaccines, we have an opportunity to help address the urgent national need more quickly, and getting our schools back open safely. Right now, an entire generation of young people is on the brink of being set back a year or more in their learning. You can ask millions of parents, they understand. We’re already seeing rising mental health concerns, due in part to isolation. Educational disparities that have always existed, grow wider each day that our schools remain closed, and remote learning isn’t the same for every student, as you all know. Our educators are doing everything they can to protect and educate our students, despite the lack of resources, and as districts face budget crises that risk education jobs. Moms and dads are exiting the workforce in astonishing numbers, in order to care for and manage the school experience for their children at home, hindering their own opportunities and further undermining the health of our economy. This is a national imperative that we get our kids back into the classroom safely and as soon as possible. As you know, back in December, I set a goal for having a majority of our K-8 schools opened by the end of my first 100 days as President. To achieve that goal, I sent the American Rescue Plan to Congress, to provide vital help to make sure schools can open safely, reopen safely. Essential things like more teachers to reduce class sizes, more buses and bus drivers, to transport our kids safely, and more space to conduct in-person instructions, and more protective equipment, school cleaning services, physical alterations to reduce the risk of the spread of the virus, all cost money. The House passed the American Rescue Plan last week. I hope the Senate will follow as quickly and as well. Also, the Center For Disease Control and Prevention, the CDC, issued new guidelines on how to reopen our school safely. It’s a roadmap that will enable schools if they have the resources they deserve to reopen safely. I have given those schools a roadmap. I’ve asked Congress to give them the tools, and today, to add one more tool to school reopening, a vaccinated workforce. Let me be clear, we can reopen schools if the right steps are taken, even before employees are vaccinated. But time and again, we’ve heard from educators and parents that have anxieties about that. So as yet another move to help accelerate the safer reopening of our schools, let’s treat in-person learning like an essential service that it is. And that means getting essential workers, provide that service, educators, school staff, childcare workers, get them vaccinated immediately, they’re essential workers. Over 30 states have already taken the step to prioritize educators for vaccination, and today, I’m using the full authority of the Federal Government, I’m directing every state to do the same. My challenge to all states, territories, and the District of Columbia is this, we want every educator, school staff member,, childcare worker to receive at least one shot by the end of the month of March. To help make this happen, starting next week and for the month of March, we’ll be using our Federal Pharmacy Program to prioritize the vaccination of pre-K through 12 educators and staff and childcare workers. Throughout March, they will be able to sign up for an appointment at a pharmacy near them. Now, I want to be very clear, not every educator will be able to get their appointment in the first week, but our goal is to do everything we can to help every educator receive a shot this month, the month of March. I want to conclude with this, we’re making progress from the mess we inherited. We’re moving in the right direction, and today’s announcements are a huge step in our effort to beat this pandemic. But I have to be honest with you, this fight is far from over. I told you I’d be straight up with you from the beginning. As I said many times, things may get worse again as new variants spread and as we face setbacks, like recent winter storms in the Midwest and South, but our administration will never take this public health threat lightly. Though we celebrate the news of a third vaccine, I urge all Americans, please keep washing your hands, stay socially distanced, wear masks, keep wearing them, get vaccinated when it’s your turn. Now is not the time to let up. I’ve asked the country to wear masks for my first 100 days in office. Now’s not the time to let our guard down, people’s lives are at stake. We have already, and I carry this in my pocket, lost more… As of today, we’ve lost more than 511,839 Americans, as of today. It’s got to stop. We need the United States Senate to follow the House and pass the American Rescue Plan, because despite the optimism, without new resources, our entire effort will be set back. We need the resources, the American Rescue Plan, and we need it urgently. We need them expanding testing, ramp up vaccine distribution, fund FEMA and other federal vaccine efforts, and continue reimbursing states for their efforts. We need the resources to expand genomic sequencing, to stay ahead of emerging variants, find the protective gear, transportation, staffing, and other costs required for school and businesses to open safely. We need to fund it. The bottom line is, we need the American Rescue Plan now, now. There is light at the end of the tunnel, but we cannot let our guard down now or assure that victory is inevitable. We can’t assume that. We must remain vigilant, act fast and aggressively, and look out for one another. That’s how we’re going to get ahead of this virus, get our economy again, and get back to our loved ones. Thank you, and please, please, it’s not over yet. Great news, but stay vigilant. May God bless you and may God protect our troops. Thank you all very, very much. [crosstalk 00:12:10]. Mr. When do I think things are to get back to normal? I’ve been cautioned not to give an answer to that because we don’t know for sure, but my hope is, by this time next year, we’re going to be back to normal, and before that, my hope. But again, it depends upon if people continue, continue to be smart and understand that we still can have significant losses. There’s a lot we have to do yet, so thank you. [crosstalk 00:12:47]. Yes, I did. A lot. [crosstalk 00:13:08]."
"36","03-03-20"," Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. It’s a good night. It’s a good night, and it seems to be getting even better. They don’t call it Super Tuesday for nothing. By the way, this is my little sister Valerie, and I’m Jill’s husband. Oh no, this is Valerie. You switched on me. This my wife. This is my sister. They switched on me. Folks, it’s still early, but things are looking awful, awful good. but things are looking off all from good. For those who’ve been knocked down, counted out, left behind, this is your campaign. Just a few days ago, the press and the pundits had declared the campaign dead, and then came South Carolina and they had something to say about it. We were told “Well, when you got to Super Tuesday, it would be over.” Well, it may be over for the other guy. Tell that to the folks in Virginia, North Carolina, Alabama, Tennessee, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Minnesota, and maybe even Massachusetts, it’s too close to call. We’re still waiting for Texas and California, few other small states to come in. But it’s looking good. So, I’m here to report, we are very much alive. Make no mistake about it. This campaign will send Donald Trump packing. This campaign is taking off. Join us. For those folks, listen, go to joebiden.com. Sign up, volunteer, contribute if you can. We need you. We want you, and there’s a place for you in this campaign. People are talking about a revolution. We started a movement. We even increased turnout. When the turnouts turn out for us, that can deliver us to a moment where we can do extraordinary, extraordinary things. Look, our agenda is bold. It’s progressive. It’s a vision, where health care is affordable and available to everybody in America, where we bring drug prices down under control with no more surprise billing, access to hospitals in rural areas as well as urban areas, access to care. A bold vision. We’re going to invest billions of dollars to find, and I promise you, cures for cancer, Alzheimer’s and diabetes, standing up to beating the NRA and the gun manufacturers, and leading the world to take on the existential and that of climate change. I’m going to start by rejoining an outfit I helped put together, the Paris Climate Accord, and we’re to move it a long way. A country where the quality of education will not depend on your zip code, where they triple funding for low income school district providing raises for teachers, full-time school for three, four and five years old, and increasing exponentially the prospects of their success. Free community college providing credentials for every job for the 21st century, and significant reduction in the cost of going to college and your student debt. If you volunteer, you pay nothing. Folks, we can do this. Let’s get something straight. Wall Street didn’t build this country, you built this country. [crosstalk 00:05:30] [inaudible 00:05:37]. We’re going to go. Look, the middle class is getting clobbered. The middle class is getting clobbered. Too many people in the neighborhoods that Jill and Val and I grew up in, [inaudible 00:05:58] are getting hurt. They’re badly hurt, and guess what? They’re the place where we come from. Many of you come from. It’s where we’re raised. The people. They’re the reason why I’m running. There’s a reason why I’m a Democrat in the first place. These are people that build our bridges, repair our roads, keep our water safe, who teach our kids, look, who race into burning buildings to protect other people, who grow our food, build our cars, pick up our garbage, our streets, veterans, dreamers, single moms, and by the way, every dreamer, have hope, because I’m coming and you’re not going anywhere. Now, we’re going to provide a pathway, a pathway for 11 million citizens. If the other guy had voted for the, well, I don’t know if she can get into that. I won’t get going. Look, the ironworkers, the steel workers, the boilermakers, the plumbers, the electrical work. These are the people that have been forgotten. I agree with you, man. Look, the people Trump forgot, the people I will never forgot. I will always remember. Folks, that’s where we need economy that rewards work, not just wealth, re-establishes the middle class, and this time brings everybody along, everybody regardless of their race, their ethnicity, whether their gender, their disabilities, economic state, Democrats, Republicans, Independents, every stripe. Look, like we did in South Carolina, like we did across American today, like we’ll do on our all the way to the White House. Look, that’s why I was so proud yesterday being embraced by Amy Klobuchar. We won Minnesota because of Amy Klobuchar, and we’re going well in Texas because of Beto O’Rourke. That’s why I was so proud, so incredibly proud, to have Mayor Pete’s endorsement as well. There’s a man of character, intellect and courage. By the way, I was proud to be endorsed by Jim Clyburn, man, he is something else. Look, our campaign reflects the diversity of this party in this nation, and that’s how it should be, because we need to bring everybody along, everybody. We want a nominee who will beat Donald Trump, but also also keep Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House, win back the United States Senate. If that’s what you want, join us. You want a nominee who’s a Democrat, a life long Democrat, a proud Democrat, an Obama Biden Democrat. Join us. Look, this all starts with a revival of decency and honor and character. Trump has fanned the flames of hate and sought to divide us. He’s insulted, demonized, and actually just the way he talks about people. He has not a single sense of empathy. He doesn’t have any compassion, no regard for the values that made this country who we are, not the way you were raised by your moms and dads. He looks at honesty and decency and respect and he views it as a sign of weakness. He doesn’t believe that we’re the beacon to the world. He doesn’t believe we’re all part of something bigger than ourselves. Folks, winning means uniting America, not sowing seeds of division and anger and hate. We got to beat Donald Trump, but we will, but we can’t become like him. We can’t have a never ending war between the parties. We need a President who can fight, but make no mistake about it, I could fight, but look, we need this badly, as badly, someone who could heal. Look, just look what we did when we passed Obamacare, what President Obama and I did saving the American automobile industry, or what we did to pass the Violence Against Women Act, but that’s not enough. This is just a start. We need a President who can heal the country as well, and that is what I will do as your President. I promise you. It’s about delivering real results for you, your family and the community. It’s not about me, Jill or Valerie. It’s about you. It’s about our families. To paraphrase the English poet Robert Brown and he said, “Our reach should exceed our grasp,” and my reach does exceed our grasp because there’s no doubt in my mind we can grasp whatever we reach for. Ladies and gentlemen, I quoted an English poet. Well, let me pull a real poet now, an Irish poet, Shamus Heaney, who wrote a poem called The Cure at Troy. Here’s what he says, and I believe this to the bottom of my bean. He said, “History says, don’t hope on this side of the grave, but then once in a lifetime, the long for tidal wave of justice rises up and hope and history rhyme.” We can make hope and history rhyme because of what we sing. There’s nothing we can’t do. This is about the future. It’s not about the past. It’s about our children and our grandchildren. It’s about leading this country and leading the world once again. Folks, we just have to remember who we are. My Lord, this is the United States of America, and it’s time for America to get back up, and once again, fight for the proposition that we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men and women are created equal, and that by the creator with certain inalienable rights. We say it so often in school, we don’t realize how profound it is. We’ve never lived up to those words, but up to this President, we’ve never walked away from it. Ladies and gentlemen, I believe with every fiber of my being, that’s who we are. So, let’s get back up. We are a decent, brave, resilient people. We can believe again, but we are better than this moment. We are better than this President. So, get back up and take back this country, the United States of America. There’s not a single thing we can’t do. God bless you and may God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We’re going to do this, folks. Thank you. Thank you, Vermont. It’s a funny thing. 31 years ago today, we won the mayoral race in Burlington, Vermont. And we won that race against all of the odds. Everybody said it couldn’t be done. And when we began this race for the presidency, everybody said it couldn’t be done. But tonight I tell you with absolute confidence, we’re going to win the Democratic nomination, and we are going to defeat the most dangerous president in the history of this country. We are going to win. We are going to defeat Trump, because we are putting together an unprecedented grassroots, multigenerational, multiracial movement. It is a movement which speaks to the working families of this country who are sick and tired of working longer hours for low wages and seeing all new income and wealth going to the top 1%. It is a movement which says the United States will have healthcare for all as a human right. It is a movement that says we will bring major reforms in education, making sure that all of our kids can go to college without coming out in debt. Now, what makes this movement unique is we are taking on the corporate establishment, we are taking it on the greed of Wall Street. The greed of the drug companies who charge us the highest prices in the world. The greed or the insurance companies. And given the existential crisis of climate change, we are saying to the fossil fuel industry… We are saying to the fossil fuel industry, their short-term profits on not more important than the future of our country, or the world. But we are not only taking on the corporate establishment, we’re taking on the political establishment. But we’re going to win because the people understand it is our campaign, our movement, which is best position to defeat Trump. You cannot beat Trump with the same old same old kind of politics. What we need is a new politics that brings working class people into our political movement. Which brings young people into our political movement. And which in November we’ll create the highest voter turnout in American political history. So we’re going to beat Trump because this will become a contrast in ideas. One of us in this race led the opposition to the war in Iraq, you’re looking at him. Another candidate voted for the war in Iraq. One of us has spent his entire life fighting against cuts in social security and wanting to expand Social Security. Another candidate has been on the floor of the Senate calling for cuts to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and veterans [inaudible 00:06:25]. One of us led the opposition to disastrous trade agreements, which cost us millions of good paying jobs. And that’s me. And another candidate voted for disastrous trade agreements. One of us stood up for consumers and said, “We will not support a disastrous bankruptcy bill.” And another candidate represented the credit card companies and voted for that disastrous bill. So here we are, we have two major goals in front of us and they are directly related. First, we must beat a president who apparently has never read the Constitution of the United States. A president who thinks we should be an autocracy, not a democracy. But second of all, we need a movement, and are developing a movement of black, white, Latino, native American, Asian American, gay and straight. People who are making it clear every day they will not tolerate the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality we are experiencing. We will not give tax breaks to billionaires when a half a million Americans sleep out of the streets. Will not allow 49% of all new income to go to the 1% when half of our people live paycheck to paycheck. Now, I don’t know what’s going to happen later tonight. We’re doing well in Texas right now. We won Colorado and I’m cautiously optimistic that later in the evening we can win the largest state in this country, the state of California. But no matter what happens, if this campaign, and I don’t know what will happen, but if it comes out to be a campaign in which we have one candidate who is standing up for the working class and the middle class, we’re going to win that election. And if we have another candidate who has received contributions from at least 60 billionaires, we’re going to win that election. And if there is another candidate in the race who is spending hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars, we’re going to tell him in America you cannot buy elections. So I am excited about where we are. We have come a long, long way. And I want to once again, thank the great state of Vermont and all of the people in the state, not only for the victory you gave our movement tonight, but for the years and years of love and support you have given me and my family. So Vermont, from the bottom of our hearts, thank you all very much. Let’s go on to the White House. Thank you. Hello, Detroit. Wasn’t Senator Stephanie Chang just fabulous? My name is Elizabeth Warren, and I’m the woman who’s going to beat Donald Trump. I am also going to help take back the Senate and put Mitch McConnell out of a job. So here we are, Michigan. You’ve got exactly one week until you start voting. As you know, right now, voting is going on in California and Massachusetts, pretty much still all over this country. I know results will still keep coming in through the night, but what I see happening is a lot of folks trying to turn voting into some complicated strategy. Pundits, friends, neighbors are all saying you have to second guess yourself on this. They’re playing games about prediction and strategy. But prediction has been a terrible business, and the pundits have gotten it wrong over and over. So here’s some … Here’s my advice. I’ve got some advice that I want to start with tonight. So here’s my advice: Cast a vote that will make you proud. Cast a vote from your heart, and vote for the person you think will make the best President of the United States of America, because I want you to think for a minute about this democracy. You, you are the ones who get to pick the person who will be the next President, and it is an awesome thing. You are going to do it right here in Michigan next week. People are doing it in California right now, and that’s what it means to have a democracy. I’m in this race because I believe I will make the best President of the United States of America. I want to tell you why. I was not born a politician, but I was born a fighter, and I want you to know this. Is this on? Good. I want you to know this. I’ve got to have a loud voice here. I come by this honest. I think that maybe the reason I fought all my life is because I learned this from my mother. I want to tell you a story about me. I grew up in Oklahoma. Okay, we’ve got a few Okies here. I grew up in Oklahoma. I am the baby. I have three much older brothers. They all went off and joined the military. I am what used to be called a late-in-life baby. My mother always just called me the surprise. Yep. My three brothers are all retired. They’re back in Oklahoma now. To this day, they are referred to as the boys. That’s to distinguish them from the surprise. Now, when I was in middle school, all three of the boys were gone by then, and it was just my mom and my daddy and me. My daddy had a heart attack. He pulled through, but he couldn’t work for a long, long time, and I still remember the day when we lost the family station wagon. I remember how my mother used to tuck me in at night, and she would always kiss me and give me this big smile. I knew what was coming next. She’d leave my room, close the door, and then I’d hear her start to cry. She never wanted to cry in front of me, and I knew that. This is when I learned words like “mortgage” and. “foreclosure.” One day, I walked into my folks’ bedroom, and laid out on the bed was the dress. Now, some of you in this room will know the dress. It’s the one that only comes out for weddings, funerals, and graduations. There, down by the foot of the bed, was my mother. She had on her slip, and she was in her stocking feet. She was pacing back and forth, and she was saying, “We will not lose this house. We will not lose this house. We will not lose this house. She was 50 years old. She had never worked outside the home, and she was terrified. So she looks up, and she sees me standing in the doorway. I’m just a kid. She looks at me, and she looks at that dress. She looks back at me, and she walks over. She pulls that dress on, she puts on her high heels, and she walks to the Sears, where she gets a full-time minimum wage job answering phones. That minimum wage job saved our house, and it also saved our family. That is the first lesson my mother taught me, and that is no matter how scared you are, no matter how hard it looks, you get out there, and you fight for the people you love. That’s what I believe. That’s what I believe. Here’s the thing about that story. I’ve always carried that in my heart. You want to know who I am? There it is. But I’ll tell you another thing about that story. That story is a story about my mother. It’s a story about millions of people all across this country who do this every single day. But it is also a story about government, because understand this. When I was a kid, a full-time minimum wage job in America would support a family of three. It would cover a mortgage, it would pay the utilities, and it would put food on the table. Today, a full-time minimum wage job in America will not keep a mama and a baby out of poverty. That is wrong, and that is why I am in this fight. I’ll tell you something else about that. That change did not happen by accident. That change was not the result of gravity. That change happened because of who government works for. Today, the question asked in Washington for setting the minimum wage is, “What will maximize the profits of giant multinational corporations?” Well, I don’t want a government that works for giant multinational corporations. I want one that works for our families, and I’ve got a plan for that. In fact, I’ve got a lot of plans for that. So I want to tell you just a little story. I’m going to skip over a bunch of stuff. I just want to tell you a little story about what it means to get in a fight. So, in the late 1990s and the early 2000s, I was watching what was happening. I was studying families that go broke. What I was starting to see over and over were people who were getting cheated on mortgages, that they had their own homes already, and someone would come and sell them a mortgage to refinance their home and, by golly, refinance them right out of it. The banks were making more and more money, and more and more families were getting hurt. They started out by targeting communities of color, African American homeowners, Latinx homeowners. They went after seniors, and I started ringing alarm bells everywhere I could. “We’ve got a real problem over here,” and here’s what I discovered. Nobody wanted to hear it. When your ears are stuffed with money, it’s hard to hear. So the banks kept on selling those mortgages, and the regulators just looked the other way. The regulators were so deep in the pocket of the banks, they couldn’t even hear what was going on. Sure enough, economy crashed in 2008. We just loaded up on that much debt. Brought it down. But I hope you all feel better the banks got bailed out. Millions of families got left behind. Families right here in Detroit got left behind. Millions of people lost their jobs. Millions of people saw their pension fund shrink over and over. This pain was felt by families all across this country. So I decided, at this point, “Wait a minute. We’re going to make it through this crisis. There’s going to be financial reform. By golly, this financial reform is going to have some protection to make sure that we never wreck this economy again with a bunch of banks cheating people. So I had this idea for an agency, right? Man, that sounds sexy. So I had this idea for this agency, and the basic idea is the same as the idea behind the safety. We have Consumer Product Safety Commission. You can’t sell a toaster in America that has a one in five chance of burning down your house. You shouldn’t be able to sell a mortgage that has a one in five chance, which these did, of costing a family their home. So that’s the basic idea, and I wanted an agency. I don’t want a single law. I wanted an agency, because I knew, “The banks will rework these things. They’ll give it another name. They’ll figure out how to rewire it.” So I wanted an agency that would have one job: just to be on the side of families, to make sure they don’t get cheated on … Let’s make it all of it, mortgages, credit cards, payday loans, student loans. You don’t get cheated on financial products. So that’s the basic idea. So I go to Washington. Now, remember, I’m not in elected office. That’s not my job. I’m a full-time teacher and researcher. Let’s hear it for the nerds. Yes. So I go to Washington, and, basically, I knock on doors, anybody who’ll talk to me, Democrat, Republican, I don’t care. I’m just trying to pitch the idea for this agency. We’re in a crisis. We’re going to rewrite the laws. Let’s get this agency in it, and here’s what happened. Basically, I started getting the same two answers from everybody. This just really knocked me over. The first answer was, “Huh. That’s actually a pretty good idea. You could make a real difference. That’s structural change. That would actually make a difference in the market.” The second half to the answer was, “Don’t even try. You’ll be up against the banks. You’ll be up against Wall Street. You’ll be up against all of the Republicans and, shoot, you’ll be up against half the Democrats on this. You will never get it done. Yeah. So I heard this, and I thought, “I get it. Big, structural change is hard, but it is the right thing to do.” So we got in this fight and took on the big banks. They were spending more than a million dollars a day for nearly a year just trying to fight back against this and the other financial reforms. But, boy, this was the heart of it. They were out there. We fought the Republicans. We fought them all. But we built the coalitions, and, in 2010, Barack Obama signed that agency into law. Dang. Here’s the thing. Here’s the thing. That little agency has now forced the banks to return more than $12 billion directly to people they’ve cheated. So I take away two lessons from that. The first is you don’t get what you don’t fight for. I am in this fight. The second, and this is really important, after 40 years of Ronald Reagan’s trickle down economics, the second … Ah, I see you’ve heard of Ronald Reagan’s trickle down economics. But the second lesson I learned about this agency, as we built this agency, is we can make government work for the people. That’s what this agency has done, and that’s why being here with you tonight is about two things for me. It’s about the fight, but it’s also about the hope. It’s about what we will be able to do together. So that’s why I’m here. We can win the voters who will decide the general election. I spent a whole year focusing on the first four states. I was out campaigning against Donald Trump in the states where the election will actually be decided. Like Wisconsin and Michigan and Pittsburgh and Ohio and North Carolina and of course, Florida. President Obama proved that a Democrat can win all of those states. But in 2016 we lost them all. Well, I’m running to win them back. And together we’re going to get it done. Now we all know Trump’s strategy, attack Democrats make their plans look unrealistic, unaffordable, and un-doable. That won’t work against us. Our plans are sensible, workable, and achievable. And we have the record and the resources to defeat Trump in swing states the Democrats lost in 2016 like Florida. I know we can do it and you know who else knows it? Donald Trump. And that’s why he keeps attacking us on Twitter. Today he sent a tweet out urging people not to vote for us. Gee, I wonder why? Clearly Trump is scared stiff of facing us and for good reason. In every campaign I ran for mayor, we built a broad coalition that brought Democrats and Independents and Moderate Republicans together. Donald Trump the other day called me short. I said, “Donald, where I come from, we measure people from the neck up. That’s how we’re going to beat Donald Trump. I believe we need a leader who is ready to be Commander in Chief, not College Debater in Chief. So if you want someone who talks turkey, and now has a record of accomplishment on all the big issues facing our country, and who has the resources to beat Trump, I’m your guy. While Trump tweets, I follow facts, respect data, and tell the truth. My whole career I have been a doer. And I believe we need less talk, less partisanship, less division, less tweeting. Now you’ve all heard our campaign slogan, “Mike, will get it done.” Well, let me tell you what the it is. It means winning this November and sending Donald Trump back to Mar-a-Lago permanently. But that’s just the beginning because getting it done means finally providing health insurance to every American who lacks it. Getting it done means passing common sense gun safety laws to protect our children and communities. Getting it done means making America a global leader in the fight against climate change. Getting it done means creating good jobs with higher wages. Getting it done means addressing discrimination and inequality. Getting it done means creating a path to citizenship and finally fixing our broken immigration system. And getting it done means protecting a woman’s right to choose. Our campaign is a fight for America’s ideals and values. It’s a fight to build a better future for everyone not to bring back a pass that left so many out. It’s a fight we cannot afford to lose. So I need your help and I need your vote. And when you talk to your friends and families. Thank you. Just tell them, if you want quality health insurance for everyone, not just empty promises. If you want to combat inequality with fair taxes and better jobs. If you support my commitment to public education, no matter what zip code you live in. If you share my belief for opportunity for all and not just for a few. If you are ready to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States of America. And if you are ready to clean out the Oval Office and get things done. Then welcome to Bloomberg 2020. Thank you.   The rest of the Super Tuesday speeches are being transcribed, thank you for your patience"
"37","03-05-21"," … service to others. And with that, I will turn it over to the President of the United States. Thanks for being here, everybody. This is important and I appreciate you being willing to come and tell your stories. I wanted this to be a conversation about what the impact of the $1,400 at our plan has for every American out there. And to make sure that I understand what you think is important about it, if you think it’s important. And I also want to know, people you’re about to meet, millions of people who are going to help with this, I think, with this check, that’s going to make a big difference in terms of their lives. People in the country are hurting right now with less than two weeks from enhanced unemployment checks being cut out and 7 million kids don’t have enough food, 13 million people are behind in their rent. The American Rescue Plan, I believe, and according to the polling data, the vast majority of Americans believe, is essential to giving them some help and to turn it around. I think it’s going to provide immediate relief for millions of people that are going to be able to use it in a very constructive way and also grow the economy in the process. But it’s essential getting kids back to school safely. It is also getting a lifeline to small businesses. Many of whom, 400,000, have gone under, affecting entire communities. And it is clearly, clearly necessary, a lifeline for getting the upper hand against COVID-19 and getting it under control. That isn’t some academic discussion. It’s about you. It’s about people like you and families I grew up with all over America and you’ve all lived lives of service. You not only have taken care of yourself and your families, but you have lived lives of service to help other people as well. And so again, this isn’t an academic discussion. You deserve our thanks and our support, and I’m going to hand it back to Cedric so we can hear from you all while the press is still in here. Well, thank you, Mr. President. Today, we’re joined by three outstanding Americans that exemplified what America stands for and especially your values, which is service to others. First we have Ms. Alma Williams. Ms. Williams is a para-transit driver. She transports disabled Americans every day. She has four wonderful children and her youngest is in the process of applying to college. The other two are in college and one is on her way. So Ms. Williams is close to being a empty-nester. Then we have George Kerr who served in the United States Navy for almost eight years, served on two Air Force carriers and he volunteers, but also is starting a nonprofit small business to help people with substance use issues and health and harm affects. And he has, which you mentioned earlier, the unfortunate experience of having a house that burned down. And I know that that experience very well. He’s just a remarkable individual. And then we have Ms. [Lita Vanagus 00:13:07], who volunteers at a DC community health center and spends her time counseling and helping Americans get through this very rough time. She has seen the effects firsthand of the challenges and the pain and the suffering that American citizens are going through, which is particularly important that you say, through no fault of their own. And with that, Mr. President, I’m going to turn it back over to… Now, well turn it over to Ms. Williams so that she can tell us about what she thinks about the American Rescue Plan. Actually a wonderful plan. As well as being a para-transit operator, I’m also a union rep for the ATU. ATU. Yes, sir. And just hearing the things that my coworkers go through, it’s devastating. We’re fighting to work a maximum of less than 40 hours a week. I got traded to a colleague of mine. We had a time where we paid our bills on the first of the month and now we’re struggling to pay them on the 15th. Yeah. It’s just a hard time financially, mentally, emotionally, across the board for children, adults. I thank you for the plan. I think it will help a wide range of people, not just the working class, but all retirees, elementary school, grade school. I have nieces and nephews who are very young and just the transition of going to school every day and not being home all day, stuck behind the computer, it’s draining for them too, and they don’t understand it. I have a lot of questions, but I’m going to wait until we hear, while the press is here, to hear from all three people. Yes, sir. I’d like to talk more about this, if I can. Thank you, Mr. President. With that, we’ll turn it over to you, Mr. Kerr. Well, once again, thank you for having me. It’s really important that we’re having this conversation. I’m in full support of this piece of important legislation. As you said, I lost my home November 30th, 2019. And then right after that, I got really sick and then COVID happened. Thankfully, I have not contracted COVID, but it’s led to a lot of other issues and having my own LLC, it’s very difficult to find contracts right now because of the environment and people just don’t have the funding to get the support they need. And so, I do a lot of work with different organizations. One of them is Mary’s House for Older Adults, where we have a reach out and touch someone who talks to seniors, LGBTQ seniors, about isolation and being in contact with them. And so mental health is just a real important, and I’m glad to see there’s a lot of money in there for mental health services, because it’s incredibly important. At the same time, my community, the LGBTQ community, is under attack on a constant basis. The trauma that’s around there needs to be addressed. I’m hoping and praying that you will be able to sign in law the Equality Act. So am I. Thank you. And last, but certainly not least is Ms. Lita Vanagus. Well, first of all, thank you so much. Thank you for allowing Mary Center, on behalf of Mary Center being me here in order to share the story of the many, many families that we have served during this pandemic. For those of you who don’t know Mary Center, we’re a community health center, we’re a federally qualified health center and we serve over 60,000 families in the DC region. We have been in service for 33 years. I been with Mary Center for 19 years. And I guess we’ve seen it all, especially during this pandemic. The beauty of Mary Center, the way I said is that we have this unique model, Mr. President, that really tackles all the issues of our families. It’s not only medical. We provide social services, behavioral health, educational services. So that’s the way that we have been able to support our families and move them back up to the economic ladder, especially during this time. It’s interesting, I was checking and I think if not mistaken, a year ago today, is when the first case of COVID came to Maryland, right? And two days later in DC. Since day one, Mary Center has been on the front lines and the response and recovery process, so far, we have done more than 20,000 COVID tests. A lot of them unfortunately have been positive. We serve about from our 60,000 participants, we serve around 70% of them are Latino and minorities have been very impacted. And so we received vaccine back in December. We have vaccinated around 1,200 individuals. But if you put it in perspective, serving 60,000 participants, and let’s say 50% are adults over 18 that can get the vaccine, so we still have almost 30,000 people that still need the vaccine. But we know, Mr. President, that that will multiply in a few weeks because we’re trustful that you’ll deliver on the promise of vaccinating 100 million people soon. And so, if you asked me what our families have gone through, they have gone through everything. Just by hearing Alma and George’s stories, it just breaks my heart because this is the same situation. They’re losing jobs. That’s the main thing, you know that, and with that, they have unstable housing, food insecurity. They’re traveling long distances to go and visit the food distribution site and that’s every day. Then they do lone lines and next day they have to do the same. So it’s been hard and because they haven’t been able to pay rent, now they’re moving with other people to live together. And so they’re sleeping on couches, on the floor. They’re always have been affected. And because they have lost jobs, a few of them have kept the jobs, but few hours, but they still need to go outside. So when they go, they’re at risk of being infected and then they come back and they have the family. So it’s this circle of situations that have been impacting all of our families. So with that comes mental health, trauma, anxiety, and our children don’t have laptops. We have been able to distribute about 1000 laptops or more, but if they have one laptop, but they have three children, how can they all be in school on the same day? So they have to choose. Or they don’t have internet connection. So there’s a lot around that and we’ve been trying to support as much as possible. Well, thank you, all of you for what you do. I carry a schedule card every day. On the back of the car, I list on a daily basis, how many people have died from COVID in the United States. As of today 517,224, not over 500,000. 517,224 and we will meet the hundred million shots. We’re up to 82,572,848 shots. We’re going to get this done. But I’m going to ask some questions now. The press are going to leave and I’m going to get more personal with you if I can, asking questions. Okay."
"38","03-10-20"," Watch how the state of Michigan is about to change the country and change the world. We’re going to have a lot more to say tonight, but I wanted to say thank you for showing up Detroit. Like we always do, let’s stand tall and let’s win over here tomorrow. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome [Sade 00:10:11] Reed, senior class president of Renaissance High School and Valedictorian. And also, please rise for our pledge of allegiance. Good evening. My name is Sade Reed, I am the senior class president as well as valedictorian here at Renaissance. Please join me in reciting the pledge of allegiance. So take your right hand and put it on your heart. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the Mayor of Detroit, Mayor Duggan. All right. Are we ready to hear from the vice president? As many of you know, I signed up for Joe Biden’s campaign the first day he announced for president. Right? And we had some times there where it looked a little rocky. Didn’t it? People said to me, “How come you’re still with him? He’s losing. You should switch.” Here’s what I said, “Here’s what I know, in 2009 when GM and Chrysler were on the verge of bankruptcy and everybody thought they were in trouble, it was Barrack Obama and Joe Biden who went in and fought for us. They believed in us. And you know what Joe Biden and I are doing at 9:30 tomorrow? We’re going over to the Fiat Chrysler plant where they’re hiring 5000 new autoworkers in the city of Detroit. Those 5000 jobs wouldn’t be there if Barrack Obama and Joe Biden hadn’t believed in us. And then New Hampshire came and Iowa came and they said “Joe Biden is going to lose.” Everybody else coming, “Come join our team. Joe Biden can’t win.” I said, “Let me tell you what I know. In 2014 when I became mayor and Detroit was in bankruptcy, Joe Biden came to Detroit every three or four months. He got us new buses. He got us housing. He got us business support.” When the rest of the country had written us off, he was there. And when I went to the White House and sat with President Obama he said, “The only problem I have with Joe is he thinks he’s the vice president of Detroit.” True story. He was with us every step of the way. And now, are we ready to stand with Joe Biden? I want to bring up somebody else who has beaten all the odds, who has come from the city of Detroit and risen to the highest levels of power, our great congresswoman. Give a great applause for Congresswoman Brenda Lawrence. Hello Detroit. The road to the White House runs through where? Michigan. Michigan. We are on board, we are fighting. We understand that the soul of our democracy rests in our hands. I am so excited to be here today. And men, if you would just allow me a moment to talk to the women in the house. Women, are you in the house? Women, we are the majority of the vote. Are we going to win this race? See women know that the importance of educating our children is so important and they know Joe Biden will make sure a child is educated regardless of their zip code. Women, we know that we are the number one caretakers in America. And we know Joe Biden will protect and make Obamacare work for us. Are you with me? And tot he men in the house so you don’t feel bad, every woman in this house needs you to lock arms with us as we fight to bring back democracy to our country. Ooh, I love that bass. I love that bass. We have an opportunity in this state with your vote to bring back something that I believe in so much. You heard the young lady say it, we have an opportunity to have one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all of us. But it only happens when we fight and make that happen. I want you to know that when I stand up and say “I support Joe Biden to be the next President of the United States of America” that I need all hands on deck. I need teachers. I need truck drivers. I need those who are unemployed seeking employment. I need the factory worker. I need the engineer. Are in of y’all in the house? Are there any teachers in the house? Are there any nurses in the house? I need everyone onboard. As we spread the word and we create this excitement about our democracy, I tell people I’m supporting Joe Biden because he knows me. He knows me. He sees me. He understands that there are those in America who work two jobs just to make a living. He understands that there are those who are caring for a sick child and we need healthcare for all. He understands that Obamacare is one that can work if we didn’t have this administration trying to cut the legs out from under it. We understand that economic development that when we talk about people increasing their wealth and growing in America that no ships are left behind, that we all rise with this tide. I’m so excited to be here today to say I want you to join arms with me because when we fight? When we fight? When we fight? When we fight? And we will win. Go vote tomorrow, everybody. Thank you. I now have the pleasure to introduce an amazing young man, a young man who, when he was selected to run on the ticket with our governor, he came to me because I was a Lieutenant governor candidate and I was so proud to talk to him and to nurture him and support him because, you know, I know he stands on my shoulders. He’s brilliant man. He’s an amazing father. He is my Lieutenant governor. He is a man that we in Michigan are so blessed to have. Join me in welcoming our Lieutenant Governor Gilchrist. He’s upstairs with the vice president so you all just hang loose. He’ll be down in a minute. But I want to know, do we have anyone here from the city of Detroit? The city of Southfield, the Grosse Pointe, Farmington Hills? Oh, here he comes. Bye. Now y’all heard from me a little bit earlier, but I’ve got to say it one more time, what up though Detroit? My name is Garlin Gilchrist and in case y’all ain’t heard, I live in Detroit and I’m happy to be standing before you as the first black Lieutenant Governor of the state of Michigan. I’m going to tell y’all why that’s important. Because, in the year 2018, the city of Detroit turned out like it never did for a gubernatorial election. The state of Michigan stepped up like it hadn’t been for a gubernatorial election in more than 40 years. And when we turn out? When we stand tall? When we show up? And when we win we get the most reflective administration that has ever existed in the history of the state of Michigan. You get a governor like Gretchen Whitmer. For the first time in the history of the state, women have held every executive office. You have an attorney general like Dana Nessel. You have a secretary of state like Jocelyn Benson. You have a Whitmer/Gilchrist administration that appoints the most diverse cabinet and leadership team in the history of the state of Michigan. And that’s important because when we show up [crosstalk 00:22:34] and the people who govern, they actually look like us. That matters because when you have diversity at the table, you get better decisions. You get stronger consensus. You need to have leadership that is willing to listen to people. Leaders that are willing to bring everyone into the conversation because we don’t have conversations about people, we have conversations with people. We don’t talk about communities, we speak with communities. We don’t act alone because we don’t lead alone. Leadership is not an individual exercise. Leadership is a communal experience where we come together under our best values. We organize our better angels to walk brightly into a better tomorrow. And we are all here tonight united with a common purpose because we believe that Joe Biden is going to be the best nominee and the next president of the United States. But the question everybody asks is, “Why should you vote for Joe Biden tomorrow? Why is Joe Biden the best person to lead our party and lead our country?” It’s real simple Detroit. Three Rs. Results, record, and relationship. The three Rs of Joesph R. Biden. The results, he has shown up in this state time after time, before, during, and beyond election season. He’s delivered for public transportation. He’s delivered for internet access. He’s delivered to expand healthcare. And he has delivered because when the auto industry was down, President Barack Obama said send Joe Biden to Detroit. Send Joe Biden to Michigan to protect the middle class. To undergird the auto industry that is the lifeblood of our state because everybody in here either works in or loves somebody who works in the auto industry. That is the man that we chose to stand tall for the state of Michigan. I’ve got to be honest with you. All right? Don’t get mad at me. Don’t get mad at me. In 2016, I voted for Bernie Sanders. Now look, now look, I’m sad that somebody booed about that. That’s what happened in 2016, but the question is, what’s different? What’s different? The difference is, nobody with the record, results, and relationships of Joe Biden was on the ballot. And what we need in 2020 is somebody that’s going to have a vision that includes all of us. Because we are a broad, diverse, beautiful people, where everybody’s opinion matters. And when Joe Biden looks to build a team, when Joe Biden looks to build a coalition, he doesn’t look away from any person. He doesn’t look away from any community. Instead, he looks to empower leaders. He looks to empower people to help make a difference. That’s why I’m voting for Joe Biden tomorrow. You see, Joe Biden has been here earning our support before he asked for it. But tonight, he’s going to ask you for it. What are we going to say? We going to say yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. I love y’all so much. When we vote? When we stand up? When we fight? When we unite? When we stand tall? God bless you Detroit. Thank you. Let’s go elect Joe Biden tomorrow. How y’all feeling? What up baby? How y’all feeling? One two. Yes, yes. Listen. For those of you who don’t know, I’m Mike Bivins. I’m part of two singing groups, New Edition and Bell Biv DeVoe. And the reason I’m here today is because I have one of the best conversations as an adult with the Vice President, Mr. Joe Biden. And what we talked about is some of the things that he wants to do when we elect him as the President this year. Making sure that the youth understand the things that are important. But he asked us to come here today to talk to you about the importance of voting and what it means. This election now is crucial, is critical. We see what we up against. We see what we faced with. But guess what, Detroit? This city is resilient and last week, we saw resilience in South Carolina y’all. Now they had our man counted out a little bit. But that was like a Smokin’ Joe Frazier fight. He came back. He had to come back like Joe Louis. But what I would say here in Detroit, what I love so much about this city is y’all keep it real. Y’all help people understand the fabric of your city and how much pride y’all take in this city. I know tonight when he comes out on this stage, he’s going to come with that same spirit that was just in South Carolina to make you feel calm. To make you feel good about your voice. Let’s not waver. We need each other more now than ever. And I’m not here standing up here as a celebrity. And there’s so many other eloquent people backstage that I got a chance to meet that I never met before, but I realize we’re all getting together. So as I see some of you for the first time, some of y’all some been to Charleston. Some of y’all been to the Fox. Y’all know what it is. Put a fist up in the air Detroit one time. Put a fist up in the air one time. No keep that fist up. When I hung up that call, I say, “Yo Joe, we boys now. We friends. I’m getting on the front line. But out of respect, can I call you JB?” He said, “Yes. All right. Thank you. Great. Well Detroit, I am thrilled to be here with you because I got to tell you. I’ve felt better in the last 10 days than I have in 10 months. And here’s why. I decided to jump on and endorse Joe Biden. And you know why? Because Joe knows Michigan. Joe cares about Michigan. He cares about people like Michigan all across the country. Well I got to tell you. As a 29 year old, I became a member of what’s known as the sandwich generation. That means I was sandwiched between two generations of my own family for whom I was the primary caregiver. My mom, she was dying of brain cancer, and my daughter, who was a newborn. That doesn’t make me unique because there’s a lot of people that are doing that. But I was also fighting an insurance company that was wrongfully denying my mom’s chemotherapy. I have commiserated with Joe Biden about this because the brain tumor that killed my mother is the same one that took Beau Biden’s life. I know that he and Barack Obama expanded healthcare in this country so almost 700000 Michiganders got healthcare. And if that’s not personal enough to many of us here in Michigan, I’ll tell you what else is. That’s right. Barack Obama and Joe Biden. They came to the rescue when people counted us out. When people say, “Let it fail,” they said, “No. We are in because Michigan’s important.” They had our backs and so today, I say let’s have Joe Biden’s back. In a political discourse, where it is so nasty, where people are looking to fracture us and divide us, burn bridges, build walls, we need someone who will build bridges, and that who Joe Biden is. That’s what this is all about. You know, I know this. We won in 2018 by big numbers because why? We showed up. We stayed focused on the dinner table issues. We showed a record of getting things done, and we build a coalition. As a Democrat, I can say this. I am proud of all the people that put their names on this ballot to run for President. There is a source of inspiration in every one of them. Whether it was Pete Buttigieg or it was Elizabeth Warren, or Amy Klobuchar. Whether it was… I don’t know, a couple other people that I’m thinking about. All right, hold on. I’m getting there. What I love about Joe Biden though is he knows how to build a coalition. I’m riding with Biden and everyone else has a seat too. But it takes coalitions to win. And this campaign looks like this country and it looks like this state. And with that, I am happy to introduce Exhibit A. My good friend who is here to join us all and tell us why he decided to jump in, my friend, the phenomenal senator from New Jersey, Cory Booker. All right! Hello everybody. It is good to be back in Detroit. I think we have something in common everybody, because this morning, I made it official. I have hereby endorsed Joe Biden for President of the United States. I am so proud to be on Joe’s team because Joe is on your team. I am so proud to be with Joe because Joe is with all of us. And when I get here to Detroit, I feel like I got some Detroit cred, because my mama was born right here in this city. My grandfather worked on the assembly lines. He was a UAW union worker and I’m proud of that. My grandfather used to tell me a story about how he back in the days that black folks were Republicans and he went out when FDR was on the ballot and told people to turn Lincoln’s picture to the wall because we are going with the Democratic Party. Because this party is not the party of me. It’s the party of we. This is the party of civil rights. Of voting rights. Of women’s rights. Of workers’ rights and unions. It’s the party of Social Security. It’s the party of Medicare and Medicaid. It’s the party that believes in this radical concept… I don’t know if y’all ever heard of it. It’s called science. But something happened. Something happened four years ago. We got to tell the truth now. Our nation, which every generation was trying to make a more perfect union elected a President that is trying to rip us apart. He looks at the most vulnerable and doesn’t try to lift them up. He tries to tear them down. It seems like he takes great pleasure in pitting American against American. We got knocked back. We got knocked down four years ago, but like this high school, Renaissance High School… whose very mascot is the phoenix… it is time for us as a nation to rise on up! Because America, when the going gets tough, we don’t shut up. We don’t give up. We don’t curl up. We stand up. We speak up. And there is one man now who’s ready to go to the center of the arena who is our best shot to beat Donald Trump. He is the best one to heal the soul of America. He is the best one to bring dignity back to that office. He is the best one to stand up for all of us in America. And that person is one person. Oh but you got to help me now. You got to help me now. You got to give me some help. Because he can’t do it alone. He can’t do it alone. Oh help me now. He can’t do it alone. We can’t pray that he wins. We can’t hope that he wins. We can’t wish that he wins. We got to vote him in. So this is on all of you. We know what our ancestors said. Without struggle, there is no progress. Know what our ancestors said. We’ve got to turn our worrying into work. We know what our ancestors have said. We’ve got to turn our anger into action. Michigan you have a chance to decide which way do we go. Do we go into the low road, into the quicksand, where we see the better days of America disappear under the sun? Or do we go the high road and get to the mountaintop and proclaim that we are a nation where liberty still reigns, where freedom is still real for everyone. Where every American has healthcare. Where we have a criminal justice system that ends the nightmare of where it is as it is today. Bryan Stevenson says treating you better if you’re rich and guilty than if you’re poor and innocent. Where people work hard all their lives and can’t retire with security. Where people can’t afford their prescription drugs, so they put aside their insulin or their asthma inhalers. This is what we have to do right now is remember that this nation was built on patriotism and patriotism is love of country. And you cannot love your country unless you love your fellow countrymen and women. So I want to ask you right now. Are you ready to work for Joe Biden? Are you ready to stand for Joe Biden? Are you ready to vote for Joe Biden? Well I’ll tell you what. I tell you I hear it now. I feel the energy, but tomorrow it starts. And so you got to know something. When I go to the Senate and I feel like we got some momentum, I sometimes have to call in the cleanup hitter of the Senate. Because I know Joe is about to come on this stage, but we got one more person who is… Now she is a rising star in America. She is lightning bringing the light. She is one of our power people. And I think y’all have to understand. We are sparing nothing to make sure that Joe Biden wins the state of Michigan. And so, one more voice, a voice of change, a voice of hope, a voice of tomorrow, a voice of today. What’s up Detroit? Always good to be back. Can we hear it for Cory Booker? Gretchen Whitmer, one of the greatest [inaudible 00:53:54]. All right, all right. We got to get to work. So wait a minute, I know we’re celebrating, but we’re celebrating the work that we’re about to do for the next 24 hours, right? Because we got some work to do everybody, we got some work to do. Michigan, I do believe you are going to make the difference in terms of the outcome of selection. I do believe that. I do believe that. And when I look at this great state, it is the bell weather, it is the measure of how America is doing and what America is capable of doing. And when you put the kind of fight and work that you have always put into investing in the future of America, we will elect Joe Biden as the next President of the United States. And you know, I believe Joe is right when he says this election is a fight for the soul of America. He’s right. You know, you all have heard me say many times, I do believe this is an inflection moment in the history of our country. This is a moment in time where we have to look in a mirror and ask ourselves, “Who are we?” And I think we all know. We are better than this. We are better than this. And what we have witnessed in these last three years, are powerful forces that have been trying to sow hate and division among us. They are voices that have been trying to divide us and have us turn against each other. Here’s my theory about it. I believe there has been a conscious attempt to try and disillusion us. Trying to have us believe that the systems cannot and will not ever work for us. Trying to have us believe that we cannot trust our democracy. Trying to have us believe that we don’t matter. Powerful forces that I believe consciously have been trying to say to you, “You don’t matter. So don’t participate because you can’t make a difference.” They’re trying to say to us, “Do not trust your government.” They’re trying to convince us that we are alone. But see what we know is the power is with the people. The power is with the people. What we know is that we will not be overlooked and we will not be canceled. We will not be canceled. We will not be canceled. So that’s what this election is about. It’s about saying, “We know we matter. We know the power is with the people. Yes, we have not achieved the ideals of our country yet. We all know that too. But we know that if we stop fighting, we will never get there and so we fight.” That is the strength of who we are as a nation. The strength of who are as a nation has always been about fighting for our ideals. And so let’s talk about the Joe we know. Let’s talk about the Joe we know. I’m going to tell you. I am so proud to be able to endorse Joe Biden to be the next President of the United States. I believe in Joe. I believe in Joe. You know, one of the things that is so reflective of his personality is when he says, “There is room for everyone,” but that’s who he is. That’s really who he is. He is an individual who has lived a life of incredible service to others. He has made great personal sacrifices in his life. He has experienced in life great pain and great glory. He understands who people are. And you know, I’ve been in Washington DC for about three years now and I’m going to tell you something. He doesn’t get it. Donald Trump does not get it. He does not see people. The only people he sees are the person he looks in the mirror and sees. He does not see the people. We need a President of the United States who feels, who understands, who is thinking about that father who is at his kitchen table past midnight trying to figure out how he’s going to get through the end of the month when he’s working two jobs and knows he’s missing his son’s ball game. We need somebody that sees that mother who is sitting in the parking lot looking at the sliding glass doors of the Emergency Room and knows that even though she has insurance, if she walks through those sliding glass doors with her sick child, she might be out of pocket more than $4000 for her deductible. We need a President of the United States who has the courage and the power to see and feel and understand that is a sign of strength. See and feel and understand that is a sign of strength. And then through that strength, lift up the people. That is Joe Biden. And I’m going to tell you, on a personal level, I got to know Joe best through his son Beau. So, I was Attorney General of California. And during that time, there was a whole finding about how the big banks had been engaged in predatory lending activities. So many people here in Michigan and around the country lost their homes through that foreclosure crisis. Beau Biden stood with me, even though the state of Delaware had not been hit as hard as so many other states. I got to know Joe through Beau, because you’ve never seen… It’s a rare thing to see such a special relationship between a father and his son. It was an extraordinary relationship they had. And Beau showed courage all the time and conviction. And he spoke with so much love about the father who raised the man that he was. I know Joe. And that’s why I’m supporting him. And my final point, then, is this. Michigan, justice is on the ballot in 2020. Justice is on the ballot. Economic justice is on the ballot in 2020. Reproductive justice is on the ballot in 2020. Healthcare justice is on the ballot in 2020. Environmental justice is on the ballot in 2020. Racial justice is on the ballot in 2020. And Joe Biden is on the ballot in 2020. Thank you. It’s good to see you all. Hello, Detroit! Thank you all for coming out tonight. I can’t tell you how much I appreciate it. [crosstalk 01:04:05] What? [crosstalk 01:04:08] Governor, thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you for your support. Your willingness not only to support me, but to serve as one of our national co-chairs, has sent a powerful message all over Michigan and beyond Michigan. So Governor, when I hear that great line you say, “Just fix the damn roads,” well, let’s just fix the country! Because we can do that. You know, just over a week ago, the press and the pundits had declared this campaign dead. Then South Carolina spoke. Then Super Tuesday spoke. And the turnout was incredible. And now tomorrow, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, Idaho, Washington State, you will be heard. And Michigan, I’m counting on you in a big way. You know, Senator Sanders, as his mother would say, God bless him, likes to say we’re only going to beat Donald Trump by generating excitement and turnout. Well, guess what? On Super Tuesday, we turned out 70% more voters than ever voted there! Guess what? They voted for us. North Carolina, 19% more voters. Texas, 40% more voters. I can go on. Folks, look. He’s right. We’re going to turn out. We’re going to turn out a Democratic Party, and we’re going to turn out a party that is supported by the backbone of this country. Look, the fact is that this movement we started and all of you are part of is generating an incredible amount of motion around the country. Folks, we can’t create a movement without there being empowered by being people who have been the base of the Democratic Party. That’s all right. Let him go. It’s not a Trump rally. It’s not a Trump rally. Let him go. Let him go. Let him go. The Bernie bros are here. Let him go. Folks, folks, let him go. That’s okay. That’s okay. That’s okay. Let him go. Let him go. This is not a Trump rally. [crosstalk 01:07:25] See, folks. Folks. Folks. Folks. Folks. Folks. Look, this is what’s wrong with American politics. [crosstalk 01:08:36] Let them go. Folks. Look, I’m not worried about it. It’s just a reflection of what’s wrong with American politics today. Look. Folks. I’m sorry. I’m sorry. Folks. This is one of the things that Donald Trump has generated. This is not who we are. This is not who we are as a party. It’s not who we are as a people. We got a lot of crazy folks around. Look, every person. I’m sorry, folks. I know. Well, look. Every person that has been knocked down, counted out, left behind, this is your campaign. We need you. We need you. We want you. We want you to be part of our campaign. So join us. Go to joebiden.com. Sign up, volunteer, contribute if you can. But we need you battling. We have to unite this country. Folks, if you want a nominee who will not only beat Donald Trump but keep the House of Representatives as… [crosstalk 01:10:43] Folks. Folks, look. If you want a nominee who’s going to beat Donald Trump, keep the House of Representatives, win back the United States Senate, join us. If you want a nominee who’s a Democrat, a lifelong Democrat, a proud Democrat, an Obama Biden Democrat, join us. If you want a nominee who will bring the party together and not tear it apart, join us. We’re building on a coalition of the most successful president of our lifetime, Barack Obama. And we’re going to do it. We’re going to do this by bringing America together, bringing together America together. Every ethnicity, every race, every gender, every economic station. Folks, look. We are going to unite Democrats, Republicans, independents of every stripe. That’s what the nation needs. We’ve got to bring the country together. Folks. And that’s going to matter here in Michigan because this is a state we have to win in November. I spent a lot of time when I was vice president here with your incredible leader in this town, Mayor Duggan. Mayor Duggan is a hell of a guy. He knows what he’s doing. And I can tell you, we worked side by side fighting to support this city. Matter of fact, the president asked me, he said, “I wanted you to help Detroit, but I didn’t expect you to go live there.” But folks, look. I’ve always believed in Detroit, just like I’ve always believed in Michigan. During the Obama Biden administration, we launched the Great Lakes restoration project. We invested $2.5 billion to help mitigate pollution, protected endangered species, habitats throughout the region. The biggest investment in the Great Lakes in decades. And it’s delivering incredible results. Revitalization of the water point, of the waterfront all across the Great Lakes. And ladies and gentlemen, we’re drawing in new businesses. Resurgences of tourism and activities, like fishing and boating on the lakes. Folks, you are the greatest source of fresh water in all the world. So look. I’ve got a long history of not just talking about what I do, but actually delivering for Michigan. And I’m so proud, so proud of the campaign of so many Michiganers who have joined us, from Lieutenant Governor Gilchrist, an incredible and dynamic young politician whose height is only exceeded by his character and his political prospects. And yes, the incredible women leaders you elected, from Brenda Lawrence to Haley Stevens to Elissa Slotkin, who used to work for us in the administration. There are some amazing women who helped win the House in 2018, and we’re going to make sure they’re going to be reelected. It’s important you reelect every one of these women. Folks, I think we’ve been delivered to a moment where we can not only defeat Donald Trump, but we also have an enormous opportunity. If we think big enough and bold enough to build a future this nation needs and deserves, making healthcare affordable, affordable and accountable, ladies and gentlemen, by making it accessible for every single American, lowering drug prices, ensuring no surprise billings, protecting rural hospitals that are closing because they can’t live on just Medicare reimbursement. We should be building on Obamacare, not scrapping it. Investing billions of dollars to find cures for cancer, Alzheimer’s, and diabetes. Standing up and beating the NRA and the gun manufacturers. I’ve done it before, and I’ve beat them nationally, and I will do it again. Leading the world to deal with the existential threat to our time, and that is climate change. I was part of putting together the Paris Climate Accord. And I want to tell you, the first thing I will do on day one is rejoin that accord. And some of the major polluters so the United States of America can say, it’s time to up the ante. We have to up the ante. We’re 15% of the world’s problem. We will get to net zero emissions. But the rest of the world, if they don’t, it won’t matter. So, ladies and gentlemen, we have to demand the whole world come with us. Ensuring the quality of public education so it doesn’t depend on your zip code. Ladies and gentlemen, there’s no need for us to leave anybody behind. By tripling the amount of money, what they call for Title I schools, schools that are underfunded, we can pay teachers the salaries they need to stay. We’re already short 150,000 teachers today. If we don’t do something quickly to make their salaries competitive and compatible, what’s going to be happen? We’re going to be done 2.5 million… excuse me, 300,000 teachers by the time we get to 2025. Look, ladies and gentlemen, making sure if we do this, we can send every three, four, and five-year-old to school, not to daycare. And when we do that, all the studies show at the great universities in this state and around the country, that it increases exponentially their prospects of going on and going all the way through school and going beyond school. Ladies and gentlemen, reducing student debt. Reducing it because it’s an incredible burden. Paying all those who engaged in public service, including teaching, get up to a $50,000 reduction in their teaching, in their student debt. Folks, that’s who we are. That’s who we have to be. America’s leadership around the world has to change. This is a president of the United States who’s embraced every thug and dictator in the world. Poked his finger in the eyes of our allies. Not a joke, from Putin to Kim Jong Un. Ladies and gentlemen, we’ve got to repair our alliances. I met every major world leader in the last 40 years because of the nature of my job in the United States Congress and vice president. I don’t know a single solitary one who wouldn’t trade places with the United States if they could. But guess what? This president is treating NATO like it’s a protection racket. We’ll honor our commitment to NATO if you pay me more money. Look what’s happening in Asia. We’re in real trouble. Ladies and gentlemen, we have to bring the world back together as well. They need us. Folks, we have to make clear to our allies we can be trusted again, because we’ve lost the trust of so many of our allies around the world. Ladies and gentlemen, we have to also build an economy that rewards work, not just wealth, because let’s get something straight. Wall Street didn’t build America. You built America. The middle class built America. And unions built the middle class. Unions built the middle class. So folks, my dad used to have an expression. He said, ” Joe, your job’s about a lot more than a paycheck.” And I really would say this. A lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about your place in the community. About your sense of your own self-worth. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, “Honey, it’s going to be okay.” Think of all the people you know in your old neighborhoods who don’t think they can say that to the kids today. The middle class is getting crushed. The working poor are getting poorer and poorer with little way up. Folks, we have to rebuild. We have to rebuild the middle class, the backbone of this country. Ladies and gentlemen, the fact of the matter is that we’re in a situation where it’s all about decency, and dignity, and giving people a sense of who they are. Folks, that’s why I’m a Democrat. That’s why I became a Democrat. This election isn’t a battle for the soul of the Democratic Party. It’s a battle for the soul of America. Folks, look. I thought, when those folks came out of those fields carrying torches down in Charlottesville, close your eyes. Picture what it was like, when you saw on television, their veins bulging and screeching anger and hate, chanting the same anti-Semitic bile that was chanted on the streets of Germany in the ’30s, accompanied by the Ku Klux Klan, carrying Nazi flags. I wrote an article for the Atlantic saying that we’re in a battle for the soul of America. And we really are in a battle for the soul of America. And folks, in this most perilous moment, winning means having to unite the country. You can’t define for me who an American is based on ethnicity, based on gender, based on race, based on national origin. You can’t do it. We’re unique. We’re an idea, the most unique idea in all of history. We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men and women are created equal. And we the people, in order to form a more perfect union. No other country has ever been founded on an idea, and we are. And this president, this president is trashing that idea, the way he divides us, the way he is using us to sow division and anger. And folks, a lot of my colleagues say the instinct is we just got to fight back and be as angry as they are. But presidents not only have to know how to fight. They have to know how to heal. They have to know how to heal. And folks, we not only have to beat Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans who are aiding and abetting him, but we can’t become like them. We cannot become like them. I refuse to accept the notion that we’re in a perpetual state of war with the other party. I refuse to accept the notion that in fact the only way we can get something done is by crushing the other team. Folks, we can’t get much done if we do that. We have to be ready to heal. And we can’t become like them. We have to heal our divisions, or else our democracy is going to be in real jeopardy beyond what it is now. Look, our children are listening. And our silence is complicity. Just look how Donald Trump talks, the way he treats people, the way he demeans and demonizes people, the way he ridicules people with infirmities. We haven’t ever had a president like this, really and truly. Never. He has a corrosive effect on this country and on our children. On our children. The Washington Post reported in a long article, they said that we’re already seeing the reports in schools of kids mimicking the behavior of the president. That’s the phrase. Mimicking the behavior of the president. Bullying other kids. Using the same kind of language Trump uses. Singling out immigrants for ridicule and harassment. What did we expect? Because our children are listening. What did we expect? What did we think was going to happen with this man in the White House? When teachers try to deal with this kind of behavior, is it any surprise that kids would say, this is a report of a study done by the Washington Post? Well, the president does it. Look, the words a president utters matters, no matter who the president is. They’re either good or for bad. And the words he utters have had a corrosive effect for real. And look, folks. I’ve said it many times in this campaign. We’re going to be able to overcome four years of Donald Trump with a little bit of luck. And we’re going to make sure that our kids read about it 10 years from now in this high school as an aberration in history. But if we give him eight years, he’ll fundamentally change the nature of who we are in a fundamental way. Folks, the world is watching. The world is watching. They’re looking at us and saying, what in God’s name is going on in America? As I said, he’s embraced our enemies, walked away from our closest allies, and we’ve got to change that. The whole world knows. So they know once again, the United States can be trusted. That’s a critical ingredient for our security and the economic as well as political security. Folks, future generations are watching. And in the years to come, they’re going to look back. They’re going to look back at this moment. And they’re going to say, when it mattered most, what did they do? What did they do? Did they save our democracy, or were they part of the problem? And now at this moment, when there’s so much fear in this country, when we have a circumstance where in fact, American leadership is called into question, we need honest, trusted, truthful, reassuring leadership. And look, and that’s what, if I’m given the honor of being president, I promise you I will provide to the nation. So folks, it’s time for America to get back up and once again fight for the proposition that we hold these truths self-evident, that fight for the notion that America has to lead the world and lead Americans to this new place, this new generation. Look, I view myself as a bridge, not as anything else. There’s an entire generation of leaders you saw stand behind me. They are the future of this country. Look, when I announced my candidacy in Philadelphia and I said that I wanted to do it in Philadelphia, where the Declaration and where the Constitution were first unveiled and unfurled, I said I wanted to do it because, although we’ve never lived up to those aspirations, we’ve never before walked away from them. We’ve never before walked away from them. And folks, I believe with every fiber in my being that we have the capacity, every single generation, save this president, every single president has moved that arc of inclusion wider and wider and wider and wider. We can’t let it shut down. The days of Donald Trump’s divisiveness are soon going to be over. And when he’s gone, when he’s gone, we’ll come back. We’ll get back on the road of building that more perfect union. We’re only a little over a week from St. Patrick’s Day. So it’s only appropriate that I quote an Irish poet I admire, Seamus Heaney. He just passed away. He wrote a poem called “The Cure at Troy.” And there’s a stanza in that poem that goes like this. He says, “History teaches us not to hope on this side of the grave / but then, once in a lifetime, that longed-for tidal wave of justice rises up / and hope and history rhyme. Folks, we’ve got to remember who we are. This is the United States of America! Folks, there’s nothing we’ve ever failed to do when we set our mind to it. Everybody knows who Donald Trump is. Let’s him know who we are. We choose hope over fear. We, Americans, choose unity over division! We Democrats choose science over fiction! And we choose truth over lies! So get up! Let’s take this back now! There’s nothing we can’t do! God bless you all, and may God protect our truth. We can do this. So get up! Take it back! It’s time! It’s time! It’s time! Thank you.

"39","03-11-21"," Good evening, my fellow Americans. Tonight, I’d like to talk to you about where we are as we mark one year since everything stopped because of this pandemic. A year ago, we were hit with a virus that was met with silence and spread unchecked. Denials for days, weeks, then months that led to more deaths, more infections, more stress and more loneliness. Photos and videos from 2019 feel like they were taken in another era, the last vacation, the last birthday with friends, the last holiday with extended family. While it was different for everyone, we all lost something. A collective suffering, a collective sacrifice, a year filled with the loss of life and the loss of living for all of us. But in the loss, we saw how much there was to gain in appreciation, respect, and gratitude. Finding light in the darkness is a very American thing to do. In fact, it may be the most American thing we do, and that’s what we’ve done. We’ve seen frontline and essential workers risking their lives, sometimes losing them, to save and help others. Researchers and scientists racing for a vaccine. And so many of you, as Hemingway wrote, being strong in all the broken places. I know it’s been hard. I truly know. So I’ve told you before, I carry a card in my pocket with the number of Americans who have died from COVID to date. It’s on the back of my schedule. As of now, total deaths in America, 527,726. That’s more deaths than in World War I, World War II, the Vietnam war and 9/11 combined. They were husbands, wives, sons, and daughters, grandparents, friends, neighbors, young and old. They leave behind loved ones, unable to truly grieve or to heal even to have a funeral. But I’m also thinking about everyone else who lost this past year to natural causes, by cruel fate of accident or other disease. They too died alone. They too leave behind loved ones for hurting badly. You’ve often heard me say before I talk about the longest walk any parent can make is up a short flight of stairs to his child’s bedroom to say, “I’m sorry, I lost my job. Can’t be here anymore.” Like my dad told me when he lost his job in Scranton. So many of you have had to make that same walk this past year, you lost your job. You closed your business, facing eviction, homelessness, hunger, a loss of control. Maybe worst of all, a loss of hope. Watching a generation of children who may be set back up to a year or more because they’ve not been in school because of their loss of learning. It’s the details of life that matter the most, and we miss those details. The big details in the small moments. Weddings, birthdays, graduations, all the things that needed to happen, but didn’t. The first date, the family reunions, the Sunday night rituals, it’s all has exacted a terrible cost on the psyche of so many of us. For we are fundamentally a people who want to be with others, to talk, to laugh, to hug, to hold one another, but this virus has kept us apart. Grandparents haven’t seen their children or grandchildren. Parents haven’t seen their kids. Kids haven’t seen their friends. The things we used to do that always filled us with joy have become things we couldn’t do and broke our hearts. Too often we’ve turned against one another. A mask, the easiest thing to do to save lives. Sometimes it divides us. States pitted against one another instead of working with each other. Vicious hate crimes against Asian-Americans, who’ve been attacked, harassed, blamed, and scapegoated. At this very moment, so many of them are fellow Americans. They’re on the front lines of this pandemic trying to save lives and still they’re forced to live in fear for their lives just walking down streets in America. It’s wrong, it’s un-American and it must stop. Look, we know what we need to do to beat this virus. Tell the truth, follow the scientists and the science. Work together, put trust and faith in our government to fulfill its most important function, which is protecting the American people, no function more important. We need to remember the government isn’t some foreign force in a distant capital. No, it’s us, all of us, we the people. For you and I, that America thrives when we give our hearts, when we turn our hands to common purpose. And right now my friends, we’re doing just that. And I have to say, as your president, I’m grateful to you. Last summer, I was in Philadelphia and I met a small business owner, a woman. I asked her, I said, “What do you need most?” Never forget what she said to me. She said, looking me right in the eyes, she said, “I just want the truth, the truth. Just tell me the truth.” Think of that. My fellow Americans, you’re owed nothing less than the truth. And for all of you asking when things will get back to normal, here is the truth. The only way to get our lives back, to get our economy back on track is to beat the virus. You’ve been hearing me say that while I was running. And the last 50 days I’ve been president, but this is one of the most complex operations we’ve ever undertaken as a nation in a long time. That’s why I’m using every power I have as president of the United States to put us on a war footing to get the job done. Sounds like hyperbole, but I mean it, a war footing. And thank God we’re making some real progress now. In my first full day in office, I outlined for you a comprehensive strategy to beat this pandemic. We spent every day since attempting to carry it out. Two months ago, this country didn’t have nearly enough vaccine supply to vaccinate all or ever near all of the American public, but soon we will. We’ve been working with vaccine manufacturers, Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, to manufacture and purchase hundreds of millions doses of these three safe, effective vaccines. And now, at the direction and with the assistance of my administration, Johnson & Johnson is working together with a competitor, Merck, to speed up and increase the capacity to manufacture new Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which is one shot. In fact, just yesterday I announced, and I met with the CEOs of both companies, I announced our plan to buy an additional 100 million doses of Johnson & Johnson vaccines. These two companies, competitors, have come together for the good of the nation, and they should be applauded for it. It’s truly a national effort, just like we saw during World War II. Now, because all the work we’ve done we’ll have enough vaccine supply for all adults in America by the end of May. That’s months ahead of schedule, and we’re mobilizing thousands of vaccinators to put the vaccine in one’s arm. Calling active duty military, FEMA, retired doctors and nurses, administrators, and in those to administer the shots. And we’ve been creating more places to get the shots. We’ve made it possible for you to get a vaccine at nearly any one of 10,000 pharmacies across the country, just like you get your flu shot. We’re also working with governors and mayors in red states and blue states to set up and support nearly 600 federally supported vaccination centers that administered hundreds of thousands of shots per day. You can drive up to a stadium or a large parking lot, get your shot, never leave your car and drive home in less than an hour. We’ve been sending vaccines to hundreds of community health centers all across America located in underserved areas. And we’ve been deploying and we will deploy more mobile vehicles and pop-up clinics to meet you where you live, so those who are least able to get the vaccine are able to get it. We continue to work on making at-home testing available, and we’ve been focused on serving people in the hardest hit communities of this pandemic: Black, Latino, Native American, and rural communities. So what does all this add up to? When I took office 50 days ago, only 8% of Americans, after months, only 8% of those over the age of 65 had gotten their first vaccination. Today, that number is 65%. just 14% of Americans over the age of 75 50 days ago had gotten their first shot. Today, that number is well over 70% with new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the CDC that came out on Monday, it means simply this: millions and millions of grandparents who went months without being able to hug their grandkids can now do so, and the more people are fully vaccinated, the CD will continue to provide additional guidance on what you can do in the workplace, places of worship, with your friends, as well as travel. When I came into office, you may recall I set a goal that many of you said was kind of way over the top. I said I intended to get a hundred million shots in people’s arms in my first a hundred days in office. Tonight, I can say, we’re not going to meet that goal, we’re going to beat that goal because we’re actually on track to reach this goal of a hundred million shots in arms on my 60th day in office. No other country in the world has done that this. None. I want to talk about the next steps for thinking about it. First, tonight, I’m announcing vowel direct all States, tribes, and territories to make all adults people 18 and over eligible to be vaccinated no later than May 1. Let me say that again. All adult Americans will be eligible to get a vaccine no later than May 1. That’s much earlier than expected. Let me be clear. That doesn’t mean everyone’s going to have that shot immediately, but it means you’ll be able to get in line beginning May 1. Every adult will be eligible to get their shot, and to do this, we’re going to go from a million shots a day that I promised in December before I was sworn in to beating our current pace of two million shots a day, outpacing the rest of the world. Secondly, at the time when every adult is eligible in May, we will launch with our partners new tools to make it easier for you to find the vaccine and where to get the shot, including a new website that will help you first find the place to get vaccinated and the one nearest you. No more searching day and night for an appointment for you and your loved ones. Thirdly, with the passage of the American Rescue Plan, and I thank again the House and Senate for passing it, and my announcement last month of a plan to vaccinate teachers and school staff including bus drivers. We can accelerate massive nationwide effort to reopen our schools safely and meet my goal that I stated at the same time, about a hundred million shots, of opening, majority of K through eight schools in my first hundred days in office. This is going to be the number one priority of my new Secretary of Education, Miguel Cardona. Fourth, in the coming weeks, we will issue further guidance on what you can and cannot do once fully vaccinated to lessen the confusion, to keep people safe and encourage more people to get vaccinated. And finally, fifth, and maybe most importantly, I promise I will do everything in my power. I will not relent until we beat this virus, but I need you, the American people. I need you. I need every American to do their part, and that’s not hyperbole. I need you. I need you to get vaccinated when it’s your turn and when you can find an opportunity, and to help your family, your friends, your neighbors get vaccinated as well, because here’s the point. If we do all this, if we do our part, if we do this together, by July the 4th, there’s a good chance. You, your families and friends will be able to get together in your backyard or in your neighborhood and have a cookout and a barbecue and celebrate Independence Day. That doesn’t mean large events with lots of people together, but it does mean small groups will be able to get together. After this long, hard year, that will make this Independence Day something truly special, where we not only mark our independence as a nation, but we began to mark our independence from this virus. But to get there, we can’t let our guard down. This fight is far from over. As I told the woman in Pennsylvania, I’ll tell you the truth. July 4th with your loved ones is the goal, but a goal, a lot can happen. Conditions can change. The scientists have made clear that things may get worse again as new variants of the virus spread. We’ve got work to do to ensure that everyone has confidence in the safety and effectiveness of all three vaccines, so my messaged to you is this. Listen to Dr. Fauci, one of the most distinguished and trusted voices in the world. He’s assured us the vaccines are safe. They underwent rigorous scientific review. I know they’re safe. Vice President Harrison and I know they’re safe. That’s why we got the vaccine publicly in front of cameras for the world to see, so you could see us do it. The First Lady and the Second Gentleman also got vaccinated. Talk to your family, friends, your neighbors, the people you know best who’ve gotten the vaccine. We need everyone to get vaccinated. We need everyone to keep washing their hands, stay socially distanced and keep wearing the mask as recommended by the CDC. Because even if we devote every resource we have, beating this virus and getting back to normal depends on national unity. And national unity isn’t just how politics and politicians vote in Washington and what the loudest voices say on cable or online. Unity is what we do together as fellow Americans, because if we don’t stay vigilant and the conditions change, then we may have to reinstate restrictions to get back on track. Please, we don’t want to do that again. We’ve made so much progress. This is not the time to let up, just as we were emerging from a dark winter into a hopeful spring and summer is not the time to not stick with the rules. I’ll close with this. We’ve lost so much over the last year. We’ve lost family and friends. We’ve lost businesses and dreams we spent years building. We’ve lost time, time with each other. Our children have lost so much time with their friends, time with their schools, no graduation ceremonies this spring, no graduations from college, high school, moving-up ceremonies, and there’s something else we lost. We lost faith in whether our government and our democracy can deliver on really hard things for the American people. But as I stand here tonight, we’re proving once again something I’ve said time and time again, so probably tired of hearing me say it. I said to foreign leaders and domestic alike, “It’s never, ever, a good bet to bet against the American people.” America is coming back. The development, manufacturing, and distribution of vaccines in record time is a true miracle of science. It’s one of the most extraordinary achievements any country has ever accomplished. We also just saw the Perseverance rover land on Mars, stunning images of our dreams that are now reality, another example of the extraordinary American ingenuity, commitment and belief in science and one another. Today I signed into law the American Rescue Plan, an historic piece of legislation that delivers immediate relief to millions of people, includes $1,400 in direct rescue checks, payments. That means a typical family of four earning about $110,000 will get checks for $5,600 deposited if they have direct deposit or in a check, a Treasury check. It extends unemployment benefits. It helps small businesses. It lowers health care premiums for many. It provides food and nutrition, keeps families in their homes, and it will cut child poverty in this country in half, according to the experts. It funds all the steps I’ve just described to beat the virus and create millions of jobs. In the coming weeks and months, I’ll be traveling along with the first lady, the Vice President, the second gentlemen, and members of my cabinet to speak directly to you, to tell you the truth about how the American Rescue Plan meets the moment… if it fails at any [inaudible 00:27:09], I will acknowledge that it failed, but it will not… about how after long, dark years, one whole year, there is hope and light and better days ahead, if we all do our part. This country will be vaccinated soon. Our economy will be on the mend. Our kids will be back in school. We’ll have proven once again that this country can do anything, hard things, big things, important things. Over a year ago, no one could have imagined what we were about to go through, but now, we’re coming through it. It’s a shared experience that binds us together as a nation. We’re bound together by the loss and the pain and the days that have gone by. We’re also bound together by the hope and the possibilities of the days in front of us. My fervent prayer for our country is that after all we’ve been through, we’ll come together as one people, one nation, one America. I believe we can, and we will. We’re seizing this moment, and history, I believe, will record we faced and overcame one of the toughest and darkest periods in this nation’s history, the darkest we’ve ever known. I promise you, we’ll come out stronger with a renewed faith in ourselves, a renewed commitment to one another, to our communities and to our country. This is the United States of America. There’s nothing, nothing, from the bottom of my heart I believe this, there’s nothing we can’t do when we do it together. God bless you all, and please, God, give solace to all those people who lost someone, and may God protect our troops. Thank you for taking the time to listen. I look forward to seeing you."
"40","03-12-20"," This virus, those infected families that have suffered a loss, first responders and healthcare providers are putting themselves on the line as I speak for others. I’d like to thank those who are already making sacrifices to protect us, whether that’s self quarantine, self quarantining themselves or canceling events and closing campuses. Because whether or not you’re infected or know someone who is infected or have been in contact with an infected person, this is going to require a national response. Not just from our elected leaders or our public health officials, but from all of us. We must, all of us follow the guidelines of health officials and take appropriate protections to protect ourselves and critically to protect others, especially those who are most at risk for this disease. It’s going to be making some radical changes in our personal behaviors. More frequent and more thorough hand washing, staying home from work if you’re ill, but also altering the deeply ingrained habits in our country like handshakes and hugs, avoiding any large public gatherings. That’s where earlier this week on the recommendation of officials, my campaign canceled election night rallies that we had planned to hold in Cleveland, Ohio. We’re also re-imagining the format for large crowd events we had planned in Chicago and Miami in the coming days. People, first above everything else. Yesterday, we announced the public health advisory committee of experts who will continue to counsel my campaign and me. Help guide our decisions on the steps to minimize further risks and we also, we will lead by science. The world [inaudible 00:02:06], officially declared COVID-19 a pandemic.[inaudible 00:02:12] Being overly dismissive or [inaudible 00:02:16] is only going to hurt us and further advance the spread of the disease, but neither should we panic or fall back on xenophobia labeling COVID-19 a foreign virus does not displace accountability for the misjudgments that have taken thus far by the Trump administration. Let me be crystal clear. The coronavirus does not have a political affiliation. It will infect Republicans, independents and Democrats alike and will not discriminate based on national origin, race, gender or zip code. It well touch people in positions of power as well as the most vulnerable in our society. And it will not stop, banning all travel from Europe or any other part of the world may slow it, but as we’ve seen it will not stop it. And travel restrictions based on favoritism and politics rather than a risk will be counterproductive. This disease could impact every nation and any person on the planet. We need a plan about how we’re going to aggressively manage here at home. You all do know, the American people have the capacity to meet this moment. We’re going to face this with the same spirit that has guided us in through previous crises and we’ll come together as a nation. We’ll look out for one another and do our part as citizens. We have to harness the ingenuity of our scientists and the resourcefulness of our people and we have to help the world, help the world to drive coordinated global strategy, not shut ourselves off from the world. Protecting the health and safety of the American people is the most important job of any president. And unfortunately this virus laid bear the severe shortcomings of the current administration. Public fears are being compounded by pervasive lack of trust in this president, fueled by adversarial relationships with the truth that he continues to have. Our government’s ability to respond effectively has been undermined by hollowing out our agencies and disparagement of science and our ability to drive a global response is dramatically, dramatically undercut by the damage Trump has done to our credibility and our relationships around the world. We have to get to work immediately to dig ourselves out of this hole. And that’s why today we will combat and overcome the coronavirus. The full details of the plan, if you want to see them go to Joe biden.com where I lay out the immediate steps we have to take to deliver one decisive public health response to curb the spread of the disease and to provide treatment to those who need it, and a decisive economic response that delivers real relief to American workers, families, and small businesses. And protects the economy as a whole are offered as a roadmap, not for what I will do as president 10 months from now, but for the leadership that I believe is needed and required at this very moment. President Trump has welcomed to adopt all of it today. The core principle is simple. Public health professionals must be the ones making our public health decisions and communicating with the American people. Public health professional. It would be a step toward reclaiming public trust and confidence in the United States government as well. Towards stopping the fear and chaos that can overtake communities faster than this pandemic can overtake them. And it’s critical to mount an effective national response that will save lives, protect our frontline health workers, slow the spread of the virus. First. Anyone, anyone who needs to be tested based on medical guidance should be tested at no charge, at no charge. The administration’s failure on testing is colossal and it’s a failure of planning, leadership, and execution. The White House should measure and report each day, each and every day, how many tests have been ordered, how many tests have been completed, and how many have tested positive. By next week, the number of tests should be in the millions, not the thousands. We should make every person in a nursing home available for testing. Every senior center or vulnerable population has to have easy access to the test and we should establish hundreds of mobile testing sites, at least 25 per state and drive through testing centers to speed testing and protect the health of our workers. The CDC, private labs, universities, and manufacturers should be working lock step to get this done and get it done correctly. No effort should be spared. None. No excuses should be made. Tests should be available to all who need them and the government, the government should stop at nothing to make that happen. We must know the true extent of this outbreak so we can map it, trace it and contain it. Nor should we hide, the true number of infections in hope of protecting political interest or the stock market. The markets will respond strong, to strong, steady and capable leadership that addresses the root of the problem, not efforts to cover it up. Secondly, we need to surge our capacity to both prevent and treat the coronavirus and prepare our hospitals to deal with this influx of those needing care as I’ve been saying for weeks. This means not just getting out testing kits and processing them quickly, but making sure communities have the hospital beds available. The staff, the medical supplies, the personal protective equipment necessary to treat the patients. The president should order FEMA to prepare of the capacity with local authorities to establish temporary hospitals with hundreds of beds in short notice. The Department of Defense should be planning now should have been planning to prepare for the potential deployment of the resources provided. Medical facility capacity on logistics support that only they can do. And a week from now, a month from now, we can need an instant 500 bed hospital to isolate and treat patients in any city in this country. We can do that, but we are not ready yet and the clock is ticking. As you take these steps, state, federal and local authorities need to ensure that there’s accurate up to date information available to every American citizen. To everyone so everyone can make an informed decision about when to get tested, when to self quarantine, when to seek medical treatment and the federal government should provide states and municipalities with clear guidance about when to trigger more aggressive mitigation policies such as closing schools. Thirdly, we need to accelerate the development and treatment of a vaccine. Science takes time and it will still be many months before we have a vaccine that can be proven safe for public use and producing sufficient quantities to make a difference. But therapeutics can and should come sooner. This will save lives. When I put together and we passed the Cures Act of 2016 to accelerate work at the National Institute of Health, but now it has to be made available, make available resources to speed up, speed that process along. We have to fast track clinical trials within NIH while closely coordinated with the FDA, the Food and Drug Administration on trial approvals. So the science is not hindered by the bureaucracy and when a vaccine is ready to go. It should also be made widely available and again, free of charge. We should also immediately restore the White House security council directorate for global health security and biodefense with a full time dedicated, coordinated to over see that response. Our administration, our last administration, we created that office to better respond to future global threats after the Ebola crisis of 2014. It was designed for exactly this scenario, but for some reason I still don’t understand President Trump eliminated that office two years ago. Look, here’s the bottom line. We have to do what’s necessary to beat the challenge, beat this challenge sooner rather than later. We will beat it. I assure you, if we wait for it to worsen, then scramble to catch up. The human and economic toll will grow faster, larger and more dangerous. Congress gave this administration $8 billion last week to fight the virus. We need to know exactly what that money is going to be used for. How quickly it’s going out the door, and exactly how it’s being spent. This brings me to the second half of the challenge in terms of economic dislocation that coronavirus is going to cause in our country. We must do whatever it takes, spend whatever it takes to deliver for our families and ensure the stability of our economy. Taking immediate bold measures to help Americans who are hurting economically right this minute. It means we’ll need bigger and broader measures to shore up the economic demand, protect jobs, keep credit flowing to our job creators and make sure we have economic firepower we need to weather the storm and get the people and this economy back to full strength as soon as possible. This crisis will hit everyone, but it’ll hit folks who live paycheck to paycheck the hardest, including working people and seniors. Another tax cut to Google or Goldman or millionaires won’t get the job done. Another tax cut to these folks will not get the job done. Indiscriminate corporate tax subsidies won’t effectively target those who really need the help, now. We need to place our focus on those who are struggling just to get by. People are already losing jobs. We need to replace their wages. That includes workers in the gig economy who lack unemployment insurance. Parents already struggling with childcare costs. We need to give them relief. Children who rely on school lunches, we need to provide food for them. Schools will need to help in ensuring children who don’t have easy access to computers can still learn if their schools shut down. People who have difficulty paying their rent or mortgage because they’ve been laid off or had their hours cut back. We need to help them to stay in their apartments, and their homes. Small businesses will be devastated as customers stay home and adventure canceled. And we need to make sure they have access to interest free loans, not loans with interest, interest free loans. It’s a national disgrace that millions of our fellow citizens don’t have a single day of paid sick leave available to them. You need both a permanent plan for paid sick leave and an emergency plan for everyone who needs it due to the outbreak, now. Beyond these national measures, my plan also calls for the creation of a state local emergency fund to make sure governors, mayors, and local leaders who are battling the coronavirus on the ground as I speak, have the resources necessary to meet this crisis head on, now. These funds can be used at the discretion of local leaders for whatever they need most. From expanding critical health infrastructure, hiring additional healthcare and emergency service personnel or cushioning the wider economic blows this virus is going to create in their communities. We need smart, bold, compassionate leadership that’s going to help contain the crisis, reduce the hardship to our people and help our economy rebound. Let me be very clear. Unfortunately, this will just be a start. We must prepare now to take further decisive action, including relief that will be large in scale focused on broader health and stability of our economy. Look, you can only protect the health or our economy if we do everything in our power to protect the health of our people. The last point I want to make is this, will never fully solve this problem if we’re unwilling to look beyond our own borders and engage fully with the rest of the world. A disease that starts any place in the planet can get on a plane to any city on earth within a few hours. We have to confront a coronavirus everywhere. We should be leading a coordinated global response just as we did to the Ebola crisis. That draws on the incredible capability of the U.S. Agency for International Development and our State Department to assist vulnerable nations in detecting and treating the coronavirus wherever it’s spreading. We should be investing in rebuilding and strengthening the global health security agenda, which we launched during our administration specifically to mobilize the world against the threats of new infectious diseases. Look, it can be hard to see the concrete value of this work when everything seems to be going well in the world. But by cutting our investment in global health, this administration has left us woefully unprepared for the exact crisis we now face. No president can promise to prevent future outbreaks, but I can promise you this. When I’m president, we will be better prepared, respond better and recover better. We’ll lead with science. We’ll listen to the experts. We’ll heed their advice and we’ll build American leadership and rebuild it to rally the world to meet global threats that we are likely to face again. And I’ll always tell you the truth, this is the responsibility of a president. That’s what is owed the American people, now and in difficult days ahead. I know that this country will some of the spirit, the empathy, the decency, and the unity needed. Because in times of crisis, the American people, always, always stand as one if told the truth. Volunteers raise their hands to help, neighbors look out for neighbors. Businesses take care of their workers. So we’ll meet this challenge together. I’m confident of it. We have to move and move now. Thank you all for taking the time to be here and God bless our troops. Thank you. [crosstalk 00:18:13]"
"41","03-15-21"," Over the next 10 days, we’ll reach two goals, two giant goals. The first is 100 million shots in people’s arms will have been completed within the next 10 days and 100 million checks in people’s pockets in the next hundred days. Shots in arms and money in pockets. That’s important. The American Rescue Plan is already doing what it was designed to do: make a difference in people’s everyday lives. We’re just getting started. By the time all the money is distributed, 85% of American households will have gotten their $1,400 rescue checks. To give one more example, for the average family of two parents and two children making a combined income of $110,000 a year, that’s going to add $5,600 for them. $5,600 they’ll get. The plan does a lot more. It extends unemployment insurance for the 11 million Americans unemployed and any who will be unemployed in the near term. It’ll help hundreds of thousands of small businesses keep their doors open, which makes a gigantic difference in neighborhoods and communities. If you have a drug store, if you have a beauty shop, a hardware store, it’s the center of small communities. It gets our schools the resources they need to open safely. It provides the biggest investment in childcare since World War II. It provides food and nutrition help for the millions of families, keep them from going hungry, keeping a roof over their heads. It expands healthcare coverage and lowers healthcare costs for so many people. It will cut child poverty in half in this country. That’s the estimate. Child poverty will be cut in half as a consequence of what’s in this Recovery Act. It will generate economic growth for the entire nation. That’s why major economists, left, right, and center, support this plan. Even Wall Street has agreed. According to Moody’s, by the end of this year, this law will spur our economy to create 7 million new jobs, and does one more thing. It focuses on rebuilding the backbone of this country: working families, the middle-class, the people who built this country. But as I said last week, it’s one thing to pass a historic piece of legislation like the American Rescue Plan, and it’s quite another to implement it. The devil is in the details. It requires fastidious oversight to make sure the relief arrives quickly, equitably, and efficiently with no waste or fraud, in your bank account, in your mailbox, to the local business in your community, and to your child’s school. Look, I’ve been here before. When President Obama and I came to office in 2009, he put me in charge of implementing the Recovery Act, which help us recover and rebuild during the Great Recession. I was authorized to put together a team, including accountability board with inspectors general from different agencies that were effected by the act to make sure we got the roughly $800 billion out, out into the countryside, by the book. And quickly over 18 months. I talked to literally almost over 150 mayors, all governors except one, constantly going over the granular detail of the implementation of that legislation. The effort put us on a path from crisis, to recovery, to resurgence. Accordingly, to the oversight board of inspectors general, they said we got it done with less than two-tenths of 1% waste or fraud. That’s not what the previous administration did though. When the Congress I shared passed the CARES Act, the Congress created a committee of inspectors general to make sure every penny of that money was spent as it was directed. But one of the first things the previous administration did was fire the head of the Inspector General’s Committee. When Congress passed what was intended to be small business relief program, it instead became a free for all for well-connected companies. Mainstream businesses from hardware stores to beauty salons that needed the help most were left behind. 400,000 are now gone. We will not let that happen this time. I learned from my experience implementing the Recovery Act just how important it is to have someone who can manage all the moving parts with efficiency, speed, and integrity, and accountability. That’s the sort of management we’ve seen in our fight against the virus with Jeff Zients, our COVID response coordinator. Today, I’m pleased to announce and introduce another gifted manager to coordinate our implementation of the American Rescue Plan, Gene Sperling. Gene will be on the phone with mayors and governors, red states, blue states, the source of constant communication, a source of guidance and support, and, above all, a source of accountability for all of us to get the job done. Gene’s been here before. The only person in history to serve as director of the National Economic Council, twice. He led successful efforts to deliver relief to small businesses and unemployed Americans in the Obama-Biden administration and in the Clinton administration. I spoke with Gene earlier today, alongside my economic team. He’s ready to get to work. In fact, he’s already hit the ground running. Together, we’re going to make sure that the benefits of the American Rescue Plan go out quickly and directly to the American people where they belong. Let me close with this. Help is here, and hope is here, in real and tangible ways. We’re just days away from a hundred million shots in the arms of millions of Americans. That’s the way. That’s the way on the way to get every single American access to the vaccine. 100 million checks and/or direct deposits going into the pockets of Americans on the way to millions of more Americans. That’s real progress. We’ve a lot more to do. We have to prove to the American people that their government can deliver for them and do it without waste or fraud, that we can vaccinate the nation, that we can get our kids safely back in school, that we can get our economy back on track by helping hundreds of thousands of small businesses open and stay open, and that we can give people of this nation a fighting chance again, with relief checks, lower childcare costs, lower healthcare costs, and so much more. That’s our job. That’s our responsibility. In the process, we’ll be growing the economy as well. We’re going to have to stay on top of every dollar spent through the American Rescue Plan. That’s what we’re going to do. We can do this. We will do this. God bless you all. Help is on the way. May God protect our troops. Thank you very, very much. Mr. President, [inaudible 00:07:51] promote the vaccine among skeptics, sir. Especially to the Republicans who say [inaudible 00:07:56]. I’m hearing a lot of reports from serious reporters like you saying that. I discussed it with my team and they say the thing that has more impact than anything Trump would say to the MAGA folks is what the local doctor, what the local preachers, what the local people in the community say. I urge, I urge all local docs, and ministers, and priests to talk about why, why it’s important to get that vaccine, and even after that, until everyone is in fact vaccinated, to wear this mask. [crosstalk 00:08:39]. Thank you, guys. Thank you. Thank you, guys. Let’s go."
"42","03-16-20"," Welcome to this unique event, the CNN Univision Democratic Presidential Debate with the two leading candidates for the Democratic nomination, former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, candidates. Welcome. It’s good to have you. I’m Jake Tapper, along with CNN’s Dana Bash, and Univision’s Ilia Calderón. We come together tonight at an extraordinary time in our country when people are worried about far more than just presidential politics. We’re in a national emergency because of the devastating global pandemic of coronavirus. It has killed nearly 6,000 [inaudible 00:00:34] and more than 3,300 known cases here in the United States. As a result, tonight’s debate will focus heavily on the crisis. The setting of this debate is also different. To reduce unnecessary risk of transmission of the virus, CNN, Univision, the Democratic National Committee, and the campaigns moved this debate from Phoenix, Arizona to here at CNN studios in Washington without any audience. All of this comes of course as four more states, Florida, Arizona, Ohio, and Illinois prepare to vote on Tuesday, with Vice President Biden currently leading Senator Sanders in the race for delegates. Here’s what we’re going to do tonight. Each of you will have 90 seconds to answer questions, and 45 seconds for responses and rebuttals. As much as we can, we hope this will be a conversation between the two of you, so let’s begin with the most important issue right now, the coronavirus, and what you would do as president in the face of it. Vice President Biden, let me start with you. We’re in a reality right now that might’ve seemed unimaginable a week ago. Schools have been canceled for more than 25 million students. Grocery store shelves have been cleared out. March Madness, NBA games, Disney parks, Broadway, small businesses, all shut down, and just today the CDC issued a new recommendation that for the next eight weeks, events that consist of 50 people or more throughout the US be canceled or postponed. First of all, my heart goes out to those who have already lost someone, or those who are suffering from the virus, and this is bigger than any one of us. This calls for a national rallying to everybody move together, and I laid out in detail what I would do were I president today. You can go to joebiden.com. I laid it out in significant detail, but there are three pieces of this. First of all, have to take care of those who in fact are exposed, or are likely to be exposed to the virus, and that means we have to do testing. We have to get the testing kits up and ready. I would have the World Health Organization, I’d take advantage of the test kits they have available to us, even though the president says a million or more are coming, let’s just get all the tests we can done as quickly as we can. Secondly, I would make sure that every state in the union had at least 10 places where they had drive-through testing arrangements. I would also at this point deal with the need to begin to plan for the need for additional hospital beds. We have that capacity in the Department of Defense as well as with the FEMA, and they can set up hundred-bed, 500-bed hospitals and tents quickly. We have to lay all that out, but we have to deal with the economic fallout quickly, and that means making sure that people who in fact lose their job, don’t get a paycheck, can’t pay their mortgage, are able to pay it, and pay them now, and do it now. Small businesses be able to borrow interest-free loans. I see my time is up here. You’re going to hold us tightly, I assume, but that’s what I would do. Go to joebiden.com. It lays out precisely what I would do were I president today. Senator Sanders, this morning, Dr. Anthony Fauci acknowledged that it’s possible that hundreds of thousands, if not millions of Americans, could die of coronavirus in a worst-case scenario. Well, first thing we have got to do, whether or not I’m president, is to shut this president up right now, because he is undermining the doctors and the scientists who are trying to help the American people. It is unacceptable for him to be blabbering with unfactual information which is confusing the general public. Second of all, what we need to do, and I’m glad that he has called a state of national emergency. What we have got to do is move aggressively to make sure that every person in this country finally understands that when they get sick with the coronavirus that all payments will be made, that they don’t have to worry about coming up with money for testing. They don’t have to worry about coming up with money for treatment. This is an unprecedented moment in American history. Now, I obviously believe in Medicare for all. I will fight for that as president, but right now in this emergency, I want every person in this country to understand that when you get sick, you go to the doctor. When you get sick, if you have the virus, that will be paid for. Do not worry about the cost right now, because we’re in the middle of a national emergency. Second of all, we have to make sure that our hospitals have the ventilators that they need, have the IC units that they need. Right now, we have a lack of medical personnel, and I worry very much that if there is a peak, whether we have the capability of dealing with the hundreds of thousands of people who may be in hospitals, so we need unprecedented action right now to deal with the unprecedented crisis. Bottom line from an economic point of view, what we have got to say to the American people, if you lose your job, you will be made whole. You’re not going to lose income. Thank you, Senator. … we can protect the wages of every worker in America. Thank you, Senator. Vice President Biden, President Trump says he does not take any responsibility for the problems with coronavirus testing, in part because he says he inherited so many rules, regulations, and red tape. No. Look, the World Health Organization offered, offered the testing kits that they have available and to give it to us now. We refused them. We did not want to buy them. We did not want to get them from them. We wanted to make sure we had our own. I think he said something like, “We have the best scientists in America,” or something to that effect. The idea that we are not prepared for this and not … The other thing I want to point out, and I agree with Bernie, we’re in a situation where we have to now be providing for the hospitals that are going to be needed, needed now. The present system cannot handle the surge that is likely to come, so we should already be sitting down and planning where we’re going to put these temporary hospitals, and we can do that. We did that … We’ve been through this before with the coronavirus. We’ve been through this … I mean, excuse me, we’ve been through this before with dealing with the viruses that the N1H1 as well as what happened in Africa. We provided these hospitals dealing with these great pandemics, and were able to do it quickly, and people would have a place to go, but we also have to provide the equipment to protect the first responders, and that’s not being done either. Senator Sanders, on that note, and both of you have addressed this, but obviously another major health concern right now for officials is the potential surge in patients all at once, overburdening hospitals, the healthcare system. You’ve mentioned ICU beds, both of you, and ventilators. We’re already in the middle of flu season, so already a lot of those beds and ventilators are already being used. Jake, let’s be honest and understand that this coronavirus pandemic exposes the incredible weakness and dysfunctionality of our current healthcare system. Now, we’re spending twice as much per person on healthcare as the people of any other country. How in God’s name does it happen that we end up with 87 million people who are uninsured or underinsured and there are people who are watching this program tonight, and say, “I’m not feeling well. Should I go to the doctor? But I can’t afford to go to the doctor. What happens if I am sick? It’s going to cost thousands of dollars for treatment. Who’s going to feed my kids?” We are the only major country on earth not to guarantee healthcare to all people. We’re spending so much money, and yet we are not even prepared for this pandemic. How come we don’t have enough doctors? How come hospitals in rural areas are shutting down? How come people can’t afford to get the prescription drugs they need, because we have a bunch of crooks who are running the pharmaceutical industry, ripping us off every single day, and I’ll tell you something right now, in the midst of this epidemic, you’ve got people in the pharmaceutical industry who are saying, “Oh wow, what an opportunity to make a fortune.” So the word has got to go out. I certainly would do this as president. You don’t worry, people of America, do not worry about the cost of prescription drugs. Do not worry about the cost of the healthcare that you’re going to get, because we are a nation, a civilized democratic society. Everybody, rich and poor, middle-class, will get the care they need. The drug companies will not rip us off. Thank you, Senator. Vice President Biden, some medical experts are saying the only true way to control this virus is through a national quarantine, requiring every American other than essential personnel to stay home. What I would do is what we did in our administration. I would call a meeting in The Situation Room of all the experts in America dealing with this crisis. I would sit them down, and I would do exactly what we did then. What is it that we need? Listen to the experts. What do we need? With all due respect to Medicare for all, you have a single-payer system in Italy. It doesn’t work there. It has nothing to do with Medicare for all. That would not solve the problem at all. We can take care of that right now by making sure that no one has to pay for treatment, period, because of the crisis. No one has to pay for whatever drugs are needed, period, because of the crisis. No one has to pay for hospitalization because of the crisis, period. That is a national emergency, and that’s how it’s handled. It is not working in Italy right now, and they have a single-payer system. Now, with regard to what else I would do, the fact is that we’re in a position where I would bring together the leading experts in the world, instead of doing this, in the United States, instead of doing this piecemeal, sit down and do what we did before with the Ebola crisis. What is needed? And have one voice, one voice, like we did every day we met on that crisis in The Situation Room, so we lay out overall, for all the nation, what the best proposal is and how to move forward. In the absence of that, governors are making some sound decisions. Thank you. … and we beat it. Thank you. Well, first of all, the dysfunctionality of the current healthcare system is obviously apparent. As I said earlier, there are people who hesitate go to the doctor. You’re going to have the maze of regulations. Well, if this is my income, but that’s my income, can I get it? Can I not get it? Clearly we are not prepared, and Trump only exacerbates the crisis. When we spend twice as much per capita on healthcare as any other nation, one might expect that we would have enough doctors all over this country. One might expect that we would have affordable prescription drugs. One might expect that we were preparing effectively for a pandemic, that we were ready with the ventilators, with the ICUs, with the test kits that we need. We are not, and bottom line here is in terms of Medicare for all, despite what the vice president is saying, what the experts tell us, is that one of the reasons that we are unprepared and have been unprepared is we don’t have a system. We got thousands of private insurance plans. That is not a system that is prepared to provide healthcare to all people. In a good year without the epidemic, we’re losing up to 60,000 people who die every year because they don’t get to a doctor on time. It’s clearly this crisis is only making a bad situation worse. That has nothing to do when you’re in a national crisis. The national crisis says we’re responding. It’s all free. You don’t have to pay for a thing. That has nothing to do with whether or not you have an insurance policy. This is a crisis. We’re at war with the virus. We’re at war with the virus. It has nothing to do with copays or anything. We just pass a law saying that you do not have to pay for any of this, period. That’s not true. As a matter of fact, that’s not true. That law has enormous loopholes. I understand that Nancy Pelosi did her best. Republicans prevented it. What you’re talking about, Joe, here, is enormous loopholes within that, that in fact it is not necessarily covering treatment for all people in America, and that people are going to be stuck with a bill unless we change that, and we’re going to offer legislation to in fact change that. If I may, I offered legislation. I laid out on my plan that it would cover exactly what is not covered by the house. I laid out in the plan that I laid out for how we would deal with this crisis. Nobody, nobody will pay for anything having to do with the crisis. This is a national emergency. There isn’t a question of whether or not this is something that could be covered by insurance, or anything else. We, out of the treasury, are going to pay for this. It’s a national emergency. That’s what my plan calls for. But the weakness of this is, let’s just do a hypothetical. A family member’s diagnosed with the virus. Yep. Terrible tragedy, massive anxiety. The wife has the virus. The husband is a wreck, wants to go to a psychologist, wants to get counseling, doesn’t have the money to do that. Maybe their kid breaks a leg. They don’t have the money to go to healthcare. So you’re saying right now in the middle of a crisis, but you know what? Last year at least 30,000 people died in America because they didn’t get healthcare when they should, because we don’t have universal coverage. I think that’s a crisis. One out of five people in America cannot afford the prescription drugs they need. They suffer. Some die. I consider that a crisis. Bottom line is we need a simple system, which exists in Canada, exists in countries all over the world, and that is if you are an American, you get the healthcare you need, end of discussion. We can save huge sums of money doing that. The trick is, do we have the guts to take on the healthcare industry, some of which is funding the vice president’s campaign. Thank you, Senator. … some of whom are funding his campaign. Vice President Biden. Look, this is a national crisis. I don’t want to get this into a back and forth in terms of our politics here. I’ve laid out a plan building on Obamacare, providing a public option of Medicare, that would cover everyone the same way. This idea that this is his only answer is a mistaken notion, but regardless of whether my plan was in place or his, this is a crisis. This is like we are being attacked from abroad. This is something that is of great consequence. This is like a war, and in a war you do whatever is needed to be done to take care of your people, and what you do is you, and I have proposed it, and laid it out in detail, everything that you need in terms of dealing with this crisis would be free. It is paid for by the taxpayers generally, generally. It has nothing to do with Bernie’s Medicare for all. Vice President Biden, thank you. If I may, the vice president had just mentioned war. Well, I think we use all of the tools that make sense. If using the National Guard, which is, folks I think in New York state are already using the National Guard, that is something that has to be done. This is clearly, as the vice president indicated, a national emergency. What I worry about is not only how we respond aggressively to the virus, but also how we respond aggressively to the economic fallout of a global recession. Right now in Illinois and Ohio, if my memory is correct, the governor there has said they’re closing down bars. They’re closing down restaurants. What happens to the workers who are there? What happens to the millions of workers who may end up losing their jobs? What I think we have got to do right now is if Trump can provide, or the fed can provide a trillion and a half for liquidity for the banks, what we’ve got to say to every worker in America, you know what? Don’t panic. You’re not going to … You’ll be able to pay your mortgage, because you’re going to get a check. You’re going to be made whole. Senator, we’re going to talk about the economic … Oh, go ahead, Mr. Vice President. The answer is I would call out the military. Okay. Now. They have the capacity to provide this surge help that hospitals need and that is needed across the nation. I would make sure that they did exactly what they’re prepared to do. They’ve done it. They did it in the Ebola crisis. They’ve done it. They have the capacity to build 500-bed hospitals, and tents that are completely safe and secure, and provide the help to get it done to anybody, this overflow. So it is a national emergency. I would call out the military. Well, the Ebola crisis is one thing. This is obviously a pandemic which is far more severe and impactful to this country. I think one of the things that we want to remember here is that we got a lot of elderly people in this country who are told, stay home. Don’t leave your house. Who’s going to get food to them? How do we get food to them? You’ve got schools all over this country now being shut down. Okay. I think what bottom line here is that in this crisis, we have got to start paying attention to the most vulnerable, that includes people who are in prison right now, people who are in homeless shelters right now. What about the half a million people who are homeless tonight? Who’s going to respond to them? Now, in 2008 when we had the Wall Street bailout, they did very well for the people on top. They bailed out the crooks on Wall Street, but they forgot about the suffering of ordinary Americans. This time around, let us learn that lesson. Let us pay attention to the working families in this country. Thank you, Senator. We have the most vulnerable. We have learned that lesson, and again, I lay out in detail. What we should be doing now is we should be surging help to those places which are the most vulnerable. We should have every single person that’s in a nursing home being able to be tested. We should be moving forces in to do that. We should move in the capability to do that. We should be sitting down, the president should be sitting down in The Situation Room right now and doing what we did before, and asking the question, “Okay, you’re going to close everything. Well, if you close everything, how do you get prescriptions that have to be filled? How do you make sure when you close that school those children are going to be able to get the school food program? How do you make sure that you’re going to be able to see to it that you get your mortgage paid?” I propose that all of that be covered, and it’s going to take a multi-multi-billion dollar program to do that. Thank you, Mr. Vice President. We’re going to talk in a moment a lot more about the economic impact, but first, Senator Sanders, I want to ask about China. When this outbreak first started in China, the government there censored the whistleblower doctor who sounded the alarm and downplayed the true gravity of the virus. Right. Well, one of the consequences is we have got to learn that you cannot lie to the American people. You cannot be less than frank about the nature of the crisis. And what bothers me very much is you have a president of the United States today, Mr. Trump, who was praising China, for the good work that they are doing, when in fact, as you indicated, they were lying to their own people and allowing that [inaudible 00:21:02] the case. Look, I don’t think this is the time for recrimination, to be punishing people. Now is the time, by the way, to be working with China. They are learning a lot about this crisis, and in fact, we have got to work with them. We’ve got to work with the World Health Organization. We’ve got to work with Italy. We’ve got to work with countries around the world. If there was ever a moment when the entire world is in this together, got to support each other, this is that moment. If I may respond. That’s why I insisted, the moment this broke out, that we should insist on having our experts in China, in China to see what was happening, and make it clear to China there’d be consequences if we did not have that access. We have to lead the world. We should be the ones doing what we did during the Ebola crisis, bringing the whole world together and saying, “This is what we must do.” We have to have a common plan. All nations are affected the same way by this virus depending on exposure. And so this is, we need world leadership. We need international leadership. We need someone who knows how to bring the world together and insist on fundamental change in the way in which we’re approaching this. Well, the bottom line here is that in the midst of this crisis, we have got to act in an unprecedented way. And that means every country on earth is going to be affected. Every country on earth has got to work together. It also means that we tell the pharmaceutical industry, we tell the big money interests, that this is not a time for profiteering. This is a time for all of us working together. The World Health Organization is a very, very strong organization. It is sad that we have a President that has ignored the international community in so many ways, including in terms of international health crisis. Thank you, Senator Sanders. Obviously, another part of this story is the economy, which is reeling from this pandemic. Many economists are warning of a recession. Just hours ago, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to near 0%, which has not happened since the financial crisis in 2008. What I would do is make it clear to the world and make it clear to the United States that we are going to have to have a major, major, major bailout package that we do not reward corporations, we reward individuals who in fact are really put to the test here. The problem is, the policies of this administration economically have… We’ve eaten a lot of our seed corn here. The ability for us to use levers that were available before have been used up by this godawful tax cut of $1.9 trillion. By the fact that we have used… The fed will be of little consequence now, they’ve already used what leverage they have, and so we’re going to have to just level with the American people. Here’s the deal. We’re going to have to not only deal with the immediate crisis, economic crisis, which is the most critical now to let people know their mortgages are going to be paid, their rents are going to be paid, they’re going to have childcare, they’re going to make sure that all their medical bills are cared for relating to this, et cetera. We have to go beyond that. We’re going to have to be in a situation where we’re meeting on a daily basis, like we did in the middle of the financial crisis, to decide how we are going to find the wherewithal and the money to be able to see to it. We hold all these folks harmless. But not do what Trump wants to do. For example, he came along and said, “I got a great idea. Senator Sanders. The Ebola crisis, in my view, exposes the dysfunctionality of our healthcare system and how poorly prepared we are, despite how much money that we spent. The Ebola crisis is also, I think, exposing the cruelty and the unjustness of our economy today. We have more income and wealth inequality in America today than any time in 100 years. And what that means then, in the midst of this crisis… You know, if you’re a multimillionaire, no one’s happy about this crisis. You’re going to get through it. You’re going to get everything you need. You’re not worried about healthcare. You’re not worried about income coming in. Half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck. We got people who are struggling working two or three jobs to put food on the table. What is going to happen to them? So the lesson to be learned is we have got to move aggressively right now to address the economic crisis as a result of Ebola… Keep talking about Ebola. You got Ebola in my head here right now. As a result of the virus here, the Coronavirus. What we have got to do also is understand the fragility of the economy and how unjust and unfair it is that so few have so much and so many have so little. People are looking for results, not a revolution. They want to deal with the results they need right now, and we can do that by making sure that we make everybody whole who has been so badly hurt in terms of they lose their job, in terms of not having the ability to care for their children, in terms of the healthcare costs that they have related to this crisis. We can make them whole now, now, and put in process a system whereby they all are made whole. That has nothing to do with a legitimate concern about income equality in America. That’s real. That’s real. But that does not affect the need for us to act swiftly and very thoroughly and in concert with all the forces that we need to bring to bear to deal with the crisis now, so no one’s thrown out of their home, no one loses their mortgage, no one is kicked out of their house, no one loses their paycheck, no one is in a position where they have a significant financial disability as a consequence of this SARS… Of this particular crisis. Thank you, Vice President. Senator Sanders. Well, I think it goes without saying that as a nation we have to respond as forcefully as we can to the current crisis, but it is not good enough not to be understanding how we got here and where we want to go into the future. So how does it happen that today, in the wealthiest country in the history of the world, half of our people are scared to death? Good. I agree. In fact, that was my idea originally to make sure that every person in this country is made whole as a result of this crisis. But God willing, this crisis is going to end, and we are going to have to develop an economy in which half of our people are not living paycheck to paycheck and struggling to put food on the table. I don’t disagree with that. You were asking about the crisis, what are we going to do about the crisis now? Which is incredibly consequential to millions and millions of Americans. And it’s not going to be policy now. It’s not going to be solved by a change in how we deal with healthcare. It’s got to be solved with an emergency need right now. Right now, what do we do? First thing we do is we make sure that healthcare is available by us having the tools to be able to deal with it, and that requires us to go out and do much more than this president has done in terms of planning. Secondly, it requires us to be in a position where we’re anticipating what will happen in the next month or weeks in terms of the flow into the healthcare system, by bringing the military along, more hospital beds, more training, more equipment, more equipment to save the first responders, as well. In addition to that, we then have to also look at what are the immediate needs right today? How about that person who’s been laid off today? How about that person who doesn’t have an income today? They have to know that tomorrow, when the paycheck comes due, you will get that paycheck. And thirdly, we have to think longterm about how we deal with making all those who have been badly damaged right again, and then we move on. Then we move on to change the economy in ways that are more profoundly necessary than people think, but do not respond to the immediate needs we have now. First things first. Thank you, Vice President, Senator Sanders, you voted against bailouts following the 2008 financial crisis. Yes. Many believe those spending bills were a crucial part of stabilizing the economy back then. I did. You’re quite right, I voted against the bailout because I believed that the illegal behavior being done by the people on Wall Street should not be rewarded by a bailout. And today, by the way, those banks are more prosperous and own more assets, by and large, than they did back then. They’re bigger now than they were then. I thought at the time that in the midst of massive income and wealth inequality, the people on top… there was surtax on the very wealthy… should bail out. And it’s not just the top bailout. We gave trillions of dollars in zero interest loans to large banks. But to answer your question where we are right now, we need to stabilize the economy, but we can’t repeat what we did in 2008. Joe voted for that. I voted against it. Because we have got to do more than save the banks or the oil companies. Our job right now is to tell every working person in this country, no matter what your income is, you are not going to suffer as a result of this crisis of which you had no control. Vice President Biden. Had those banks all gone under, all those people Bernie says he cares about would be in deep trouble. Deep, deep trouble. All those little folks… we’d have gone out of business… they’d find themselves in the position where they would lose everything that they had in that bank, whether it was $10 or $300 or a savings account. This was about saving an economy, and it did save the economy, and the banks paid back and they paid back with interest. I agree with Bernie, some of them should have gone to jail. That was the big disagreement I had in terms of bailing out, but the question was, they paid back. In addition to that, also part of that was bailing out the automobile industry, saving thousands of jobs, tens of thousands of jobs over time. He voted against that as well. No. I did not vote against that. That bailout money was used later on by Bush to protect the automobile industry. …one minute, one minute. Here’s the point here, is that in terms of that bailout, there are ways that you can bail out. When you have a handful of people who have incredible wealth, who have prospered off of the illegal behavior of individuals, in this case on Wall Street, you know what you say to them? And I did. I said this to the Secretary of the Treasury, “You want a bailout? That’s fine. You have your friends pay for it, not working people.” The other point is, as Joe should know, it wasn’t just the 700 billion TARP program. The fed gave trillions and trillions of dollars in zero interest loans to every financial institution in this country and central banks all over the world. That was essentially a grant, because they then could sell that. They can then bring in interest rates much greater than the zero interest loans that they got. Vice President Biden. Look, the fact of the matter is that if in fact the banks had all gone under, we would be in a great depression. How do you get out of that? Now, Bernie’s saying that I guess he’s going to do a wealth tax or something, that the top 1% could pay for everything and they should pay for everything that occurred. We were talking about tens and hundreds of billions of dollars. That’s what this was about. And the fact was that it saved the economy from going into a depression, after we passed the Recovery Act, which I was the one went on, got the three votes to get it changed, that had $900 billion in it and was the thing that kept us from going into a great depression. Vice President Biden, I’m going to stay with you. Many of the 11 million undocumented immigrants, and now even many legal immigrants in the United States, are afraid to seek medical help. Anyone who shows up to be tested for Coronavirus or gets Coronavirus treated would be held harmless. Just like I’ve argued all along. Any woman who crosses the border or is here and being beaten by her husband, but she’s an undocumented, she cannot be deported because she reports. There are certain things you cannot deport an undocumented person for and that would be one of them. We want that. It’s in the interests of everyone. And those folks who are the xenophobic folks out there, it’s even in their interest that that woman come forward or that man come forward, because it deals with keeping the spread from moving more rapidly. They will not, should not, under any circumstances, be held accountable and be deported for that purpose, period. I have been criticized because the proposal for Medicare for All that I introduced includes making sure that undocumented people are also covered. And right now, we have the absurd situation where undocumented people who try to do the right thing, they’re sick, they want to go to the doctor, they don’t want to spread this disease, are now standing and thinking about whether ICE is going to deport them. So one of the things that we have to do is to make sure that everybody feels comfortable getting the healthcare that they need. That should be a general principle, above and beyond the Coronavirus. Second of all, we’ve got to end these terrible ICE raids which are terrorizing communities all over this country. And thirdly, to answer your question, the time is long overdue for this country to move to comprehensive immigration reform and a path towards citizenship for those 11 million undocumented. And furthermore, on day one as President, I would restore the legal status of the 1. Senator. Senator, thank you. We’re going to talk about immigration in a minute, but first I want to ask about something that’s going on right now. Again, back to this crisis. We know that people over the age of 60 and those with underlying medical conditions, especially heart disease, lung disease and diabetes, are the most vulnerable to Coronavirus and are being asked to change their behavior to protect themselves. So Senator Sanders, I’ll start with you. You’re 78 years old. You had a heart attack. Well, a great deal. I mean, last night we had a fireside chat, not a rally. I love doing rallies and we bring many thousands of people out to our rallies. I enjoy it very much. We’re not doing that right now. In fact, our entire staff is working from home. So on a personal level, what we’re doing is, I’m not shaking hands. Joe and I did not shake hands. I am very careful about the people I am interacting with. I’m using a lot of soap and hand sanitizers to make sure that I do not get the infection. And I have to say, thank God, right now I do not have any symptoms and I feel very grateful for that. Vice President Biden, you’re 77. Well, fortunately, I don’t have any of the underlying conditions you talked about that I have to worry about, number one. Number two, thank God… for the time being, anything can happen, as my mother would say, knock on wood… that I’m in good health. Number three, I’m taking all the precautions anyone would take, whether they’re 30 years old or 60 years old or 80 years old. That is, I’m going to make sure that I do not shake hands any longer. I do not engage. We did the same thing. Our staff is all working from home. We are not doing rallies any longer. We’re doing virtual rallies. We’re doing virtual town hall meetings. We’re in a situation where now, I do not… as I said, when we encounter people, we’re not going into crowds. And so I’m taking all the precautions everyone else should be taking. I wash my hands God knows how many times a day with hot water and soap. I carry with me… as a matter of fact, I have it in my bag outside here… hand sanitizer. I don’t know how many times a day I use that. I make sure I don’t touch my face, and so on. So I’m taking all the precautions we’ve told everybody else to take. Let’s turn to the race more broadly now. Throughout this campaign, you’ve each laid out starkly different visions for how to bring about change. Vice President Biden, Senator Sanders is calling for a political revolution. You said people want results, not a revolution. Make the case for why a revolution is not what the country needs or wants. We have problems we have to solve now. Now. What’s a revolution going to do, disrupt everything in the meantime? Look, the Senator talks about his Medicare For All. He still hasn’t told you how he’s going to ever get it past. He hasn’t told you how in fact there’s any possibility of that happening. He hadn’t told you how much it’s going to cost. He hadn’t tell you how it’s going to apply. It doesn’t kick in for four years, even after it passes. We want a revolution. Let’s act now. Pass the Biden healthcare plan, which takes Obamacare, restores all the cuts made to it. Subsidize it further. Provide for lower drug prices. Make sure that there’s no hidden bills. Make sure that we invest what I want to invest $50 billion in dealing with underlying diseases that are of great consequence, diabetes, Alzheimer’s and cancer. Make sure that we have a Medicare option that’s in a public option providing Medicare for us. We can do that now. I can get that passed. I can get that done if I’m President of the United States of America. That will be a fundamental change and it happens now. I can tell you from experience, being a significant consumer of healthcare with my sons, my family, all the things we’ve gone through, what people want is hope. And they need it now, not four years from now. Bernie still hasn’t told us how he’s going to pay for it. Not quite true. We’re talking about a $30-plus trillion plan. Not quite true. Senator. Look, let’s do something that is very rarely done in the Congress. Let’s do something that the media does. Let’s talk about the reality of American life. The bottom half of America, $900 billion decline in their wealth. Why is it that we are the only major country on Earth not to guarantee healthcare to all people as a human right? Why are we the only major country not to have paid medical and family leave? Why do we give tax breaks to billionaires, when a half-a-million people are homeless today? And it comes down to something, Jake, we don’t talk about. The power structure in America, who has the power? I’ll tell you who has the power. It’s the people who contribute money. The billionaires who contribute money to political campaigns, who control the legislative agenda. Those people have the power. If you want to make real changes in this country, if you want to create an economy that works for all, not just the few… if you want to guarantee quality healthcare to all, not make $100 billion in profit for the healthcare industry, you know what you need? You need to take on Wall Street. You need to take on the drug companies, and the insurance companies, and the fossil fuel industry. You don’t take campaign contributions from them. You take them on and create an economy that works for all. You want to do that? Do what I proposed over 30 years ago, federally fund all elections… My whole healthcare plan, by changing the way in which we deal with capital gains. People should pay their capital gains based on what their income tax is, and not at 20%. That would raise $800 billion to pay for my entire medical healthcare plan which would cover everyone. The fact of the matter is, everything I call for I pay for. And I do not believe and I have not supported these exorbitant tax cuts for the wealthy. I strongly opposed the tax cut that this president has put through of $1 trillion, $900 billion. I said at the time, this was all about trying to eliminate the safety net. Look, the idea that Bernie implies the way he says things, speaking of negative ads… My lord Bernie, you’re running ads saying I’m opposed to Social Security. The PolitiFact says it’s a flat lie, and that the Washington Post said is a flat lie. Oh, well. Let me ask you a question, Joe. Yeah. You’re right here with me. Yeah. Have you been on the floor of the Senate? You were in the Senate for a few years. Yeah. Time and time again talking about the necessity, with pride, about cutting Social Security, cutting Medicare, cutting veterans programs. No. No. All right. America, go to the website right now. Go to the YouTube right now. Time after time, you were not a fan of Bowles-Simpson. You were not a fan of the balanced budget amendment, which called for cuts in Social Security? Come on Joe, you were. Look, here’s the deal. You’re an honest guy. Why don’t you just tell the truth here? We all make mistakes. I am telling the truth. I have laid out how I will increase Social Security benefits. That’s good. I laid that out. I have laid out how I am going to make sure that it is in fact, paid for. Go to joebiden.com. Look at my exchange with Paul Ryan on his desire to try to privatize and/or cut Social Security, and understand how he manipulated it. All right. Joe, let me repeat it again. I want you just to be straight with the American people. I am saying that you have been on the floor of the Senate time and time again, talking about the need to cut Social Security, Medicare, and veterans programs. No, it’s not true. That is not true. What is true is, in terms of the negotiations that are taking place, how to deal with the deficit… Everything was on the table. I did not support any of those cuts, and Social Security or in veterans benefits. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Everything was on the table. All right, you’re right. You just said it. Including in your judgment, cuts to Social Security and veterans. In order to get the kinds of changes we need on other things related., but we did not cut it. I did not vote for it. I know, because people like me helped stop that. Come on, Bernie. Joe, you just contradicted yourself. One minute… Excuse me. One minute you said, “I was not on the floor.” The next minute you say, “Well yes, there was a reason why I was worried about the deficit.” Maybe that’s good reason, maybe it’s not. All that I am saying is you were prepared to cut, and advocated for the cuts of programs. Let’s just… I did not. I never voted to cut Social Security. I’m not talking about voting, Joe. That’s not what I said. I never voted… Well, look. I voted to protect it. Just go look at the debate with Paul Ryan for the vice presidency. Look at what I did. Yeah. Well, believe me, the Washington Post, PolitiFact is wrong a whole lot of times. Joe. Joe, did you… Wait a minute. I’ll answer your question. You answer mine. I answered yours. No, you didn’t. All right. One more time. No, I did not talk about the need to cut any of those programs. Okay. All that I would say to the American people, go to YouTube. It’s all over the place. Joe said it many, many times. I’m surprised. You can defend it or change your mind on it, but you can’t deny the reality. So Senator, because you brought up Social Security and you have been talking about it, I want to ask you about something that you wrote in 1996. You were a member of the House, and you wrote an op ed that said, “It is clear we will have to make incremental adjustments in Social Security, taxes and benefits. Yeah. Incremental adjustments are what I advocated. Adjustments that I advocated and have advocated for years, is among other things, increasing the cost of living assistance. No, you’re not going to find me ever calling for cuts to Social Security. Right now for example, we determine COLAs by looking at inflation for the general population rather than segregating the higher costs that seniors are paying for prescription drugs and for healthcare. That’s what I was talking about. I have in fact, when Joe and others were enamored with the so-called Bowles-Simpson effort, which included cuts to Social Security or raising the retirement age. I formed along with people like Barbara Boxer, the defending Social Security caucus to say no… when 20% of our seniors who are trying to get by on $13,000 a year or more, we are not going to cut Social Security. Vice President Biden, yesterday you endorsed an Elizabeth Warren plan that would undo key parts of the bankruptcy law you helped pass in 2005. A few hours ago, you announced support for making public college tuition free for families who make less than $125, 000 a year, something Senator Sanders has supported. Two things. Number one, let’s talk about the Bankruptcy Bill. The Bankruptcy Bill was passing overwhelmingly and I improved it. I had a choice. It was going to pass, and a Republican president, Republican Congress. I offered two amendments to make sure that people under $50,000 would not be affected, and women and children would go to the front of the line on alimony and support payments. That’s what I did. It passed overwhelmingly. I did not like the rest of the bill. But I improved it, number one. Number two, I’ve talked with Senator Warren about her proposal. This is the first opportunity we’ve had to make substantial change in what we couldn’t get done in a Republican administration. That’s why we talked last… two nights ago, and I supported her proposal. It’s a good proposal, it’s a solid proposal. She should get credit for having introduced it. With regard to what we’re talking about in terms of college education… I’ve been saying for a long time that we’re in a position where 12 years of education is not enough, is not enough for the 21st century. We need 16 years of education. The exact bill that Senator Sanders introduced, I guess a little over a year ago, capping it off at $125,000 in income. You could get free up to that point. After that, you’d have to pay for your college education. It only worked for public schools, and it would work for public universities in your state. I support that idea. It was a good idea and I support it. That’s what it is. I’m not saying everything Bernie’s said has been wrong, he happens to be right on that one. Senator Sanders, I assume you welcome these changes. Look, this is a little bit about leadership as well. Joe talked about bankruptcy. Joe, if my memory is correct, you helped write that Bankruptcy Bill. I did not. All right. I did not. That Bankruptcy Bill… By the way, when we talk about education, we got 45 million people in America struggling with student debt, some of them really struggling with student debt. That Bankruptcy Bill made it impossible, very difficult for people to escape from that student debt. It was a very, very bad bill. You said, Joe, that a majority of the people in the Senate voted for it. You’re right. Overwhelming majority. Overwhelmingly. Well, I voted against it in the House, and I was right. I don’t have to rethink my position, because that’s what leadership is about. Having the guts to take an unpopular vote. But it’s not just bankruptcy. The difference between Joe and I on higher education is… four years ago, it was not a popular idea, Joe. Glad you’re coming around now. Four years ago, when I said that public colleges and universities should be tuition free, people were saying, “Bernie, that’s a radical idea.” Well, you got states and cities and counties all over the country that are moving in that direction. I’m glad that Joe was on board. But what leadership is about, is going forward when it’s not popular, when it’s an idea that you get criticized for. So I’m proud of that fact, and I’m proud of my leadership on many issues. Joe, since the campaign, has come around. I talked about raising that minimum wage 15-bucks-an-hour, four years ago, Joe. So did I, and I went out and campaigned for it. $15 an hour, in New York city. Go to the Governor. I will talk to the Governor. I am not aware of it. I am not aware of it. You should be aware of it. All right. Four years ago, it was a radical idea. Very few people in Congress were talking about it. Go ahead, Vice President. Well here, look. Let’s get something straight about the Bankruptcy Bill. The Bankruptcy Bill already… It did not affect student debt for 90%, because the law had already been passed. You could not declare bankruptcy for those loans that were from private institutions. You couldn’t do it, as the Bankruptcy Bill did not affect that. It affected 10% of the people, the first Bankruptcy Bill. 10% of the student loans, number one. Number two. Now we’re in a position where we’re able to correct that problem. The fact is, if I hadn’t stepped up and changed the law as it relates to people making less than $50,000, those who… for alimony and child support, then guess what? They would have been in the bucket too. It was going to pass anyway. I made it… Let me finish. I made incrementally better. I did not like the bill. I did not support the bill. And I made it clear to the industry, I didn’t like the bill. Number two, this bill now calls for the opportunity to fundamentally change the mistakes we couldn’t correct in the bill the first time around. That is why I support Elizabeth Warren’s idea, and it’s a very good idea. Senator Sanders, go ahead. Well, this is kind of circular logic. We’re going to reform the bill that I voted for. Well, if you hadn’t voted for it, and if you rallied other people as I tried to do in the House voting against it, we might not have the problems with it we have today. What leadership is about, Joe, it deals whether your opposition or your support, I should say, for legislation regarding gay communities and the so-called Defense of Marriage Act. Yes, I do. Gay marriage today is considered a little bit differently than it was 25 years ago. I remember that vote. It was a very hard vote. I voted against the Defense of Marriage Act. You voted for it. I voted against the Bankruptcy Bill. You voted for it. I voted against the war in Iraq, which was also a tough vote. You voted for. I voted against disastrous trade agreements like NAFTA and PNT all with China, which costs this country over four million good paying jobs. You voted for it. I voted against the Hyde Amendment, which denies low income women the right to get an abortion. You have consistently voted for it. I don’t know what your position is on it today, but you have consistently voted for it. In other words, all that I’m saying here, we can argue about the merits of the bill. It takes courage sometimes to do the right thing. We can argue about the past and the future. This man voted against the Brady Bill five times. Background checks, background checks. Five times, number one. Number two, this man is the only… one of the few Democrats I know who voted to exempt the gun industry from being able to be sued. Talk about a special, special interest. We should be able to sue drug companies. We should be able to sue tobacco companies. We cannot sue the gun manufacturers, because he voted for that years ago. He says it was a mistake now. I’m prepared to accept he says it’s a mistake. The question is, what do we do from this point on? And by the way, I might add, I’m the first person to go on national television in any administration and say, I supported gay marriage. I supported gay marriage when asked. It started a ripple effect for gay marriage on national television. Leadership. We could argue this or that bill. But what I’m suggesting is that in this time of crisis, when we live in a really, really unsettling world… economically, from a healthcare prospective with the coronavirus, the people of America know my record. For 30 years, I have stood with the working families of this country. I have taken on every special interest there is out there, and that is what I will do in the White House. That’s a very different record than Joe’s. That is not a different record than mine. That is a totally different record than yours. All right? I mean, it’s manifested in this campaign when you’re getting all this money from wealthy people and billionaires. Thank you Senator Sanders. And that is take on special interest, I think I’m that candidate. The average campaign contribution, $44. Let’s talk about the future, Vice President Biden. He’s making it hard for me right now. I was trying to give him credit for some things. He won’t even take the credit for things he wants to do. Look, I think that I want to make it clear that Bernie as a nominee, I will not only support him, I will campaign for him. I believe the people who support me will do the same thing. Because the existential threat to the United States of America is Donald Trump. It’s critical. I would hope that Bernie would do the same thing if I am the nominee, and encourage all of his followers to in fact, support me as well. Because it’s much bigger than either of us. Character of the nation is on the ballot. It goes well beyond whether or not Senator Sanders and I both agree, we need medic… healthcare should be a right, not a privilege. We both agree we have to deal with student debt. We both agree we have to deal with education and access to education. We both agree that we have a new Green Deal to deal with the existential threat that faces humanity. We disagree on the detail of how we do it, but we don’t disagree on the principle. We fundamentally disagree with this president on everything. This is a man who wants to cut Social Security, cut Medicare. Not Bernie, the President of the United States. So this is much bigger than whether or not I’m the nominee or Bernie’s the nominee. We must defeat Donald Trump. He is the… Four more years of Donald Trump will fundamentally change the nature of who we are as a nation. We’ve got to restore this country’s soul, that’s essential. As long as this president is there, we’re not going to be able to that. Well, it’s just a quick question. Yeah. Which is, if he is the nominee, Vice-President Biden… You’ve already said you would support him. Of course. On day one, when I announced my candidacy, what I said is… This country cannot deal with a president who is a pathological liar, was running a corrupt administration or obviously doesn’t know the Constitution of the United States, who believes he’s above law, was a racist and a sexist and a homophobe. He is the most dangerous president in the modern history of this country. What I said on day one, Joe, day one, that obviously I hope to win the nomination. But if I don’t win the nomination, I and I think every other Democratic candidate, is prepared to come together to do everything humanly possible to defeat Donald Trump. But let me respond to something that Joe said. We talk about the Green New Deal and all of these things in general terms, but details make a difference. What I have said throughout this campaign, and I don’t think I’ve heard you say this yet, Joe… is that if we’re going to save this planet for our kids and future generations, we need to have the courage to take on the greed of the fossil fuel industry and make it clear to them that their short-term profits are not more important than the future of this planet. We have a very detailed planet, a detailed proposal. Happy to get the endorsement of the Sunrise Movement. Part 2 of March Democratic Debate Dr. … Gupta and this is CNN. Welcome back to the CNN-Univision Democratic Presidential debate, live from Washington DC. And as we noted, Arizona will vote on Tuesday. We solicited questions from undecided Democratic voters there. One is from Amy Langenfeld, who is a law professor from Chandler, Arizona, with a question for Senator Sanders. Women are the canaries in the coal mine of the Conservative agenda. Our access to healthcare is at risk- [crosstalk 00:00:31]… from the Federalist Society’s remaking of the courts. Our lives are threatened by abusive partners’ access to guns. Women are disproportionately affected by bail requirements, Social Security cuts and cuts to public education. How will your Cabinet ensure the best advice on issues that affect women’s physical and financial health? Thank you. My Cabinet, my administration will look like America, last I heard over half of the people in America are women and that will be the representation in my Cabinet and my administration. And in terms of policies, unlike Joe, I have consistently believed and I have a 100% lifetime voting record from groups like NARAL, that it is a women’s right to control her own body, not the government. I have believed that we have got to move aggressively to deal with domestic violence in this country. I have aggressively and I think effectively, made the case that we cannot have women in America earning 80 cents on the dollar compared to men. And if you’re a minority woman, it’s 50 or 60 cents on the dollar. We need to have universal, affordable, high-quality childcare, so women who are single or married can go off to work and know that their kids are going to be well taken care of. So I think if you look at my agenda, which is on berniesanders.com, what you will find, it is a very strong agenda in fighting for the rights of women, who today are under incredible political assault by Trump and Republican governors all across this country. Vice President Biden. Please. Yes, thank you. Number one, I agree with the question and the underlying premise of Amy’s question. Number one, I commit it that if I’m elected President and have an opportunity to appoint someone to the courts, I’ll appoint the first black woman to the courts. It’s required that they have representation, now it’s long overdue. Secondly, if I’m elected President, my Cabinet, my administration will look like the country. And I commit that I’ll pick a woman to be Vice President. There are a number of women who are qualified to be President tomorrow, I would pick a woman to be my Vice President. Number three, I’m the guy that wrote the domestic violence law and I’m the guy that put in the prohibitions that no one who abuses someone else should be able to own a gun, period. They should not be able to own a gun. I would get the boyfriend exception amended, now I’ve gotten it past that. If you are to get a stay away order from a court, you have a child with someone that you cannot own a gun. No one should be able in a gun who has abused a woman, period. Mr. Vice President, if I could just follow up. Yes. Please. … and ask Joe a question? Right now, a woman’s right to control her own body is under massive assault, unprecedented assault. It is. Joe, you have in the past on more than one occasion, voted for the Hyde Amendment which says that a woman, low-income woman could not use Medicaid funding for an abortion. It is not my view. It is not my view and by the way everybody who’s been in the Congress voted for the Hyde Amendment at one point or another, because it was locked in other bills. The reason why I affirmatively came out opposed to the Hyde Amendment was, that if we’re going to have public funding for all healthcare along the line, there is no way you could allow for there to be a requirement that you have Hyde Amendment, a woman who doesn’t have the money could not have coverage under healthcare. Well I’m glad. Number two… And I did that a while ago, okay. Number one. Number two, I would send immediately to the desk of the United States Congress, when I’m elected President, if I’m elected President, a codification of Roe V Wade amended by Casey because I think it is a woman’s right to choose. I think it’s a woman’s opportunity to be able to make that decision. And in fact, I’ve gotten a 100% rating from NARAL as well. I know my record of late from NARAL has been 100%. I don’t know whether it was 25 years ago. Well all right, I mean, I think one of the differences, not to pick a bone here, is I have been consistent. I’ve always believed in that and you have not. I’m glad you’ve changed your views. Senator, just to be clear, the Vice President committed to picking a woman as his running mate. In all likelihood, I will. For me, it’s not just nominating a woman. It is making sure that we have a progressive women and there are progressive women out there, so my very strong tendency is to move in that direction. Let’s turn now to immigration. Vice President Biden, you recently said for the first time that the Obama-Biden administration made a big mistake in deporting millions of immigrants, but you didn’t publicly speak out against it at the time. Number one, I said that it took much too long to get it right and the President did get it right by DACA as well as making sure that it tried to protect parents as well and by the way, moving on an immigration bill as well. The fact is that we already had a vote on immigration bill, by the way, and Bernie voted against it, the immigration bill. Had he voted forward and had passed, we’d already have 6 million undocumented would be citizens as I speak right now. But I will send to the desk immediately a bill that requires access to citizenship for 11 million undocumented folks, number one. Number two, the first hundred days of my administration, no one, no one will be deported at all. From that point on, the only deportations that will take place are commissions of felonies in the United States of America. Period. Is, it’s about uniting families. It’s about making sure that we can both be a nation of immigrants, as well as a nation that is decent. Let me respond and I’ll answer your question. Let me respond to Joe’s comments about the 2007 immigration bill. That bill was opposed by LULAC, the largest Latino organization in America. The Southern Poverty Law Center called it’s guest-worker programs akin to slavery. There wasn’t really a vote on the bill. It was killed because there was a vote on the Dorgan amendment, I think it was 49-48. And you know who voted with me on that one Joe? Barack Obama. He understood that that proposal was a bad idea. We don’t need slavery in America where workers, guest-workers are forced to say with their employers. But in terms of immigration in general, let me outline some of the things that we do. Day one, we restore the legal status of 1.8 million young people and their parents in the DACA program. Number two, immediately, we end these ICE raids, which are terrorizing communities all over this country. Three, we changed the border policy, under my administration, no federal agent will ever grab little babies from the arms of their mothers. And fourth, I think we can pass what the American people want and that is comprehensive immigration reform, path towards citizenship for the 11 million undocumented. Dr. Senator Sanders, critics suggest, positions like this send a message that when a Democrat is in the White House, the border is open. No. That’s just… I mean that’s what Trump says and that is a total lie. What we’re talking about is a humane, sensible policy supported by the American people. Nobody is talking about open borders and of course Trump lies about that. But the bottom line is, right now you have in this country, people who have been here for decades, they are working hard, they’re raising their kids. They are an important part of our agricultural economy, our construction economy. These are good people and yet they are living in terror and we have got to end that terror and end the ICE raids and move toward a path towards citizenship. Let me set the record straight on something what was said. You know the idea that it was slavery, Barack Obama supported that immigration bill. Teddy Kennedy supported that immigration bill. I supported it. I doubt whether those people think it’s slavery. And by the way, right after his vote against that, he went on the Lou Dobbs show and continued to canard, that they’re taking jobs. These immigrants are taking jobs from Americans, which is one of the Republican canards, right after that no vote. And with regard to your question relative to whether or not I would deal with supporting the border. Look, we can deal with securing the border by national technical means. All the bad things are coming through ports of entry right now, we don’t need a wall. And by the way, I would immediately as President, surge to the border, I would end this notion for the first time in history that people seeking asylum have to be in squalor on the other side of the river, in a desperate situation. They should be able to come to the United States and have a judgment made is whether or not they qualify. I would also surge to the border immigration judges to make decisions immediately and no one, no one would be put in jail while waiting for their hearing. That’s kind of what I’ve been saying throughout the entire campaign. So have I. So what we need is, at the border, hundreds of administrative judges. We need to deal with people who are seeking asylum, based on international law. We need not to be dividing children from their parents and dividing families up. We need a humane border policy. And I’ll tell you what else we need and I speak as the son of an immigrant. My father came to this country from Poland at the age of 17, without a nickel in his pocket, couldn’t speak English, didn’t have much of an education. I will end, on day one, the demonization, the ugly demonization from the White House of the immigrant community in this country. We’ve got a President who is trying to divide us up. My administration brings our people together, black and white and Latino, Native American, Asian American. Thank you Senator Sanders. No. Of course not. Look… And one of the things that goes on when you have that process, is that not only the psychological terror, and I’ve talked to these kids, kids are scared to death in America when they come home from school that their mom or dad may not be there, may be deported. What we need to do is to end, and I will end this on day one, the ICE raids that have been so harmful to so many people. And we need to do, again, what the American people want us to do. I’m the son of an immigrant. This is a country significantly built by immigrant labor, built by slave labor and what we have got to do is appreciate each other and end this demonization and the divisiveness this coming from the Trump administration. Go ahead. Look, we are a nation of immigrants, our future rests upon the Latino community being fully integrated. 24 out of every 100 children in school today from kindergarten through high school is a Latino, right now today. The idea that any American thinks it doesn’t pay for us to significantly invest in their future is absolutely a bizarre notion, because if we do not invest everything that the very wealthy are concerned about and the xenophobes are concerned about, will in fact get worse, not better. We should be embracing, bringing them in, just like what happened with the Irish immigrants after the famine, just what happened with the Italians, et cetera. We’ve been through this before, xenophobia is a disease. Thank you Vice President Biden. Let’s move now to the climate crisis. I’m coming right to you Senator Sanders. The world Health Organization calls the climate crisis, a “Health crisis” and warns that climate change could fuel the spread of infectious diseases. Well, of course we do. I mean we… Look, this is what the scientists are telling us, the same scientists who make your point there, Jake. What they’re telling us is, if we don’t get our act together in the next seven or eight years, there would be irreversible damage done to this planet. We’re talking about cities in America, from Miami to New Orleans to Charleston, South Carolina being underwater. We are talking about severe droughts which will prevent farmers in the Midwest from growing the food that we need. We’re talking about extreme weather disturbances which hit Houston Texas, Venice Italy, just a few months ago. We are talking about the absolute need and I want to hear Joe’s position on this. This is not a middle of the ground thing. This is not building a few more solar panels or a few more wind turbines. What this is about is transforming our energy system, as quickly as we humanly can, away from fossil fuel. It is insane that we continue to have fracking in America. It is absurd that we give tens of billions of dollars a year in tax breaks and subsidies to the fossil fuel industry. This has got the end and end now if we love our kids and future generations. First thing that President Obama and I were summoned to the State Department… Excuse me, the Defense Department for was to meet with all the chiefs, the single greatest threat to our national security, they said, is climate change. Single greatest threat to our national security, because as populations have to move because they can no longer live where they are, because their islands are sinking, because you saw what happened in Darfur, with the change in weather patterns and the deserted there. It causes war, it causes great migrations, great migrations. They said that’s the single biggest problem. Number two, there’s an awful lot of people today who are in fact getting ill because of the changes in the environment, particularly up where Bernie lives. I’m not… It has nothing to do with him. But having, up in the Northeast, because you have everything from beetle infestation and a whole range of things that are causing diseases as well, in addition to eliminating foliage. Yes. … they told you at the Pentagon. The price tag for your climate plan is about $1.7 trillion. That’s about $14 trillion less than Senator Sanders wants to spend on this. Yes, it is ambitious enough to tackle the crisis, because what… Go to joebiden.com, I lay out the first 13 things I would do immediately upon being elected. Number one, we’re going to once again reinstate all the cuts the President made and everything from the cafe standards, how far automobiles can go, investing in light rail so that we take cars off the road, making sure we’re in a position where we are now in a position that we put 500,000 charging stations in areas that… [silence 00:17:03] … all new highways that we built, making sure that we spent $500 billion a year… [silence 00:17:22] and the federal government paying for transportation, the vehicles we run, all of those being converted to being able to run on low carbon fuel and/or be able to run on no carbon fuel at all by having them move into a direction that is all carbon free. We can do these things. We can lay down the tracks where nothing can be changed by the next President or the following President, the one beyond that. In addition to that, we also have to… I would immediately rejoin the Paris climate accord, which I helped put together. I would call the 100 nations, over a hundred nations, but the hundred major polluters to the United States and the first hundred days, to up the ante and make it clear that in fact if they didn’t, there’d be a price to pay. And lastly, I would be right now organizing the hemisphere and the world, to provide $20 billion for the Amazon, for Brazil no longer to burn the Amazon, so they could have forests… They’re no longer forests but they could have farming and say, “This is what we’re going to do.” … the region is burning out than we admit in one entire year, per year. Thank you, Mr. Vice President. All well and good, but nowhere near enough. I mean, you mentioned, we started this debate talking about a warlike situation in terms of the coronavirus and we said, “We have to act accordingly.” You said it. I think you’re right. I said it. We have to act dramatically, boldly, if we’re going to save lives in this country and around the world. I look at climate change in exactly the same way. It’s not a question of reentering the Paris Accord. That’s fine. Who cares? It’s not a big deal. The deal right now is, do we have the courage? And this gets back to the point I’m trying to make all night long. Look, in terms of the fossil fuel industry, these guys have been lying, they’ve been lying for years, like the tobacco industry lied 50 years ago. “Oh we don’t know if fossil fuels, if oil and carbon emissions are causing climate change.” They knew. ExxonMobil knew, they lied. In fact, I think they should be held criminally accountable. But this Jake, is an issue of enormous consequence. What Joe was saying goes nowhere near enough. It’s not a question of money. Give me a minute here. We have time to talk about this. This is a world shaking event. I understand. I just want to give him a chance to respond and then we can come back to you. Okay, fine let’s stay on. We’re staying on this issue. Number one, no more subsidies for fossil fuel industry. No more drilling on federal lands. No more drilling, including offshore. No ability for the oil industry to continue to drill, period, ends, number one. Number two, we’re in a situation as well where we cannot… We are able to move rapidly to change the dynamic, in terms of what we can do to set in motion. The fact that he says climate change, Paris Accord doesn’t mean much. We could get everything exactly right, we’re 15% of the problem. 85% of the problem is over there. We need someone who can deal internationally. We need someone who can bring the together again. We need someone who can move in a direction that in fact, if you violate the commitment you make, you will pay an economic price for it. Like what’s happening in China there they’re exporting coal, significant coal. Thank you. Okay. Look, obviously the Paris Accord is useful, but it doesn’t go anywhere… If you’re laughing Joe, then you’re missing the point. You’re missing the point. This is an existential crisis. Bingo. You talk about… I’m talking about stopping fracking, as soon as we possibly can. I’m talking about telling the fossil fuel industry that they are going to stop destroying this planet. No ifs, buts and maybes about it. So am I. … to China… Well, I’m not sure your proposal does that. I’m talking about speaking to China, to Russia, to countries all over the world and in this moment, making the point that instead of spending 1.8 trillion on weapons of destruction designed to kill each other, maybe we should pool our resources and fight our common enemy, which is climate change. I know your heart is in the right place, but this requires dramatic, bold action. We’ve got to take on the fossil fuel industry. Your plan does not do that. My plan takes on the fossil fuel industry and it unites the world. He just got finished saying, what’s he going to do? He’s going to bring these countries together, making it clear to them. I’m saying we bring them together, make them live up to the commitments. If they don’t live up to the commitments, they pay a financial price for it. They pay an economic price for it. Because we can do everything, my state is three feet above sea level. I don’t need a lecture on what’s going to happen about rising seas. I know what happens. I watched the whole Delmarva Peninsula, just like it is in South Carolina and the rest. Something I know a little bit about, I wrote the first climate change bill that was in the Congress, which PolitiFact said was a game changer. I’m the guy who came along and said with Dick Lugar, that we’re going to trade, we’ll forgive your debt if you don’t cut down your FARs. I’ve been way ahead of this curve. This idea that all of a sudden Bernie found this out is amazing to me. No, Bernie didn’t find it out. Bernie is listening to the scientists and what… You’re talking about making countries around the world fulfill their commitments. Those commitments are not enough. What this moment is about Joe, is that the scientists are telling us they underestimated the severity of the crisis. They were wrong. The problem is more severe. So all that I’m saying right here is that we are fighting for the future of this planet, for the wellbeing of our kids and future generations. You cannot continue, as I understand Joe believes, to continue fracking, correct me if I’m wrong. Thank you. … and energy efficiency. Thank you Senator. No more, no new fracking. And by the way, on the Recovery Act, I was able to make sure we invested $90 billion in making sure we brought down the price of solar and wind, that is lower than the price of coal. That’s why not another new coal plant will be built. I did that while you were watching, number one. Number two, we’re in a situation where we in fact have the ability to lay down the tracks where no one can change the dynamic. And that’s why we should be talking about things like I’ve been talking about for years, high speed rail, taking millions of automobiles off the road. Thank you. … of the United States military to… I know. Thank you, Mr. Vice President. Yes. … which is a method of extracting natural gas. The shift towards natural gas and away from coal has resulted in reduced US carbon emissions. Because we have to invest in an unprecedented way, in an unprecedented way. You started off by saying that we’re talking about a 13, $14 trillion investment. That is a lot of money and I’ve been criticized for that. But I don’t know what the alternative is, if we are playing for the future of this planet. So we’ve got to be dramatic and what being dramatic is, massive investments in wind, in solar and sustainable energies in general and research and development, in making our buildings all over this country… In my state of Vermont and around this country, got a lot of old buildings. Welcome back to the CNN Univision Democratic presidential debate on Tuesday. Voters in Arizona, Ohio, Illinois, and Florida will cast their votes in the democratic primary. Here’s Univision’s Ilia Calderón. Thank you, Jake. Let’s move now to foreign policy. Senator Sanders, there are about 1.5 million Cuban Americans living in Florida right now. Why would they vote for you when they hear you praise a program of Fidel Castro, a dictator who jailed, tortured, and killed thousands of Cubans. I have opposed or authoritarianism, whether it’s in Cuba, whether it’s in Saudi Arabia, whether it’s in China or whether it is in Russia. That is my life record. I believe unlike the president of the United States, in democracy, not authoritarianism in Cuba or any place else. What I believe right now in this world is that we are faced with a global crisis and a movement toward authoritarianism. That’s what Putin in Russia is leading, that’s what MBS in Saudi Arabia is leading. And as president of the United States, unlike Donald Trump, I will put the flag down and say that in this country and in this world, we have got a move toward democracy and human rights. That is my view and has always been my view. To be clear, Senator Sanders, Cuba has been a dictatorship for decades. Well, I think you can make the same point about China. China is undoubtedly an authoritarian society. Okay? But would anybody deny, any economists deny that extreme poverty in China today is much less than what it was 40 or 50 years ago? That’s a fact. So I think we condemn authoritarianism, whether it’s in China, Russia, Cuba, any place else. But to simply say that nothing ever done by any of those administrations had a positive impact on their people, would I think be incorrect. He was trying to change Cuban policies so the Cuban people would get out from under the thumb of the Castro and his brother. That is to change the policy so that we can impact on Cuba’s policy by getting them opened up. That was about, but the praising of the Sandinistas, the praising of Cuba, the praising just now of China. China is an authoritarian dictatorship. That’s what it is. We have to deal with them because they’re there. But the idea that they in fact have increased the wealth of people in that country, it’s been marginal that change that’s taken place. It is still, they have a million Uyghurs, a million Muslims in prison camps in the West. You see what’s happening in Hong Kong today. And by the way, the idea that he praised the Soviet Union when it was the Soviet Union about the things that they had done well, they are an awful dictatorship killing millions and millions of people. And in addition to that, we have a circumstance where after the election was all over and we knew what was done by the Russians now and interfering with our elections, this man voted against sanctioning Russia for interference in our elections. Senator Sanders. I don’t get it. Well, what you don’t get in. This is exactly what the problem with politics is about. All right. Question. Did China make progress in ending extreme poverty over the last 50 years? That’s a no. That’s like saying Jack the ripper. No, it’s not Joe. Yes, it is. You see, Joe, this is the problem. Yes, it is. This is the problem. We can’t talk … I know there’s a political line, I understand. China’s terrible, awful, nothing ever good [inaudible 00:04:10] but the fact of the matter is China, of course is an authoritarian state. It’s what I just said. It’s a dictatorship. That’s what I just said five minutes ago. And by the way, the question that was asked quoted Barack Obama, president Obama was more generous in his praise of what Cuba did in healthcare and education than I was. I was talking about a program 60 years ago in the first year of the Castro revolution. So the bottom line is, that I think it’s a little bit absurd if we’re going to look at the world the way it is. Of course, we are opposed to authoritarian. And by the way, before it was considered good policy, good idea. With me. I was condemning the dictatorship in the UAE, you were not. Yes, I was. Thank you, Senator Sanders, Vice president Biden. Look, the idea of occasionally saying something nice about a country is one thing. The idea of praising a country that is violating human rights around the world is in fact makes our allies wonder what’s going on. What do you think the South Koreans think when he praises China like that? What do you think the Australians believe in the shadow of China? What do you think is happening in Indonesia in the shadow of China? What do you think is happening in terms of Japan in the shadow of China? Words matter. These are flat out dictators, period, and they should be called for it. Straight up. We may have to work out. For example, I was able to help negotiate a new start agreement with Russia, not because I like Putin, the guy is a thug. Mr. Vice president, sticking with foreign policy, you acknowledge that your support and vote for the Iraq war was a mistake. I learned I can’t take the word of a president when in fact they assured me that they would not use force. Remember the context, the context was the United Nations Security Council was going to vote to insist that we allow inspectors into determine whether or not they were in fact producing nuclear weapons or weapons of mass destruction. They were not. And what’s the first thing that happened when we got elected? The president Obama turned to me and said, get those troops out of the hours responsible for getting 150,000 combat troops out of Iraq. I admitted 14 years ago was in [spect 00:06:43] to have trusted him and I’m prepared to compare my foreign policy credentials up against my friend here on any day of the week and every day of the week. Okay, let’s start off with the war in Iraq, Joe, I was there too. I was in the house. I understood … and by the way, let’s be clear about what that vote was and you were there at the signing ceremony with Bush. Everybody in the world knew that when you voted for that resolution, you were giving Bush the authority to go to war and everybody knew that’s exactly what he and Cheney wanted to do. Most people who followed that issue closely understood that the Bush administration was lying through its teeth with regard to Saddam having weapons of mass destruction. I understood that, I was on the floor of the house time and time again. But the issue is not just the war in Iraq. That was a long time ago. The issue is the trade agreement. The issue was the bankruptcy bill that you supported. The issue was the Hyde amendment. The issue is the defense of marriage Act. The issue is whether or not in difficult times and God knows these are difficult times. We’re going to have the courage to take on powerful special interest and do what’s right for the working families of this country. Vice president Biden. You know why? Because I had every … you keep talking about Iran that was tied to Iran. Russia was in Iran. I think John Kerry indicated his support for what I did. That was undermining the Iranian agreement. That’s why. That’s not true. That’s why, and that’s the only reason why I have condemned Russia time and time again. Vice president Biden. The fact is that the idea that I in fact supported the things that you suggested is not accurate. Look, I’m the guy that helped put together the Iran deal and got the inspectors in there. My chief of staff was the guy, my foreign policy guy doing that negotiation, I was the guy that helped put together a 60-nation organization to take on the ISIS in Iraq and in Syria. I’ve dealt with these folks, I know them, and I know what they’re like and I know who the good guys are and who the bad guys are. The fact is, this Bernie’s notion about how he embraces folks like the Sandinistas and Cuba and the former Soviet Union and talks about the good things they did in China is absolutely contrary to every message we want to send the rest of the world. Senator Sanders. I have led the effort against all forms of authoritarianism, including America’s so-called allies in the UAE and in Saudi Arabia. And in fact, as you may know, worked with conservative Republicans to utilize for the very first time the War Powers Act to get the United States out of the horrific war in Yemen led by Saudi Arabia. That’s what I did. So my view is that in a world moving toward authoritarianism, the United States has got to be the leader where people all over the world look to us for guidance. Thank you, Senator. Thank you gentlemen. I want to change topics and ask each of you about some of your vulnerabilities in this election. Starting with you, Vice president Biden, Senator Sanders has one more of the Hispanic vote than you in several key States so far. In fact, he doubled your support in California among Hispanics. He almost tripled it in Nevada. Well, look, my message has resonated across the board. Every single state we’ve been in, there’s been a significant turnout. In Virginia, turnout was up 70%, they voted for me. He didn’t bring them out, I brought them out. And number two, look what’s happened in Mississippi. Look what’s happened in North Carolina, look what’s happened in Washington state. Look what’s happening across the board. Why is it that I’m winning all those places? What’s the reason? What’s the reason? The reason is because they know I am a Democrat with a capital D who in fact believes that our base is the base of the Democratic party, which are hardworking men and women who are in fact are high school educated, African Americans and minorities, including Hispanics, but all minorities. Suburban women, people who in fact have a sense of our place in the world. That’s why I am winning, not just winning, but overwhelmingly winning, not even close in these places. Senator Sanders, let me just follow up with you about an issue that you’re having for the second consecutive presidential election. You’re struggling to gain wide support from African-Americans. Here is what I believe is happening and this is an important point and why I decided to run for president. I think it’s imperative that we defeat Trump. I think our campaign of a biracial, bigenerational, multigenerational grassroots movement is the way to do it. Now we have won some states, Joe has won more States than I have, but here’s what we are winning. We are winning the ideological struggle. Even in States like Mississippi where Joe won a major victory. It turns out that a pretty good majority of the folks there believe in Medicare for … and that’s true in almost every state in this country. And the other issue that we don’t talk enough about is we are winning the generational struggle. Depending on the state, we’re winning people 50 years of age or younger, big time people, 30 years of age and younger. I frankly have my doubts. Look, if I lose this thing, Joe wins, Joe, I will be there for you. But I have my doubts about how you win a general election against Trump will be a very, very tough opponent unless you have energy, excitement, the largest voter turnout in history. And to do that you are going to have to bring young people who are not great voters. They don’t vote in the kinds of numbers they should into the political process. You’re going to have to bring Latinos who are great people, have the agenda that we need, but also don’t vote in the numbers that we need. I have my doubts that vice president Biden’s campaign can generate that energy and excitement and that voter turnout. I will do that. And by the way, just get this straight. The energy and excitement is taking place so far has been for me. 70% turnout increased in Virginia, I can go down the list, they’re coming out for me and I didn’t even have the money to compete with this man in those States. I virtually had no money. The press kept saying Biden has no money and they were right by net, no money. And the idea, why are they doing that? The reason they’re doing that is because they understand I know what has to happen, that I know what needs to be done. And by the way, the idea that everybody supports Medicare for all he has still hadn’t indicated how much it’s going to cost people. He’s yet to know exactly what’s going to … So here’s my point. Thank you, sir. … overwhelmingly among democratic constituencies across the board. Thank you Mr. Vice president. We are going to be right back with more from the CNN Univision Democratic presidential debates. Stay right there. Welcome back to the CNN Univision Democratic Presidential Debate. Finally, gentlemen, thanks so much for everything. As we end here tonight, let’s return to where we began, the coronavirus, which does not discriminate based on ideology. It does not care if one is a Democrat or Republican, a Conservative, a Moderate or a Progressive. Senator Sanders, let me start with you. Well, our hearts go out to everyone. We need to move aggressively, to make sure that every person in this country who has the virus, who thinks they have the virus, understands they get all the healthcare that they need, because they are Americans, that we move aggressively to make sure that the test kits are out there, that the ventilators are out there, that the ICU units are out there, that the medical personnel are out there. But Jake, if I might also say, that in this moment of economic uncertainty, in addition to the coronavirus, it is time to ask how we get to where we are, not only our lack of preparation for the virus, but how we end up with an economy, with so many about people are hurting at a time of massive income and wealth inequality. It is time to ask the question of where the power is in America. Why do we pump up the oil industry while a half a million people are homeless in America? This is the time to move aggressively, dealing with the coronavirus crisis, to deal with the economic fallout, but it’s also a time to rethink America, and create a country where we care about each other, rather than a nation of greed and corruption, which is what is taking place among the corporate elite. Thank you, senator Sanders. Number one, as I said at the outset, I just can’t imagine what people are going through right now who have lost someone already. I can’t imagine what people are going through when they have a mom. Like for example, a good friend of ours is sitting outside the window of a nursing home where her mom is because she can’t go in, trying to do sign language to her mom and through the window to be able to talk to her. I guess I can imagine the fear and concern people have. Number one, one of the things that I think we have to understand is that this is an all hands on deck. This is, as someone said, maybe it was you Jake at the outset, this is bigger than any individual. This is bigger than yourself. This is about America. This is about the world. This is about how we bring people together and make the kind of sacrifices we need to make to get this done, and so first and foremost, where we have to do is start to listen to the science again. And then what do we do beyond that to make sure that the economic impact on them is in fact rendered harmless? That we in fact make sure every paycheck is met, every paycheck that’s out there that the people are going to miss, that we keep people in their homes, they don’t miss their mortgage payments, they don’t miss their rent payments, making sure that they’re going to be able to take care of education, and by the way, the education systems are closing down right now, and so there’s so many things we have to do. In addition to that, we have to do is we have to have the best science in the world and telling us what can stay open and what need be closed. Like I said earlier, the idea that we are closing schools, which I understand, but not being able to provide lunches for people who in fact need the school lunch program to get by. The idea that we would close any place that I can understand the decision made to close places where a hundred or 50 people or more gather, but how do you keep open the drug store to make sure you can get your prescription? How do you deal with the things that necessarily have to be kept going and what’s the way to do that? There should be a national standard for that. It should be coming out of the situation room right now. And by the way, the single most significant thing we can do should deal with the larger problem down the road of income inequality is get rid of Donald Trump, Donald Trump. He’s exacerbated every single one of these problems, both the immediate urgent need, and how we’re going to hold people harmless for the damage done as a consequence of this virus. It’s important we do both. Vice President Biden, Senator Sanders, I would want to thank you both for being here tonight under these challenging and trying circumstances. We wish both of you the best. Our thanks as well to our partners at Univision. For Ilia Calderon and Dana Bash, I’m Jake Tapper. Thank you so much for watching. Please stay healthy. Stay safe. Our coverage of both tonight’s debate and the coronavirus pandemic continues now with Anderson Cooper. Jake, thanks very much. There you have the CNN Univision Democratic Debate, Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, and a third unwelcome player, the coronavirus. The candidates acknowledged it at the closed debate in their final remarks."
"43","03-16-21"," So you’ve set out your goals for the country, 100 million vaccine doses by next week, $100 million dollars out the door, every American eligible for the vaccine by, adult American, by May 1st, something close to normal on July 4th. Well, first of all, I won’t even be able to meet the July 4th deadline unless people listen, wear masks, wash their hands, and socially distance, because not everyone by July 4th will have been vaccinated. I honest to God thought we had it out. I honest to God thought that once we guarantee we had enough vaccine for everybody, things would start to calm down. Well, they have calmed down a great deal, but I just don’t understand this sort of macho thing about, “I’m not going to get the vaccine. I have a right as an American, my freedom to not do it. I can hug my grandkids now. They come over to the house. I can see them. I’m able to be with them. I’ve had the vaccine. Secondly, it has changed my life in the sense that I’ve been able to demonstrate to other people that, I doubt whether people expected me to take it if I didn’t think it was safe, to make the case that it is safe to take the vaccine. It’s important to take the vaccine. Let’s talk about the crisis at the border. Some heartbreaking scenes down there right now. A lot of the migrants coming in saying they’re coming in because you promised to make things better. It seems to be getting worse by the day. Well, first of all, there was a surge the last two years. In ’19 and ’20 there was a surge as well. This one might be worse. No. Well, it could be, but here’s the deal. First of all, the idea that Joe Biden said come because I heard the other day that they’re they’re coming because they know I’m a nice guy and I won’t do what Trump did. They’re saying this. Yeah. Well, here’s the deal. They’re not. The adults are being sent back, number one. Number two, what do you do with an unaccompanied child that comes to the border? Do you repeat what Trump did? Take them from their mothers, move them away, hold them in cells, et cetera. We’re not doing that. What we’re doing is we have brought in HHS and also brought in FEMA to provide for enough safe facilities for them to get out of the control of the border patrol, which are not designed to hold people for long periods of time, particularly children, get them out of those facilities. Most of them come with a phone number. What we’re doing is we’re putting together an entire organizational structure so that within seven days they’re able to get on the phone, contact that number, find out whether there is a mother or a father, whether it is safe, whether it’s a secure circumstance to get the child to that adult. It’s going to take some time though to get those policies in place again. Do you have to say quite clearly, “Don’t come. Yes. I can say quite clearly, “Don’t come.” What we’re in the process of getting set up, and it’s not going to take a whole long time, is to be able to apply for asylum in place. Don’t leave your town or city or community. We’re going to make sure we have facilities in those cities and towns run by DHS and also access with HHS, the Health and Human Services, to say you can apply for asylum from where you are right now. Make your case. We’ll have people there to determine whether or not you are able to meet the requirement you qualify for asylum. That’s the best way to do this. In addition to that, while we also change the circumstances on the ground in those communities, you’re going to diminish the reason why people want to leave in the first place. You’re out here selling your COVID relief package. You’re executing the COVID relief package now as well. If you notice the criticism of the COVID relief package, my Republican friends, is they say it spends too much money and it gives too many tax breaks. All these tax breaks go to the bottom 60% of the population. Guess what? They need it, the $1,400 check, childcare tax credit. They don’t like it because in fact their idea of a tax cut is to give the Trump tax cut where 83% went to the top 1% of the people in America. You’re going to be raising those taxes. Yes. Anybody making more than $400,000 will see a small to a significant tax increase. If you make less than $400,000, you won’t see one single penny in additional federal tax. But, let’s talk raw politics here. You didn’t get a single Republican vote for tax cuts. Oh, I may not get it, but I’ll get the Democratic votes for a tax increase. If we just took the tax rate back to what it was when Bush was president, the top rate paid 39.6% in federal taxes, that would raise $230 billion. Yet, they’re complaining because I’m providing a tax credit for childcare, for the poor, for the middle class, keeping people, and by the way, my proposal in the relief plan I put forward, it creates seven million jobs according to a whole range of people, including Moody’s on Wall Street, number one. Increases the GDP by over a trillion dollars. Actually raises, raises income in America and diminishes debt in America. By your own admission, just so you’re not likely to get Republican votes for the tax increase, you’re not likely to get Republican for H.R.1, expanding voting rights or the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. Aren’t you going to have to choose? I know you’ve been reluctant to do away with the filibuster. Yes, but here’s the choice. I don’t think you have to eliminate the filibuster. You have to do it what it used to be when I first got to the Senate back in the old days when you used to be around there. That is that a filibuster, you had to stand up and command the floor. You had to keep talking alone. No one could say quorum call. Once you stopped talking, you lost that and someone could move in and say, “I move the question of,”. You got to work for the filibuster. You’re for that reform. You’re for bringing back the talking filibuster. I am. That’s what it was supposed to be. Look, don’t hold me to the numbers, George, but I think between 1960 and 2000, there were like, I’m making this number up, I don’t know. There were like 50 filibusters. Now there are like 200 since then, since that rule changed. Just put a hold on it, that’s it. Yeah. I mean, the idea, it almost is getting to the point where democracy is having a hard time functioning, a hard time functioning. They haven’t had that epiphany you said you were going to see in the campaign. No, no. Well, I’ve only been here six weeks, pal. Okay. Give me a break. I’ve been here six weeks. I think the epiphany is going to come between now and 2022. There’s 78% of the people say they support this program, 52% of Republicans. Let’s assume it’s off by 15%. You’re going to go home and campaign. Republican voters want that $1,500 because they’re in trouble. Republican voters want to be able to choose between being able to go to work and send their kid to a daycare that they can afford. Republican voters want to be able to take care of a childcare tax credit. I mean, it’s not like every Republican voter is a billionaire. By the way, I’m not saying I’ll do it again, but I want those Republican voters in suburbia. Director of National Intelligence came out with a report today saying that Vladimir Putin authorized operations during the election to denigrate you, support President Trump, undermine our elections, divide our society. He will pay a price. We had a long talk he and I. I know him relatively well. The conversation started off I said, “I know you and you know me. If I establish this occurred, then be prepared. You said you know he doesn’t have a soul. I did say that to him, yes. His response was, “We understand one another.” I wasn’t being a wise guy. I was alone with him in his office. That’s how it came about. It was when President Bush had said, “I’ve looked in his eyes and saw his soul.” I said, “I looked in your eyes and I don’t think you have a soul.” He looked back at me and he said, “We understand each other.” Look, the most important thing in dealing with foreign leaders in my experience, and I’ve dealt with an awful lot of them over my career, is just know the other guy. You know Vladimir Putin. Mm-hmm (affirmative). I do. The price he is going to pay, well, you’ll see shortly. By the way, we ought to be able that old, that trite expression and walk and chew gum at the same time, there are places where it’s in our mutual interest to work together. That’s why I renewed the START agreement with him. That occurred while he’s doing this, but that’s overwhelmingly in the interest of humanity that we diminish the prospect of a nuclear exchange. President Trump reached a deal with the Taliban to have all American troops leave by May 1st. I’m in the process of making that decision now as to when they’ll leave. The fact is that that was not a very solidly-negotiated deal that the former President worked out. We’re in consultation with our allies, as well as the government. That decision’s going to be, it’s in process now. I don’t think a lot longer. But May 1st is tough. It could happen, but it is tough. Because, look, one of the drawbacks, George, and this going to be like Sanskrit to people listening here, but it is the failure to have an orderly transition from the Trump presidency to my presidency, which usually takes place from election day to the time you’re sworn in, has cost me time and consequences. For example, we didn’t realize how bad things were in terms of lack of vaccines. We were not able to get access to this information. That’s one of the issues we’re talking about now in terms of Afghanistan. Let me ask you about Governor Cuomo of New York. I know you’ve said you want the investigation to continue. Yes. I think he will probably end up being prosecuted too. But, how about right now? You said you want the investigation to continue. You saw Chuck Schumer, Senator Schumer, Senator Gillibrand, a majority of the congressional delegation don’t think he can be an effective governor right now. Well, that’s a judgment for them to make about their state where they can be effective. Here’s my position. It’s been my position since I wrote the Violence Against Women Act. A woman should be presumed to telling the truth and should not be scapegoated and become victimized by her coming forward, number one. But there should be an investigation to determine whether what she says is true. That’s what’s going on now. You’ve been very clear. If the investigation confirms the claims, he’s gone. That’s what I think happens. By the way, it may very well be that there could be a criminal prosecution that is attached to it. I just don’t know. I don’t know what it is, but I started from the presumption it takes a lot of courage for a woman to come forward. The presumption is it should be taken seriously and it should be investigated. That’s what’s underway now. You probably walked into the oval office as president with about as much experience, if not more experience, than any other president who has ever served, more than three decades in the Senate, eight years as vice president. What has surprised me is that I’m not as surprised as I thought I might be. I don’t know if that makes any sense. It’s like sitting when I was vice-president, the big, big difference is that famous expression of Harry Truman, “The buck stops here.” For eight years, I had a great relationship, and still do with Barack. I’d always be the last person in the room. I’d say, “Throw the pass,” or, “Run the ball.” I’d give my opinion. I was the last guy and I get to leave, but he’s all by himself to have to make that decision. That’s the big difference. Most of the time, yes. As a practical matter, yeah, she is. One final question. Sure. Yeah, the answer is yes. Major was a rescue pup. Major did not bite someone and penetrate the skin. The dog is being trained now with our trainer at home in Delaware. He was going home. I didn’t banish him to home. Jill was going to be away for four days. I was going to be away for two so we took him home. But, you turn a corner and there’s two people I don’t know at all. They move and he moves to protect. But, he’s a sweet dog. 85% of the people there love him. He just, all he does is lick them and wag his tail. I’m going to see him tonight, yeah. Mr. President, thanks for your time. Thank you, George. I appreciate it."
"44","03-17-20"," And I hope all of you are staying safe, talking and taking the recommended precautions and talking to the docs, if you have one, to keep your social distance, to slow the spread of this virus. This pandemic has impacted every aspect of our lives and every aspect of this campaign. Most of all, my heart goes out to all of those of you who’ve lost a loved one. To those who have contracted the virus. To all the brave Americans who are working harder than ever to help their neighbors and all those children that are home from school that are worried and don’t know quite why. Doctors, nurses, EMTs and public health officials, as well as the frontline emergency workers like firefighters and dedicated folks working to keep the shelves stocked in the grocery stores. You know, tackling this pandemic is a national emergency, akin to fighting a war and it’s going to require leadership and cooperation from every level of government. And it’s going to require us to move thoughtfully and decisively to quickly address both the public health crisis as well as the economic crisis. It’s going to require us to pay attention to the medical and scientific and health experts. And it’s going to require each of us to do our part. Yes, this is a moment where we need our leaders to lead, but it’s also a moment where the choices and decisions we make as individuals are going to collectively impact on what happens. Make a big difference in the severity of this outbreak and the ability of our medical hospital systems to handle it. You know, I know we as a people are up to this challenge, we always have been. I know that we’ll answer this moment of crisis with the best that we find in all of us because that’s what Americans always have done and what we do. That’s who we are, ordinary people doing extraordinary things when the need arises. And today we’re moving quickly to adapt our routines to meet this challenge. Americans in three states went to the polls today. I want to thank all the public officials and the poll workers who work closely with the public health authorities to assure safe opportunities for voting, to clean and disinfect voting booths and to make sure the voters could cast their ballots while maintaining the distance from one another that was safe. You know, it’s important for us to get through this crisis protecting both the public health and our democracy. And today it looks like once again in Florida and Illinois, we’re still awaiting to hear from Arizona, our campaign has had a very good night. We moved closer to securing the Democratic Party’s nomination for president. And we’re doing it by building a broad coalition that we need to win in November. With strong support from the African American community, the Latino community, high school educated people like the folks I grew up with in my old neighborhood, labor, teachers, suburban women, veterans, firefighters, and so many more. And we’re doing it with a common vision. Senator Sanders and I may disagree on tactics, but we share a common vision for the need to provide affordable healthcare for all Americans, reducing income inequity that has risen so drastically. To tackling the existential threat of our time, climate change. Senator Sanders and his supporters have brought a remarkable passion and tenacity to all of these issues and together they have shifted the fundamental conversation in this country. So let me say, especially to the young voters who have been inspired by Senator Sanders, I hear you, I know what’s at stake. I know what we have to do. Our goal as a campaign and my goal as a candidate for president is to unify this party and then to unify the nation. You know, it’s in moments like these we realize we need to put politics aside and work together as Americans. The coronavirus doesn’t care if you’re a Democrat or Republican. It will not discriminate based on national origin, race, gender, or your zip code. It will touch people in positions of power, as well as the most vulnerable people in our society. We’re all in this together. This is a moment for each of us to see and believe the best in every one of us. To look out for our neighbor, to understand the fear and stress that so many are feeling. To care for the elderly, the elderly couple down the street. To thank the healthcare worker, the doctors, the nurses, the pharmacists, the grocery store cashier, and the people restocking the shelves. To believe in one another. Because I assure you when we do that, when we see the best in each of us, we lift this nation up and we’ll get through this together. That’s how we’ve always done it. God bless you all. And my special prayer for those of you in the front lines of the crisis, doctors, nurses, healthcare workers, caring for the virus victims and their families, my prayers are going out for everyone. My hopes are high because I believe in times of crisis, Americans have always stepped up. We have to step up and care for one another. Thank you all. Thank you all for listening. Oh, thanks, thanks, thanks. Okay."
"45","03-17-21"," … from the Justice Department. So, I’ll have more to say when the investigation is completed. Now, I want to say Happy St. Patrick’s Day to the Taoiseach. It’s good to be good to have you on television. But next year in Washington, next year in Washington. For years, as you know Taoiseach we celebrated this St Patrick’s day. I always put on a breakfast at my home at the Vice President’s residence with leading Irish Americans, your ambassador, our ambassador, as well as some of the prelates who were involved with us. And, it was always a good time. Then we’d go into this very office. You’d sit at a chair over here, the Taoiseach would sit there and I’d sit where my national security advisor is sitting and we’d have a long discussion with the President. And then we’d go up to the United States Capitol where the Speaker of the House, starting with Tip O’Neill, would put on an event as well. And, and then I always snuck over to the Irish Embassy later. I hope we can do that next year. I hope we can do that next year. In the meantime, I want to thank you for the shamrock bowl. I don’t know whether you can see it here? But it’s a great tradition, a custom that goes all the way back to Harry Truman, who I have a bust of Harry Truman over in that corner, I noticed he didn’t move to grab any of the shamrocks. And tonight, Taoiseach, I hope you’ll be able to see that, at least remotely, we’re going to light up the White House in green to celebrate the deep, deep affection that we Americans have, particularly Irish Americans have, for Ireland and the people of Ireland. And it includes millions of Americans like my great, great grandfather and my great-grandfather and my grandfather, all of whom were Irish-Americans on both sides of the family. My grandfather Ambrose Finnegan who was a great football player, American football, and a newspaper man back at the turn of the 20th century, used to always say… Later, when he was much older and I’d walk out of his home, he’d say, “Joey, remember. The best drop of blood in ya is Irish.” I remembered it. I promise you. Because if I didn’t my grandmother Geraldine Blewitt Finnegan would take me down. We have a lot of great memories as well in our family, because one of your predecessors… I’ve been to Ireland many times, but the first time I went to actually go back and look at my roots and meet my family was the last year I was Vice-President United States. And we went both to Mayo where the Blewitts are from and Ballina, the city. And we went to County Louth where the Finnegans are from. It was a great, great opportunity for me to show my grandchildren and children and my brother and sister. I joked at the time, after I left, I wondered why the hell we left in the first place? It’s beautiful. It’s beautiful. And so I think there’s a lot of folks here in Island, my friends from Ireland would always say, “The American-Irish think they’re more Irish than the Irish.” But the truth of the matter is that we have a great affection for their country and a great affection for the tradition. Ireland and the United States have a robust agenda that we’ve got to deal with on the substantive side of this issue, Taoiseach. From combating COVID, to strengthening global health security, to also discussing our economic cooperation and Ireland’s leadership now in the UN Security Council, which were working together. Our UN Ambassador is online with us here. I just welcome the leadership and your partnership. And you know my view and the view of my predecessor, the Obama-Biden administration, on the good Friday agreements. We strongly support them, think it’s critically important that they be maintained. And the political economic stability of Northern Ireland is very much in the interest of all our people, so people-to-people ties. I think the idea that we talked about, about renewing our partnership in the All Ireland Consortium, cancer consortium, the US, Ireland and Northern-Ireland. It’s a partnership that I think we can learn a lot from one another. It’s one of the things that as President, Taoiseach, I am going to focus heavily on with our National Institute of Health on dealing with cancer. We’ve all been victims of it in terms of our families. We all know what it’s like, and we’re going to make major investments in NIH and cancer research and development. And I’m looking forward to working together. As a matter of fact, my relatives in Mayo just dedicated… Loretta, one of my cousins, headed up the hospice effort for cancer… Not just cancer, but hospice in Ireland. And they just dedicated a new significant facility to my son, Beau Biden, who died of cancer. And so everything between Ireland and United States runs deep, Taoiseach. Our joys, our sorrows, our passion, our drive, and our unrelenting optimism and hope. One of the few quotes that I’ve been given credit for in my career was I said… But I’d mean it, maybe it’s just my family. I said, “We Irish are the only people who are nostalgic for the future,” and I think we are. It’s a great opportunity for you and I to get to talk a little bit. So, looking forward to our conversation and I’m looking forward to getting deeper into discussion about some of the things that are of great mutual interest to both of us. As we used to say in the United States Senate, Taoiseach, I yield the floor to you. Thank you very much, indeed. And Mr. President, first of all, on behalf of the Irish people to you I express my condolences to the people of America and indeed the people of Atlanta and to the families of those that were killed in the horrible and very shocking shootings yesterday. And our solidarity is with you and particularly the Asian-American community. We stand together against such mindless acts of violence. I know, Mr. President, St. Patrick’s Day is very special to you as a proud son of Ireland. Equally, I have to tell you, the people of Ireland are so proud of your election as President of the United States of America. And I can think of no better day for me to have the great pleasure to extend to you their warmness and greetings. Thank you. [foreign language 00:07:58] Happy St. Patrick’s Day. Now, as you’ve said it seems strange we have to celebrate apart. As you know well, Irish people love to come together to celebrate our heritage and culture with song, with dance, with parades, with poetry, and with pride. This year because of the pandemic, that simply isn’t possible. Here in Ireland, people are marking the occasion in their homes, but they will be thinking especially of their loved ones around the world and sending them best thoughts and wishes. They will do so in the hope that next year will be better, as I and you believe it will. It will. With each person vaccinated, we moved closer to the day when people can meet each other, hug each other and celebrate again. And I greatly look forward to you being able to visit Ireland as you have done so many times. And as you have said, so memorably before. I also hope it will not be long before I can visit the United States again. For now the Bowl of Shamrock in front of you is a symbol of the undying friendship between our two countries. A symbol of the good times we have shared and the challenges we’ve endured, always I think [inaudible 00:09:21] The green shoots point to the brighter future that I know what lies ahead. The Building Back Better future will, of course, be part of what we discuss today. The policies of our two governments are already closely aligned on the big challenges the world faces. And I look forward to exploring how we can defeat the COVID-19 virus, working together urgently to increase the supply of vaccine for our own people and for people around the world. We should share notes on our plans for recovery, gaining back the ground lost to the pandemic. Both the United States and Europe have put funds of unprecedented scale in place to support this vital work, to build a sustainable and inclusive future, supporting the digital and green agendas, promoting open and fair rules-based trade, delivering greater equality and opportunity. Mr. President, the world has rightly taken great heart from the steps you have already taken to bring the US back to center stage on global health, on climate and on human rights. We want to work with you to promote our shared values and interests in the world, including at the United Nations Security Council on which we are, as you said, currently serving. We want to work with you on climate action which becomes ever more urgent as we approach COP26 later this year. Today, I especially want to thank you for your unwavering support for the Good Friday Agreement. It has meant a lot and it has mattered, including as we negotiated [inaudible 00:11:14]. With a new trading relationship now in place between the European Union and the United Kingdom and the protocol that protects peace and avoids a hard border of this island, I will move forward with a positive relationship with the United Kingdom. That means standing by what has been agreed and working together to make a success of it. And that, in turn then, can maintain peace and promote greater reconciliation on our shared Ireland goals that I know you support. There’s so many areas where the Irish and America people are already working together, and we will celebrate some of them here today. The Consortium through which are practitioners and researchers improve their efforts to defeat cancer, that most pernicious disease. I know it’s very close America in terms of dealing with that. The new initiative to share our poetry and bring it to newer and younger audiences that we will announce today. Mr. President, like you, I am fundamentally an optimist. We have all endured the most difficult year. But, along side the suffering and the loss, we have seen immense compassion, care and courage. Especially from our health workers, our educators and our volunteers. We have seen the world’s best scientists come together to deliver treatments, vaccines and hope at extraordinary pace. And I say that the same spirit of cooperation now speed and guide or recovery in the year ahead. And thank you, Mr. President, I look forward toward to our discussion. I look forward to it as well. We’re going to let the press walk out. [crosstalk 00:13:01]. Thank you. [crosstalk 00:13:13] Mr. [crosstalk 00:13:30] Come on, let’s go."
"46","03-18-21"," I announced in early December about a goal that I set of administering 100 million shots for the virus in the first 100 days of our office. 100 million shots in 100 days. It was considered a ambitious, some even suggested it was somewhat audacious. Experts said the plan was definitely aggressive and distribution would have to be seamless for us to be successful. One headline simply put it, “It won’t be easy.” Well, it wasn’t. When I took office, when we took office, there was a lot that had to be done. We needed more vaccines, more vaccinators, more places for people to get vaccinated, and we needed a whole of government approach. So I directed Jeff Zients the coordinator of our COVID-19 response, to put us on a war footing. And I meant that in a literal sense. To get us on track. To truly beat this virus. I’m proud to announce that tomorrow 58 days into our administration, we will have met my goal of administering 100 million shots to our fellow Americans. That’s weeks ahead of schedule. Even with the setbacks we faced during the winter storms. And there’s another big step, on the path to putting checks in pockets and shots in people’s arms. When we crossed the 50 million doses, just three weeks ago, I told you that every time we hit the 50 million mark, I’d update you on our progress. So here’s where we are today. Eight weeks ago, only 8% of seniors, those most vulnerable to COVID-19 had received a vaccination. Today, 65% of people aged 65 or older have received at least one shot, and 36% are fully vaccinated. That’s key. This is the population that represents 80% of the well over 500,000 COVID-19 deaths that have occurred in America. We have nearly double the amount of vaccine doses that we distribute to states, tribes and territories each week. We have gone from 1 million shots a day, that I promised in December, before we were even sworn in, to an average of two and one half million shots a day, outpacing the rest of the world significantly. Here’s how we accomplish this. Using the power given to a president under the Defense Production Act we expedited critical materials in vaccine production, such as equipment, machinery and supplies. We work with vaccine manufacturers to speed up the delivery of millions more doses, and brokered a historic manufacturing partnership between competing companies who put patriotism and public health first. These steps put us on track to have enough vaccine, enough vaccine supply, for every adult American by the end of May. Months earlier than anyone expected. We stood up or supplied more than 600 community vaccination sites that are administering hundreds of thousands of shots per day. We launched the Federal Pharmacy Program, which has allowed millions of Americans to get a shot at one of 14,000 local pharmacies in this country. The same way they get their flu shot. For folks who aren’t near a pharmacy, or mass vaccination center, we’ve supplied more than 500 mobile clinics, like pop-up sites or vans. Meeting people where they are, meeting people where they are. We deployed, nearly 6,000 federal personnel, including FEMA, active duty military and Department of Health and Human Services to support vaccinations and serve as vaccinators. Putting the needle in people’s arms. We’re also supplying vaccines to community health centers to reach those who have been the hardest hit. The hardest hit and suffered the most, especially black, Latino, Native American and rural communities. This is really important, because we believe that speed and efficiency must be matched with fairness and equity. Now when President Harris and I took a virtual tour of a vaccination center in Arizona, not long ago, one of the nurses on that tour injecting people, giving vaccinations, said that each shot was like administering a dose of hope. A dose of hope. That’s how she phrased it. Behind these 100 million shots are millions of lives changed when people receive that dose of hope. Grandparents can hug their grandchildren again. Frontline workers who can show up at their jobs without the same fear they used to have. Teachers with the confidence to head back into the classroom. These milestones are significant accomplishments, but we have much more to do. Much more to do. And the American Rescue Plan will help us do it. In addition to the cash payments it provides the you and your families, it also provides the funds to add vaccinators, to supply more community vaccination, support more community vaccination centers, and increase testing. It’ll help us accelerate nationwide efforts to reopen our schools safely. As I told the nation last week, I’ve directed all States, tribes and territories to make all adults eligible to be vaccinated no later than May 1st. I’m glad to see that several states are already taking that step to make more and more Americans eligible. Even before May 1st. Tomorrow, we will hit 100 million doses. Our administration has administered, but I’ve always said, that’s just the floor. We will not stop until we beat this pandemic. Next week, I will announce our next goal to put shots in arms. This is a time for optimism, but it’s not a time for relaxation. I need all Americans. I need all of you to do your part. Wash your hands. Stay socially distanced. Keep masking up as recommended by the CDC. And get vaccinated when it’s your turn. Now’s not the time to let down our guard. In the last week we’ve seen increases in the number of cases in several states. Science has made clear that things may get worse as new variants of this virus spread. Getting vaccinated is the best thing we can do to fight back against these variants. While millions of people are vaccinated, we need millions more to be we vaccinated. And again, I need you to get vaccinated when it’s your turn, when you’re able to do that. I need your help. I need you to help, not just the country, but your family, your friends, your neighbors. Get them vaccinated as well. If we keep our guard up, stick together and stick with the science, we can look forward 4th of July that feels a bit more normal. With small groups able to gather for cookouts in backyards. And where we begin to declare our independence on Independence Day from the virus. Look, together we’re going to come through this stronger with renewed faith in each other and our government that fulfills its most important function, protecting the American people. Let me be clear again, wearing this mask in the meantime, making sure you wash your hands, making sure you socially distance and listen to the CDC. We’ve got to reach the point where we have herd immunity. Meaning where we have a vast majority of the American people have been vaccinated before we can stop wearing these. So please, please, don’t let what you see happening in Europe and you see on television. Keep the faith. Keep wearing the mask. Keep washing your hands. And keep socially distanced. We’re going to beat this. We’re way ahead of schedule, but we’ve got a long way to go. I just want to bring you up to date. I thank you very much. May God bless America. May God protect our troops. Thank you so much. Mr. President, Vladimir Putin wants open talks. Would you agree to that? Your reaction to the photo of children in the border detention centers, sir?"
"47","03-19-21"," … we think B117 will be the predominant variant in the U.S probably by the end of March of this month. Now, here in region two, I wanted to share you there’s variability in the regions. Region two includes a New York and New Jersey primarily. In region two we see a pattern where this is wild type being replaced by B117 but here in orange, there’s another variant that’s emerging B526, 1526, and why is this important? Because so you see, and it’s actually a pretty substantial proportion now this particular variant is resistant against one of our monoclonals, one of our drugs that we’re using for therapeutics to treat. So right now we’re discussing within the U.S. government, big U.S. government. Make it clear it’s the therapeutics, not the vaccine. Correct. Because these guys are picking that up. Yeah, that’s right. So it’s a drug, it’s a drug. It’s a drug that’s used early, but even before you go into a hospital, one of these drugs that prevent hospitalization or might prevent death. Please understand I wasn’t correcting you. No, thank you. Dr. [crosstalk 00:01:14] conflate it. No, no, thank you very much. So anyway, this 526 is resistant against one of these monoclonal drugs, and we’re going to give recommendations around changing to separate drugs, maybe combination drugs that will be effective against this particular variant. So I want to end there and we can talk more if you have questions, do you have any questions? Okay. Thank you. So let me turn it over to Dr. Labird. Dr. Thanks Henry. And let me add my welcome to you President Biden and Vice President Harris for being with us in this historic moment in public health. It is such an honor. This will be in our history forever, so thank you for your presence. We observed early in the pandemic that racial and ethnic minority populations were experiencing a disproportionate burden of COVID-19, not only infection, but also severe illness and death. And so, within initial focus on testing and educating communities about COVID-19 and the mitigation measures, last summer, we funded three national organizations to accelerate the dissemination of prevention messages in communities of color. And if you look at the first slide, the organizations were the Asian and Pacific Islander American Health Forum, Proceed Incorporated, which is a National Hispanic & Latino serving organization and the CDC foundation, which allowed us to reach historically Black colleges and universities and other academic institutions. Dr. These organizations were uniquely situated to connect with other national minority organizations with easy access to local community groups that were trusted, and that were longstanding institutions and African American, Hispanic and Latino and Asian American Pacific Islander and Native Hawaiian communities. So by partnering with just three national organizations and tapping into their networks, we were able to reach early on in the pandemic racial and ethnic minority communities in 14 States and you can see that in the second slide. So with the leadership from local organizations, including HBC use, we were able to increase access to testing, help community members understand contact tracing, make available more isolation options, and increase access to health care, particularly through federally qualified community health centers for persons without a regular source of care. Dr. These community partners were able to reach persons, if you look at our third slide, they were able to reach persons with underlying medical conditions, essential and frontline workers in addition to healthcare workers, restaurant and grocery store workers, construction workers, farm workers, and they were able to reach immigrants and migrants, and also to be able to engage early on, faith based organizations. So because of the level of community engagement, there was increased language access by translating materials. And we’ve translated our prevention messages into dozens of languages at this point. And also, by using methods and spokespersons who are known and trusted. Dr. And then the national organizations and the academic partners were there to ensure that the information was both medically and scientifically sound. I’m sure you’re aware that CDC just announced that we will be awarding $2.25 billion to address COVID-19 health disparities and communities at high risk for infection and severe illness. And the lessons that we’ve learned through these projects can be applied to both enhance and accelerate on reducing these disparities and achieving health equity in underserved populations. It is one of the things that caught my attention, I think we talked about this very early on within the first six weeks of the virus becoming aware to everybody and people started to get sick and some of them die. [inaudible 00:05:57] got a call from mayor, a really great guy, a real hard working and fella in Detroit saying to me, “Mr. President, you don’t understand. This is even before,” I wasn’t President then actually, he called me Mr. Vice President. He said, “I don’t think people understand, my community is now about 80% African American and we’re dying and getting sick at a much higher rate than the White community here or any other community. And I brought that up initially, before I put together the group that you’re leading and helping lead, and no one wanted to hear it. And I remember we had trouble getting your predecessors to track it, but what you’re doing really makes a difference. It makes a gigantic difference as the Vice President knows as well or better than anybody. It really, really makes a difference, so thank you. Dr. Thank you. Dr. No, but why y’all standing? That’s the first one. You don’t have to stand for us. Why don’t you sit down, for real. Get comfortable. No, they have chairs. That’s the first question, and the second question is why did only one person clap? I don’t know. You know what I mean? [inaudible 00:07:25] do this as the doc knows, you’re all too serious here. We owe you a gigantic debt of gratitude and we will for a long, long, long time, because I hope this is the beginning of the end of not paying attention to what’s going to come again and again and again, and again. We can build all the walls we want, we can most powerful armies in the world but we cannot stop, we cannot stop these viruses other than be aware of where they are and move quickly on them when we find them. And the one thing that I, the reason I am so, so happy to have been able to, anyway, to have doc here is that science is back. All kidding aside. Think about it. For the longest time, not just as it relates to the CDC, but science. Science was viewed as an appendage to anything else we were talking about, but it’s back. And I just want you to have some confidence that not only are the Vice President I and the whole team and the whole COVID team at large committed, but the American people have moved. The American people have moved. This is a bipartisan effort now. Now it isn’t showing itself in the way senators and Congressman vote, but the public, the public, we were talking about it on the airplane. The public in a bipartisan way, when I came up with this $1.9 billion for this whole COVID and the economic relief side of it as well, we were told that it could never pass and we’d never get any help. Well, we didn’t get any help in the Senate or the house, but you have 55% of the Republicans in America supporting it. You have 90 something percent of the Democrats, 80 something … The point is the public is thankful to you because it’s about science. That’s what they understand. They understand. And we’re not going back to the old days, even if tomorrow the whole administration changed, I think you’ve changed things. You’ve changed them in a way that are going to make everybody healthier in this country. And when we have a crisis, you’re prepared to meet it because you speak truth and science to power and that is the power. So all the folks listening, I guess you said there’s hundreds if not thousands of people listening. Yes. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. There’s an entire generation coming up that is learning from what you’ve done. I don’t just mean learning about how to deal with the virus, learning about it makes a difference to tell the truth, to follow the science and just wherever it takes you and just be honest about it and that’s what you’ve all done. So we owe you a debt of gratitude of all the lives you’ve saved. I carry in my pocket, the doc knows my schedule. On the back of my schedule, I have listed every single day with the exact number of people who have died from COVID the day before. I mean, for cumulative. We’re at 535,217 dead as of yesterday, last night. It’s got to stop, but you’re slowing it, it’s stopping. And it really, really matters. That’s more people that have died, Americans, in all of World War I, World War II, the Vietnam War and 9/11 combined, combined. In a year, in a year. And you are the army. You’re the Navy. You’re the Marines. You’re the Coast Guard. I really mean it. This is a war and you are the front line troops. It sounds silly to say it that way, it sounds grand, but think about it. Finally, we got the vaccines, we got the companies together and then they didn’t have the wherewithal to be able to produce all the vaccines. So there’s a thing called the Defense Production Act, as President I’m allowed to enforce it. So I had people saying, “Making that and start making these.” We finally put together, did you ever think you’d see the day because you’ve all been involved in medicine, see two major drug companies cooperate for the good of the country? One come up with a drug and the other say, “Well, we’ll manufacture it for you?” So what you’re doing really, really, really matters. Not only, and I’ll end with this, not only in saving lives, but changing the mindset of the country. Changing the mindset of the country and it’s affected everything, not just affected people’s health, it’s affected their attitude. The attitude about what we can do as a country. Everybody thought that I was … they didn’t quite understand when I announced that we had over 100 million shots in less than … You remember when I said, “My goal was to have 100 million shots in people’s arms in the first 100 days as president.” And everybody said, “Oh, yeah right.” Now it’s, “It should have been more. Why didn’t they say more?” You know what I mean? But here’s the point. The point is that it is changing the way we look at a whole range of things. And when I announced it, everybody but the Vice President wondered why I also pointed out that we landed a rover on Mars at the same time, because this is the United States of America for God’s sake. There is nothing, nothing, nothing we cannot do when we do it together and that’s what you’re showing everybody. So I came to say thank you. I really mean it. I have a whole lot of nice notes on here about the science, but I came here to say thank you, because you’re not only changing the psyche of the country, you’re saving lives, you’re saving lives but you’re changing the psyche of the country. And this is as I said, I don’t think we’re being a chauvinistic think about our country, but think about it. We’re the only country in the world that is every time we’ve gone into a crisis have come out stronger immediately after the crisis then when we went in before the crisis, think about it. [inaudible 00:14:15] who we are. Closing comment. [inaudible 00:14:20] Xi Jinping in China, I spent more time with him I’m told than any world leader, because he was Vice President and I was Vice President. His President and mine wanted us to get to know one another because it was clear he was going to become the President. I traveled 17,000 miles with him in China and in the United States and in Asia generally, and met with him, I guess they tell me 24, 25 hours alone just me and an interpreter and he had an interpreter. And by the way, I handed in all my notes. Minor point. But all kidding aside, he asked me on the Tibetan plateau. [inaudible 00:15:00] said to me, “Can you define America for me?” And I said, “Yeah, in one word,” and I mean it, one word, “possibilities, possibilities.” Which you guys believe in. Possibilities based on science and hard data. And so, I just thank you for not only your intellectual skills, but your heart. Your heart, your determination. Thank you, thank you, thank you. And I shouldn’t have done that because I want to yield to my Vice President whose smarter than I am. Well, there’s not much to add to that, Mr. President. I’m so sorry. But I will say that I do believe that this administration with the leadership of our President is without any question about science and everyone here knows before the President was President he was dedicated to science, the moonshot. And my mother was a scientist. The first job I had, little known fact was cleaning pipettes in her lab. I was awful, she fired me. And then there was this moment of global crisis. And the President takes calls with leaders around the world, we talk with people around the world and they have named their centers of disease control after this center of disease control. They put their name of their country and they call it the CDC. Dr. That’s right. You are a model for the world around what can be done based on a pursuit of that, which will uplift and improve human condition in life, and you guys do this work around the clock. And so, we are here to say thank you because it’s not easy, you’re making difficult decisions right now, some of the most difficult, but you’re making those decisions based on science, based on hard work and based on a commitment to the public health and therein lies part of the nobility of your work. You do this work on behalf of people you will never meet. On behalf of people who will never know your names because you care about our country and their wellbeing, so we are here to thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so very much. Thank you for your visit. Thank you for reinvigorating us. I can promise you as long as this team of people are here, as long as I am here, we will bake into the cake of everything we do our commitment to equity, to science, and to bring back the health for the American people and to keep it back. Thank you very much. I don’t have any doubt about that. If you all don’t learn to sit, you’re never to make it. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you. I think so. All right. Thanks everybody. Thank you again."
"48","03-23-21"," There’s still a great deal we don’t know about the killer and the motivation of the killer in Boulder, Colorado, and other critical aspects of this mass shooting. I’ve been briefed this morning by the Attorney General of the United States, the Director of the FBI. I’ve spoken with the governor and I’ll be speaking with the mayor on the aircraft. We’re working very closely with the state and local law enforcement officials and they’re going to keep me updated as they learn more. You’re going to ask me to speculate, understandably. You ask me to speculate about what happened, why it happened, and I’m not going to do that now because we don’t have all the information, not until I have all the facts. But I do know this, as president, I’m going to use all the resources at my disposal, to keep the American people safe. As I said at this moment, a great deal remains unknown but three things are certain. First, 10 lives have been lost and more families have been shattered by gun violence in the state of Colorado and Jill and I are devastated and the feeling, I just can’t imagine how the families are feeling; the victims whose futures were stolen from them, from their families, from their loved ones who now have to struggle to go on and try to make sense of what’s happened. Less than a week after the horrific murders of eight people and the assault on the AAPI community in Georgia, while the flag was still flying half-staff for the tragedy and other American cities been scarred by gun violence and resulting trauma and a state that I even hate to say it, because we were saying so often, my heart goes out. Our hearts go out for the survivors, who had to had to flee for their lives and who hid, terrified, unsure if they would ever see their families again, their friends again. The consequences of all this are deeper than I suspect we know. By that I mean, the mental consequences, the feeling of… Anyway, it just… Through too many of these. The second point I want to make is my deepest thanks to the heroic police and other first responders who acted so quickly to address the situation and keep the members of our community safe. To state the obviously… The obvious, I commend the exceptional bravery of Officer Eric Talley. I send my deepest condolences to his family; his close, close family of seven children. You know, when he pinned on that badge yesterday morning, he didn’t know what the day would bring and want everybody to think about this. Every time an officer walks out of his or her home and pins that badge on, the family member that they just said goodbye to, wonders whether they’ll subconsciously, will they get that call; the call that his wife got. He thought he’d be coming home to his family and his seven children. When the moment the act came, officer Talley did not hesitate in his duty, making the ultimate sacrifice, in his effort to save lives. That’s a definition of an American hero. And thirdly, I want to be very clear. This is the one thing I do know enough to say on in terms of what’s happened there. While we’re still waiting for more information regarding the shooter, his motive, the weapons he used, the gun, the magazines, the weapons, the modifications that apparently have taken place to those weapons that are involved here. I don’t need to wait another minute, let alone an hour, to take common sense steps or save the lives in the future and to urge my colleagues in the House and Senate to act. We can ban assault weapons and high capacity magazines in this country, once again. I got that done when I was a Senator. It passed. It was a law for the longest time and it brought down these mass killings. We should do it again. We can close the loopholes in our background check system, including the Charleston loophole. That’s one of the best tools we have right now to prevent gun violence. The Senate should immediately pass, let me say it again. The United States Senate, I hope some are listening, should immediately pass the two house past bills that close loopholes in the background check system. These are bills that received votes of both Republicans and Democrats in the House. This is not, it should not be a partisan issue. This is an American issue. It will save lives, American lives, and we have to act. We should also ban assault weapons in the process. I’ll have much more to say as we learn more but I wanted to be clear. Those poor folks who died, left behind families. It leaves a big hole in their hearts and we can save lives, increasing the background checks so they’re supposed to occur and eliminating assault weapons and the size of magazines. We don’t know all the detail yet on that but I’ll be talking to me more later today or the next couple of days about what else we know. May God bless you all and those families who are mourning today because they’re gun violence in Colorado and Georgia, all across the country. We have to act so there’s more of you, there’s fewer of you, as time goes on. Thank you so much. Will you introduce new gun legislation, Mr. President?"
"49","03-24-21"," Today I have a two announcements to make. One is we got ourselves a secretary. Xavier, welcome. Thank you, Mr President. Thanks for being willing to do this. I really appreciate it. Also today, I said when we became a team and got elected that the Vice President is going to be the last person in the room. She didn’t realize that means she gets every assignment. But the Vice President and I, and all of us here, have been working very hard to pass the legislation that is going to beat this virus as well as get people back to work and change their prospects. So she’s traveling all over the country working that. In addition to that there’s about five other major things she’s handling, but I’ve asked her, the VP today, because she’s the most qualified first to do it, to lead our efforts with Mexico and the Northern Triangle and the countries that are going to need help in stemming the movement of so many folks, stemming the migration to our southern border. Back when I was Vice President, I got a similar assignment, but one of the things we did was we made sure that we got a bipartisan agreement with Democrats and Republicans to provide over $700 million to the countries in the Northern Triangle to determine the best way to keep people from coming, and just keep them from wanting to leave. The reason why so many people were leaving, we learned, was that not only gang violence and trafficking cartels, but natural disasters, hurricanes, floods, earthquakes. So it’s not like someone sits around a Hanuman table somewhere in Guatemala and says, “I got a great idea. Let’s sell everything we have, give the money to a coyote, have them take our kids or us to the border of America, take us across, leave us in a desert. We don’t speak the language. One of the ways we learned is that if you deal with the problems in country, it benefits everyone. It benefits us, it benefits the people and grows the economies there. Unfortunately, the last administration eliminated that funding, did not engage in it, did not use it, even though there was over $700 million to help get this done. We’re reinstituting that program. As I said, there are many factors as to why people leave in the first place. This is the source of one of the reasons why we’ve had such a… Before we took office, in the midst of the last administrations somewhat draconian policies of separating children from their parents, et cetera, what happened was that we found that there were serious spike in the number of people heading to the southern border, even in the midst of that. As Alejandro can tell you, that was because there were serious natural disasters that occurred in those countries. They were coming north and we did nothing to do much about it. So this new surge we’re dealing with now starting with the last administration, but it’s our responsibility to deal with it humanely and to stop what’s happening. So this increase has been consequential, but the Vice President’s agreed, among the multiple other things that have [inaudible 00:04:14] and I appreciate it, agreed to lead our diplomatic effort and work with those nations to accept the returnees and enhance migration enforcement at their borders, at their borders. We’re already talking with Mexico about that, she’s already done that. We’re going to be dealing with a full team now that we have to be able to deal with the problem here at home, but also to deal with it now in terms of in country. And I can think of nobody who’s better qualified to do this than the former… This is a woman who ran the second largest Attorney General’s office in America after the United States Attorney General in the State of California, and has done a great deal of [inaudible 00:05:05] human rights, but also fighting organized crime in the process. It’s not her full responsibility to job, but she’s leading the effort because I think the best thing to do is to put someone who, when he or she speaks, they don’t have to wonder about is that where the President is. When she speaks, she speaks for me, doesn’t have to check with me. She knows what she’s doing, and I hope we can move this along. So madam Vice President, thank you. I gave you a tough job and you’re smiling, but there’s no one better capable of trying to organize it. Well, thank you, Mr President, and for having the confidence in me. There is no question that this is a challenging situation. As the President has said, there are many factors that lead precedence to leave these countries. While we are clear that people should not come the border now, we also understand that we will enforce the law and that we also, because we can chew gum and walk at the same time, must address the root causes that that caused people to make the trek, as the President has described, to come here. And I look forward to engaging in diplomacy with government, with private sector, with civil society and the leaders of each in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras to strengthen democracy and the rule of law and ensure shared prosperity in the region. We will collaborate with Mexico and other countries throughout the western hemisphere. As part of this effort, we expect that we will have collaborative relationships to accomplish the goals the President has and that we share. I also look forward to working with members of the Congress, who I think share our perspective on the need to address root causes for the migration that we’ve been seeing. Needless to say, the work will not be easy, but it is important work. It is work that we demand and the people of our countries, I believe, need to help stem the tide that we’ve seen. So thank you, Mr President for your confidence. Well, thank you for being willing to do it. Now we’re going to get down to business here. Thank you very much, Mr President. I think it’s time for our friends in the press to leave though. [inaudible 00:07:30]. Thank you very much."
"50","03-25-20"," All across the board to serve our country, whether it’s by joining the military, becoming doctors, teachers, nurses, public servants, by volunteering in their communities or nonprofits, and through remarkable testament to the spirit and feeling of connection to our larger world. Today, a new group of young people referred to as Generation Z is growing up in a time of pervasive anxiety about school shootings, crushing debt, and politics that seems unresponsive or broken beyond repair. Now students from grade school to college are being denied months of important milestones and experiences because of this pandemic. No spring semester, no spring break, no championship games, no year end concerts, no graduations, and they didn’t do anything wrong. But especially for those just entering adulthood or launching their careers, job opportunities, their dreams, their dreams are being snatched away. Look, none of us want to be cooped up in our homes just as the weather is turning nice, just as spring break travel plans were approaching, just as the campaign for the presidency is kicking into high gear. It’s unfair to all of us and it’s unnecessary for all of us, but it’s necessary in fact. It’s necessary for all of us to have to deal with it. We have to stay home because we can transmit live viruses to other people before we feel the signs of sickness ourselves. We all have to behave as though we’re already infected. But based on recent data from the Center for Disease Control, all adults, including young adults need to practice social distancing, self isolation for their own personal protection as well. And in the cases in the US thus far, almost 40% of the COVID-19 infections have required hospitalization. They are among people who are aged 20 to 54. People under the age of 60 are not immune to the coronavirus. Young people are not assured to only experience a mild case if you catch it. There are no guarantees that you’ll not die from it. Every day we’re hearing heartrending stories of deaths from people in their 20s and their 30s. That’s why we have to follow the CDC guidelines, to minimize the risk of our own exposure to the virus and to slow its spread to others. And I have no doubt, I have no doubt that all of us, including the younger generation, younger people, are going to step up and make the sacrifices of a few weeks or even a few months for our normal lives to be able to return, in order to beat this virus because this is who we are. That’s the spirit that has defined America. We see it in the millions of young people who are working every day to make their communities better, serving others, teaching kids to read, feeding hungry families, mowing the lawn or they’re buying groceries for the elderly neighbor next door, but here’s what we must not do. We must not allow this pandemic to rob our young people of the futures and the economic opportunities that they’ve been working so hard to build. We need to make sure that our economic recovery does not come at the expense of those who can least afford it, or who are just getting started in life. These are twin crises. The public health crisis is hitting older Americans especially hard. The economic crisis is hitting younger people. All those hardworking young people in service, [inaudible 00:03:53] and retail that are being decimated by layoffs. All those who are hustling to make a living in the gig economy. They deserve the same benefits as everyone else does. We have to make sure they get them. All those who were already struggling to get by before this crisis occurred, they’re the ones we should be focusing on, who are drowning in credit card debt and student loans are now in even greater need for a lifeline. The United States Senate just passed or didn’t pass, just reached an agreement on a $2 trillion support bill to provide critical relief for people and some stability for our economy, the largest in our history. Democrats did significant work to make sure that working families get critical help now. This is a moment where speed matters. This bill can keep workers on payrolls. That’s huge. It also offers significant additional support for unemployment insurance, and it’ll go a long way to provide the financial lifeline for middle income folks. If the people who were left out are brought back in and covers those people often get left out; the self-employed, the gig workers, the folks who lost their jobs even before this crisis hit. It also includes several key pieces that I’ve been advocating for. One is a fund to support states localities as they address the crisis. I think we have to talk more about that later. Money to support our hospitals and healthcare workers, vital support for small businesses, and important oversight, this is critical, important oversight for the $500 billion loan package for corporations. But implementing this bill is going to take a whole lot of flyspecking, a whole lot of work. It’s going to require meticulous oversight on a day to day basis. It’s going to take a lot of coordination with state and local governments. That’s what we had to do when I was in charge of executing the Recovery Act, which was $900 billion over that. That’s how we made sure the funds weren’t wasted or abused. Every single day I was on the phone with leaders in each of the states and localities going through the detail of what they had to do. We’re going to need to make sure the money gets out quickly into people’s pockets and to keep a close watch on how corporations are using the taxpayer’s funds that they receive. To make sure it goes to helping workers, not enrich CEOs or shareholders. And then we have to figure out what to do to help the folks this bill leaves out including young people. This bill doesn’t include student loan forgiveness, which would go a long way to providing an immediate relief for those who need it the most. I support forgiving at least $10000 in student loan debt per person now. It doesn’t include the cost-free treatment for the COVID-19, whatever the costs are relating to that. It should be cost free, or fully paid sick leave for all our workers, which is also critical for the millions of Americans, including so many young Americans around the front lines of fighting this virus to get us through this. Doctors, nurses, delivery drivers, grocery store stockers, first responders, cleaning crews. They’ve been in the margins of our economy for much too long, not being paid enough, not having the benefits they deserve, and they’re all answering the call to duty now in a moment of national need, and they deserve leadership that will do the same. We need to get more fiscal relief to states on the front lines like New York State. Donald Trump downplayed the seriousness of this crisis for weeks and he continues to delay the mobilization of the national resources to deliver lifesaving equipment for our doctors, our nurses, our frontline workers. And as a result, this virus will hit all of us harder than it otherwise might have hit us, and it’s going to take us longer to recover. Now he suggested that he wants to get the country opened, back opened by Easter. Look, we all want to get back to normal as quickly as possible, but we have a lot to do to make that possible. We have to do it in a smart way to not meet some arbitrary or symbolic timeline. And it would be a catastrophic thing to do for our people and for our economy if we sent people back to work just as we were beginning to see the impact of social distancing take hold, only to unleash the second spike in infections. A thought out strategy, supported by science and scientists, to get Americans back to work because the only way we’ll fully solve the economic challenges is by first solving the public health crisis. Let me say that again. The only way we’re going to be able to do that is by solving the public health crisis first. Look, we’re going to get through this, and we’re going to get through it together. I know we will. The capacity of Americans, fueled by our young people, is boundless. We’re going to rely on the energy, the innovative spirit of Millennials and Generation Z to help rebuild our economy when this is over, and it will be. We need a leader in the White House who’s going to help spur this progress, spur our progress, all of us. Empower the next generation of leaders to seize our future of possibilities, not to drag us backwards. Later today, I’ll be participating in a digital round table with young people so that we can continue to have a real discussion about the issues that matter to our future, and they do matter to our future. Now I’m happy to answer some questions you all may have. I know there’s a lot more to say, but I’ll be doing this on a regular basis, so thank you, and I’m open to questions. Thank you. Great. Our first question, will go to Jen Epstein from Bloomberg News. Jen, you are unmuted. Okay, thank you. Hi, Mr. Vice President. Hey, Jennifer. Good. Thanks. At home, like everyone else. Me too. I’d urge them to think about the science; not the science of Wall Street, the science of medicine. What is it that is going to get us to a place where it’s safe for people to go back to work and be interacting in a way that we did in the past rather than set some arbitrary date? I understand the reason why we want to move. There’s a lot of ways we can move if we implement what the Senate is about to pass. We’re going to have to do more. I hope the Senate passes what we’re about to do, or what they’ve said and the House. But we’re going to have to do more beyond that. There’s a way to infuse into the economy, the ability of people to be stable and, when this is over, to be able to come back in full bore. But the idea of arbitrarily setting a time, I’d like to be able to say we’re going to be back to normal next Friday. That’d be wonderful, but it can’t be arbitrary. We’ve got to look at the history of what’s happened, the recent history of what’s happened in other countries. We saw what it takes to get this under control, and we still don’t have all the answers. The bottom line is listen to the docs, listen to the researchers, listen to the infectious disease specialist. If we don’t do that, we’re going to find ourselves in a position where we’re going to be worse off at the end of the day economically than if we went back too quickly. There are certain places, I’m confident, you’d be able to open up more access and being able to be less confined. But that’s going to be on a case-to-case basis. But the idea of the whole economy being back to, I can’t fathom New York City being in that situation or New Orleans or other places that we’re going to see a real increase shortly. But the science, let the science dictate that outcome. Next up, you have Gabe Fisher from Wake Up to Politics. Hi, Mr. Vice President. Thank you. Hey, Gabe. Yes. Well, first of all, this is about, what I’m talking about today is making sure that your generation, I’m assuming you’re somewhere between 18 and 30. 18. 18. That your generation doesn’t end up behind the eight ball because you get hurt by this so badly you can’t ever, when you get out of school, be able to move. For example, I strongly believe there’s a need for us to, as it relates to the help that’s needed now to for the economy and your generation is, I think there should be a $10,000 forgiveness of student loans across the board for anyone who is in fact affected now from this point on, as we fight this pandemic. When we fund money, we find money to do that. Number two, I think it’s vitally important that we have a healthcare proposal, that’s why I’m strongly arguing that this administration drop their attempt to do away in court with Obamacare, and we build on Obamacare immediately to be able to provide for all the economic impact that is going to be required from a healthcare system that people don’t have to bear that themselves. It can be paid for and they know how to. They know it’s going to be paid for. Thirdly, we’re going to have an opportunity, I believe, in the next round here to use my a green economy, my green deal, or to be able to generate both economic growth and consistent with the kind of infusion of monies we need into the system to keep it going. One of the ways to make sure these jobs are available that may get lost or hurt in the meantime is to provide the kind of jobs that are prevailing wages where people are making 45, 50 dollars an hour plus benefits by building new infrastructure. We’re going to need new infrastructure going down the road here and it’s a way to generate economic growth. That’s going to be, I think, the next round we have to be looking at. In addition to that, I think it’s really important we take a look at what it is that is going to allow you to be in a position that you can in fact be in a position to live a gainful life. I’ve said for a long time, if we were setting up an education system for the first time in our history, as we did in the late 1800s, we would not say 12 years was enough. 12 years is not enough to live in the second quarter of the middle of the 21st Century and be able to live and know you’re going to be able to compete. Right now you have a significant number of jobs requiring six out of 10 jobs requiring more than a high school education just to get the jobs that were there before this coronavirus hit. I think that we should provide not only for post-high school, but pre-grade school. I think we should be tripling the amount of money we provide for school districts that I have low-income bases, Title I schools from 15 to 45 billion dollars a year. That would allow teacher pay to go up because your generation and the one between you and the people that are up to 45, they’re not going in or staying in education anymore. They can’t compete. They graduate magna cum laude from a great university with an education degree, they get paid somewhere about 22% less to start than anybody else except a social worker. What we have to do is we have to increase teacher’s pay at the front end to keep people from the schools from having to, we already have a shortage of 115,000 teachers right now. By 2025, it’ll be about a quarter of a million, and that just means more difficulty in terms of reaching children so they can reach their potential. Secondly, we would be able to put every single child age three, four, and five in school; not daycare, school. All the studies at the great universities show that increases by well over 50% their prospects of going all the way through high school and beyond by over 56%. It’s a smart investment now. At the tail end, I’ve been proposing that we have free college, excuse me, free community college education. I’ve fought for spending $ 70 billion on HBCUs over the next 10 years. … and $70 billion on HBCUs over the next 10 years. And in addition to that, I think if you’re going to a public university in your state, it should be free, free for everyone. That’s how it should be, and you should not end up with some gigantic debt like my kids did when they graduated. And so the circumstances are across the board, but mostly we have to prepare you so you’re not carrying an overwhelming burden, that when you get out of school, when you go through… And not just going to college, trade schools and the whole deal, because we have to reach out more. There are a lot of jobs out there that are going to be available in the near term that in fact people aren’t equipped for. And there’s more, but we also should be talking about anyone who in fact has a student debt, if in fact they’re engaged in public service, teaching school, joining a volunteer’s organization to provide food and shelter for people, across the board, that they get forgiven, past debt or debt, that they would incur, $10,000 per year up to $50,000. That would cover virtually everyone. Now, if you have seven years of private school debt, college debt, then it’s not going to cover that, but it will get a big chunk of it. And the other thing we do is, there’s a lot of students, and I hope you’re not part of it because it’s more of a disadvantage, who come from a circumstance where their families have less than $50,000 in income. Well, Barack and I, President Obama, increased Pell Grants in terms of the amount of money you get for a Pell Grant, I would make sure that we double the Pell Grant funding, so that is not enough to give a free tuition to someone if they can’t get there, if they can’t eat, if they had no place to sleep, no room and board in effect. And so I double Pell Grants to $ 12,000 a year. And then there are things beyond that are going to affect your generation a lot. I think we should be putting $50 billion in heavy research through NIH on dealing with the big killers, diabetes, Alzheimer’s and cancer. And so there’s a lot we can do. When I left the United States Senate, I became a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and I’ve spent a lot of time, and the University of Delaware has the Biden School there as well. So I spent a lot of time on campus with college students, but it’s not just college students, it’s those hardworking kids getting out of school that in fact, high school, that aren’t going to college or don’t want to go to college and want to go to trade school, we got to equip them. I know I’m taking a long time and answering this, but I think it’s really important. We don’t want you saddled the way the generation after 911 and after the economic downturn in 2008 got saddled. Thank you for your time. Thank you for your question. Great. Next up we have Alexandra Jaffe from AP. Hi, Mr. Vice President. I have two quick ones for you. One, you’ve been speaking about your outreach to congressional leadership and I was wondering if you could share a little bit more details on that. Well, I’m not suggesting what the public sees about his leadership. Let me take the last question first. What I’m suggesting is that I know what has to be done and that in the following: that faster is better than slower. For example, way back in January 17th I argued that this virus was coming. I did a, I think it was US News and World Report, I did a piece on saying it’s coming. We’ve got to prepare. We didn’t do much at all, number one. Number two, I think it’s really important that we understand that this idea of this Defense Production Act, he talks about signing, he doesn’t want to dictate to companies. There’s things we need now, now, not tomorrow, not yesterday, but months ago or a month ago, and the president’s not acting. Now, I don’t care whether the president’s numbers are going up and down. I know along with everybody else whose ever dealt with these kinds of things, like we did in our administration, that time is of the essence. Time is of the essence, and so that’s the last part of your question. And yes, I have been talking to governors, mayors, congressional leaders as well as members of Congress and I’ve been doing three things. One, asking their input, what they’re seeing, what they’re dealing with, what their problems are, particularly with regard to the governors and the mayors. And two, asking members of the House and Senate what they think is the most important elements that they think have to be included in the legislation. And three, then when asked, and I’ve been asked, offering what I think should be part of it, but I’m not second guessing it here in the sense that I’m no longer in the Senate obviously, but there are things that I think that we should be doing more of, but I think the Democrats in the Senate got as much of what needs to be done in as they could possibly get. We can’t wait a lot longer. We’re going to need to come back at this. We’re going to have to come back at this and deal with, focus on those state and local aid that is going to be needed as this crisis continues, and is needed now. I think we should be employing right now, the legislation that’s available to the president in emergencies. He said he’s a wartime president. Well, act like one. There’s things you can do right now to make sure all those ventilators get out, to make sure that those masks are there, to make sure… For example, I would even think about the idea is… I’ll conclude with this, but I was asked to manage the $900 billion Recovery Act in 18 months, which we did manage and it got out. I think most people would say it’s saved us from going into a depression, and that it was done, but it required day to day oversight with one person in charge. The president asked me to be in charge. I was able to text… or not text. I was able to task the entire administration to work for me. But we were on the phone with every governor, most every mayor, there was one governor, all 49 governors, put it that way. And what happened was that they’d have ideas, “Well, how can I use the money? I want to do this.” “Well, no, you can’t do that. You’ve got to do this.” “Well, I think under the law I can do that.” And I’d say, “Well, if you’re going to go ahead and do that, I’m going to come out and tell the public and I’m going to hold a press conference saying, ‘I think you used the money unwisely.'” And you have to have someone watching it every day, and I had a full time staff with me of serious, serious people doing nothing but manage this day to day. And that’s what’s going to have to happen. For example, let’s take a look at what’s going to happen here in terms of getting out small business loans. Well, there’s money in here for small business loans. Well, banks traditionally aren’t real big on dealing with and have the personnel to deal with small business loans. So it could take a long time to get that done. But that’s the single most urgent need we have. And so if banks are not able to handle that, if I were president, I would be in fact using the wartime legislation to insist that they focus on that. That’s much more important in terms of economic recovery than anything else we’re doing in addition to aid to the states. So it’s all about urgency. And I noticed that the president’s numbers of the public have gone up in handling this crisis, but they haven’t gone up in terms of his presidency. Gallup did show he is now at 49% job approval, which is a reversal from a few weeks ago. So it’s just an interesting development. It does suggest that the American people see him as a stronger leader than you’ve been maybe characterizing him. Well, I hope that he’s so strong that he’s up way above that because we need the help now. We need help now. Great. Thank you. We have time for one more question, Arlette from CNN. Hi, Vice President Biden. Hello, Arlette. Arlette from CNN. Hello Arlette. I have two quick questions for you. You talked about your conversations that you’ve had with lawmakers here in the US. Have you had any conversations with foreign leaders given your existing relationships with them about the coronavirus? And secondly, Bernie Sanders’ campaign has said that he would debate if there was a debate in April. My focus is just dealing with this crisis right now, I haven’t thought about any more debates. I think we’ve had enough debates, I think we should get on with this. But with regard to speaking to foreign leaders, I haven’t spoken with a foreign leader in the last probably two weeks. I talked about how it affected their country, but no, I’m not going to … It was an off the record discussion I had, so I’m not going to indicate who. And do you have any concerns about breaking throughout all of this coronavirus coverage, the news cycle? I mean, this is the first time that there is a real public crisis that you haven’t been in office with decision making authority. Well, I was, but I’m finding out that what you’ve mastered along before me that the new technologies are quite effective. For example, I noticed that when I laid out my plan a couple days, three days ago or four days ago that it didn’t get covered on the national nets, but I found out 3.8 million people watched it online. So I’m learning a lot more about how to get the message out in terms of beyond what we’re doing. As a matter of fact, I think we’re both sitting in our own homes with, I don’t know, are you in the studio? Are you at home? Well, anyway, I’m at home. They had to set up, it took about four days to be able to have the power and the capacity to set up in my recreation room where I’m sitting now the ability to communicate like I am now. So I think there’s plenty of opportunity to communicate. But I have to tell you, I find, I guess like anybody who cares about this, I’m chomping at the bit. I wish I were still in the Senate being able to impact on some of these things. But I am where I am, and I hope to be the nominee of the Democratic Party, and I hope I’m able to get my message across as we go forward. But my main focus, believe it or not, is not a political focus. My main focus now is to make sure we handle this crisis well so we’re not left with a legacy and a whole lot of dead weight we have to carry through the next 10 years. Great. Thank you. That concludes our press briefing. As always, please feel free to reach out to our press team and have a great rest of your day. Thank you. That’s you all."
"51","03-25-21"," Please, please sit down. Thank you. Thank you. Good afternoon. Before I take questions, I want to give you a progress report to the nation on where we stand 65 days into office here on vaccinations and a few other top priorities for the American people. First on vaccinations. On December 8th, I indicated that I hoped to get 100 million shots in people’s arms in my first 100 days. We met that goal last week by day 58, 42 days ahead of schedule. Now, today I’m setting a second goal and that is, we will, by my 100th day in office, have administered 200 million shots in people’s arms. That’s right, 200 million shots in 100 days. I know it’s ambitious, twice our original goal, but no other country in the world has even come close, not even close to what we are doing. And I believe we can do it. And today, we made a historic investment in reaching the hardest hit and the most vulnerable communities, the highest risk communities as a consequence of the virus by investing an additional $10 billion in being able to reach them. I also set a goal before I took office of getting a majority of schools in K through Eight fully open in the first 100 days. Now, thanks to the enormous amount of work done by our administration, educators, parents, local, state education officials and leaders, a recent Department of Education survey shows that nearly half of the K through Eight schools are open now full-time, five days a week for in-person learning. Not yet a majority, but we’re really close, and I believe in the 35 days left to go, we’ll meet that goal as well. As, of yesterday, more than 100 million payments of $1,400 have gone into people’s bank accounts. That’s real money in people’s pockets, bringing relief instantly almost. And millions more will be getting their money very soon. One final note, since we passed the American Rescue Plan, we’re starting to see new signs of hope in our economy. Since it was passed, a majority of economic forecasters have significantly increased their projections on the economic growth that’s going to take place this year. They’re now projecting it will exceed 6%, a 6% growth in GDP. And just this morning, we learned that the number of people filing for weekly unemployment insurance fell by nearly 100,000 persons. This is the first time in a year the number’s fallen below the pre-pandemic high. So there are still too many Americans out of work, too many families hurting, and they still have a lot of work to do. But I can say to you, the American people, help is here and hope is on the way. Now, I’ll be happy to take your questions. Zeke at the Associated Press. Thank you, Mr. President. You mentioned your progress on COVID-19. I’d like to ask you about some of the other issues facing your Presidency. One of the defining challenges you face in the coming months is how to deliver on your promise to Americans on issues like immigration reform, gun control, voting rights, climate change. All of those right now are facing stiff united opposition from Republicans on Capitol Hill. Well, look, when I took office, I decided that it was a fairly basic simple proposition, and that is, I got elected to solve problems and the most urgent problem facing the American people I stated from the outset was COVID-19 and the economic dislocation for millions and millions of Americans. And so that’s why I put all my focus in the beginning, there were a lot of problems, but all my focus on dealing with those particular problems. And the other problems we’re talking about from immigration to guns and the other things you mentioned are longterm problems. They’ve been around a long time, and what we’re going to be able to do, God willing, is now began one at a time to focus on those as well, and whether it’s immigration or guns or a number of other problems that face the country. But the fundamental problem is getting people some peace of mind so they can go to bed at night and not stare at the ceiling, wondering where they lost their health insurance, whether they’re going to lose some family member, whether they’re going to be in a position where they’re going to lose their home, because they can’t pay their mortgage, or the millions of people who are going to get thrown out of their homes because of the inability to pay the rent. So we’re going to move on these one at a time, try to do as many simultaneously as we can, but that’s the reason why I focused as I have. And here’s the deal, I think my Republican colleagues are going to have to determine whether or not we want to work together or they decide that the way in which they want to proceed is to just decide to divide the country, continue the politics of division. But I’m not going to do that. I’m just going to move forward and take these things as they come. A follow-up, Mr. President. Well, I plan on making progress on all of them, but that’s going to be for the American people to decide. I doubt whether maybe you did, maybe others did. I thought many of you thought there was no possibility of my getting the plan I got passed, passed without any Republican votes. Pretty big deal. Got passed. Growing economy. People’s lives are changing. So let’s see what happens. All I know, I’ve been hired to solve problems, to solve problems, not create division. Okay. Thanks so much, Mr. President. You’ve said over and over again that immigrants shouldn’t come to this country right now. This isn’t the time to come. That message is not being received. Instead, the perception of you that got you elected as a moral decent man is the reason why a lot of immigrants are coming to this country and entrusting you with unaccompanied minors. Well, look, I guess I should be flattered people are coming because I’m the nice guy. That’s the reason why it’s happening, that I’m a decent man or however it’s phrased, that that’s why they’re coming, because they know Biden’s a good guy. Truth of the matter is, nothing has changed. As many people came, a 28% increase in children to the border in my administration, 31% in the last year, in 2019, before the pandemic in the Trump administration. It happens every single solitary year. There is a significant increase in the number of people coming to the border in the winter months of January, February, March. It happens every year. In addition to that, there is a …. And by the way, does anybody suggest that there was a 31% increase under Trump because he was a nice guy and he was doing good things at the border? That’s not the reason they’re coming. The reason they’re coming is that it’s the time they can travel with the least likelihood of dying on the way because of the heat and the desert, number one. Number two, they’re coming because of the circumstances in country, in country. The way to deal with this problem, and I started to deal with it back when I was Vice President putting together a bipartisan plan of over $700 million to do the root causes of why people are leaving. What did Trump do? He eliminated that funding. He didn’t use it. He didn’t do it. And in addition to that, what he did, he dismantled all the elements that exist to deal with what had been a problem and has been continued to be a problem for a long time. He, in fact, shut down the number of beds available. He did not fund HHS to get people to get the children out of those Border Patrol facilities, where they should not be, and not supposed to be more than a few days, a little while. But he dismantled all of that, and so what we’re doing now is attempting to rebuild the system that can accommodate what is happening today. And I’d like to think it’s because I’m a nice guy, but it’s not. It’s because of what’s happened every year. Let me say one other thing on this. If you take a look at the number of people are coming, the vast majority, the overwhelming majority of people coming to the border and crossing are being sent back, are being sent back. Thousands, tens of thousands of people who are over 18 years of age and single people, one at a time coming, have been sent back, sent home. We’re sending back the vast majority of the families that are coming. We’re trying to work out now with Mexico their willingness to take more of those families back. That’s what’s happening. They’re not getting across the border. And those who are coming across the border who are unaccompanied children, we’re moving rapidly to try to put in place what was dismantled, as I said. For example, of all the children who are coming across the border, over 70% are either 16 or 17 years old. We’re not talking about people ripping babies from mothers arms or a little three-year old standing on the border, less than I think it’s one and a half percent fall in the category of the very young. So what we’re doing is we’re providing for the space again to be able to get these kids out of the border patrol facilities, which no child, no one should be in any longer than 72 hours. And today I went to, for example, I used all the resources available to me went to the Defense Department and the Secretary of Defense has just made available Fort Bliss, 5,000 beds. Be immediately available, 5,000 beds on the Texas border. So we’re building back up the capacity that should have been maintained and built upon that Trump dismantled. It’s going to take time. And the other thing we’re doing, I might add, am I giving you too long an answer, because if you don’t want the detail. No, no, but I mean, I don’t know how much detail you want about immigration. Maybe I’ll stop there. My follow-up question is, one, if you could talk a little bit about which families, why they’re being allowed to stay, what the families that are being allowed to stay, why they’re being allowed to stay. In addition to that, when it comes to the filibuster, which is what Zeke was asking about, immigration is a big issue, of course, related to the filibuster, but there’s also Republicans who are passing bill after bill trying to restrict voting rights. Chuck Schumer’s calling it in an existential threat to democracy. Well, look, I’m going to deal with all of those problems. The question is, the priorities as they come and land on my plate. Let’s go to the first question you asked, the first of the second questions you’ve asked, and that is, what about dealing with families? Why are some not going back? Because Mexico is refusing to take them back. They’re saying they won’t take them back, not all of them. We’re in negotiations with the President of Mexico. I think we’re going to see that change. They should all be going back, all be going back. The only people we’re not going to let sitting there on the other side of the Rio Grande by themselves with no help are children. And what we’re doing there, and it’s important point to understand, I know you understand it, I don’t mean to say it that way, an important point to focus on, the vast majority of people under the age of 18 coming to the United States come with a telephone number on a wristband or come with a telephone number in their pocket in the United States. A mother, a father, a close relative, a grandma, or grandpa. What was happening before is it’s taking literally weeks and weeks and maybe even months before anybody’d pick up the phone and call to see if there really was someone there. Well, we’ve set up a system now where within 24 hours there’s a phone call made as that person, that child crosses the border. And then a verification system being put in place as of today to determine quickly whether or not that is a trafficker being called, or that is actually a mom, a dad and or a close relative. Establishing that right off the bat. If it in fact is mom or dad. Dad says, to take the extreme case, “I got a birth certificate.”J Then guess what? We’re getting that kid directly to that parent immediately. And so that’s going to reduce significantly. There’s two ways to reduce child populations in circumstances that are not acceptable, like being held at a border patrol station. One is to get them to the place where they have a relative and set a date as to when the hearing can be held. The second way to do it is put them in a health and human services facility that we’re occupying now, both licensed beds around the country that exists, as well as, for example, federal resources like Fort Bliss, to get them safely in a place where they can be taken care of while they’re fate is determined. [inaudible 00:17:02] filibuster. Filibuster. Filibuster. With regard to the filibuster, I believe we should go back to a position of the filibuster that existed just when I came to the United States Senate 120 years ago. And that is that it used to be required for the filibuster… And I had a card on this. I was going to give you the statistics, but you probably know them. That it used to be that from between 1917 and 1971, the filibuster existed, there were a total of 58 eight motions to break the filibuster, that whole time. Last year alone, there were five times that many. So it’s being abused in a gigantic way. And for example, it used to be, you had to stand there and talk and talk and talk and talk until you collapsed. And guess what? People got tired of talking and tired of collapsing. Filibusters broke down and were able to break the filibuster, get a [inaudible 00:18:05] vote. So I strongly support moving in that direction, in addition to having an open mind about dealing with certain things that are just elemental to the functioning of our democracy, like the right to vote, like the basic right to vote. We’ve amended the filibuster in the past. But here’s the deal. As you observed, I’m a fairly practical guy. I want to get things done. I want to get them done consistent with what we promised the American people. And in order to do that in a 50 50 Senate, we’ve got to get to the place where I get 50 votes so that the Vice President of the United States can break the tie, or I get 51 votes without her. And so I’m going to say something outrageous. I’ve never been particularly poor at calculating how to get things done in the United States Senate. So the best way to get something done, if you hold near and dear to you that you like to be able to… Anyway, we’re ready to get a lot done. And if we have to, if there’s complete lockdown and chaos as a consequence of the filibuster, then we’ll have to go beyond what I’m talking about. Okay. Hang on. Sorry. Oh, [inaudible 00:19:36], Ms. Kim. Ms. Thank you, Mr. President. If we can ed with 51, we would have no problem. You’re going to have to… The existing rule… It’s going to be hard to get a parliamentary ruling that allows 50 votes to end the filibuster, the existence of a filibuster. But it’s not my expertise on what the parliamentary rules on how to get there are. But our preoccupation with the filibuster is totally legitimate. But in the meantime, we got a lot we can do while we’re talking about what we’re going to do with about the filibuster. Let me get here. Okay. Cecilia Vega. I’d like to circle back to immigration, please. You just listed the reasons that people are coming, talking about in-country problems, saying that it happens every year. You blamed the last administration, sir. I just got back last night from a reporting trip to the border where I met nine-year-old Josevs who walked here from Honduras by himself along with another little boy. He had that phone number on him and we were able to call his family. His mother says that she sent her son to this country because she believes that you are not deporting unaccompanied minors like her son. That’s why she sent him alone from Honduras. Well, look, the idea that I’m going to say, which I would never do, if an unaccompanied child ends up at the border, we’re just going to let them starve to death and stay on the other side, no previous administrations did either, except Trump. I’m not going to do it. I’m not going to do it. That’s why I’ve asked the Vice President of United States yesterday to be the lead person on dealing with focusing on the fundamental reasons why people leave Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador in the first place. It’s because of earthquakes, floods. It’s because of lack of food. It’s because of gang violence. It’s because of a whole range of things, that when I was Vice President, had the same obligation to deal with unaccompanied children. I was able to get it slowed up significantly by working with the heads of state of those communities, to do things like, in one of the major cities, the reason people were leaving as they couldn’t walk to the street because their kids were getting beat up or shot or in gang violence. Well, what I was able to do is not give money to the head of state, because so many are corrupt, but I was able to say, “Okay, you need lighting in the streets to change things? I’ll put the lighting in.” We got a contractor. We got the type of lighting. We paid directly to the contractor, did not go through the government. And violent crime significantly was reduced in that city. Fewer people sought to leave. When this hurricane occurred, the two hurricanes, instead of us going down and helping in a major way so that people would not have a reason to want to leave in the first place because they didn’t have housing or water or sustenance, we did nothing. We’re going to do a lot in our administration. We’re going to be spending that 700 plus million dollars a year to change the life and circumstances of why people leave in the first place. That mother did not sit around on the kitchen table and say, “I got a great idea. He’s nine. I also met a ten year old. “A nine year old. I’m going to send him on a thousand mile journey across the desert and up to the United States, because I know Joe Biden’s a nice guy and he’ll take care of him.” What a desperate act to have to take. The circumstances must be horrible. So we can do something about that. That’s what the Vice President’s going to be doing, what I did when President Obama asked me to come and deal. I was in Turkey at the time. He said, “You got to come home and take care of this.” So we put together a plan and it had an impact. And so the question here is whether, how we go ahead and do this, what we do. There’s no easy answer. A quick follow, if I may. Well, the judgment has to be made whether or not, and in this young man’s case, he has a mom. There’s an overwhelming reason why he’d be put in a plane and flown back to his mom. Final follow, sir. You mentioned circumstances that must be horrific. The customs and border protection facility in Donna, Texas, I was there, is that 1,556% capacity right now with mostly unaccompanied minors. There are kids that are sleeping on floors. They are packed into these pods. I’ve spoken to lawyers who say that some of these children have not seen the sun in days. That’s a serious question, right? Is that acceptable to me? Come on. That’s why we’re going to be moving 1,000 of those kids out quickly. That’s why I got Fort Bliss opened up. That’s why I’ve been working from the moment this started to happen to try to find additional access for children to be able to safely, not just children, but particularly children, to be able to safely be housed while we follow through on the rest of what’s happening. That is totally unacceptable. Ken. Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to ask you about Afghanistan. You face a May 1st deadline for the withdrawal of us troops from that country. As a candidate in foreign affairs, you wrote that it is past time to end these forever wars. The answer is that it’s going to be hard to meet the May one deadline, just in terms of tactical reasons. It’s hard to get those troops out. So what we’ve been doing, what I’ve been doing, and what Secretary Blinken has been doing has been, we’ve been meeting with our allies, those other nations that have NATO allies who have troops in Afghanistan as well. And if we leave, we’re going to do so in a safe and orderly way. We’re in consultation, I say, with our allies and partners and how to proceed, and Secretary Blinken is meeting in Brussels this week with our NATO allies, particularly those who have forces there. And General Austin just met with Kayani and I’m waiting for the briefing on that. He is the leader, quote, in Afghanistan and Kabul. And there’s a UN led process that’s beginning shortly on how to mechanically get people… How to end this war. But it is not my intention to stay there for a long time. But the question is how, and in what circumstances do we meet that agreement that was made by President Trump to leave under a deal that looks like it’s not being able to be worked out to begin with? How’s that done? But we are not staying a long time. You just said, “If we leave. We will leave. The question is when we leave. Sorry. I can’t picture that being the case. Okay. Kristen. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I will commit when my plan very shortly is underway to let you have access to not just them, but to other facilities as well. How soon will journalists be able to have access to the facilities? We’ve obviously been allowed to be inside one, but we haven’t seen the facilities in which children are packed together to really give the American people a chance to see that. I will commit to transparency, as soon as I am in a position to be able to implement what we’re doing right now. One of the reasons I haven’t gone down, my chief folks have gone down, is I don’t want it to become the issue. I don’t want to be bringing all the Secret Service and everybody with me to get in the way. So this has being set up and you’ll have full access to everything once we get this thing moving. Okay. And just to be clear, how soon will that be Mr. I don’t know, to be clear. [inaudible 00:30:07] responsibility for everything that’s happening at the border now. I hear you talking a lot about the past administration. You decided to roll back some of those policies. First of all, all the policies that were underway were not helping at all, did not slow up the amount of immigration, and as many people coming. And rolling back the policies of separating children from their mothers? I make no apology for that. Rolling back the policies have remaining in Mexico, sitting on the edge of the Rio Grande in a muddy circumstance with not enough to eat? I make no apologies for that. I make no apologies for ending programs that did not exist before Trump became president that have an incredibly negative impact on the law, international law, as well as on human dignity. And so I make no apologies for that. [inaudible 00:31:12] ask you about foreign policy, Mr. President. Overnight, we learned that North Korea tested two ballistic missiles. Let me say that number one, UN Resolution 1718 was violated by those particular missiles that were tested, number one. We’re consoling with our allies and partners. And there will be responses if they choose to escalate. We will respond accordingly. Form of diplomacy, but it has to be conditioned upon the end result of denuclearization. So that’s what we’re doing right now, consulting with our allies. Diplomacy, can you define what you mean? And former President Obama warned the incoming President trump that North Korea was the top foreign policy issue that he was watching. Yes. Okay. Hang on a second here. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I want to go back to voting rights. And as Yamiche mentioned, Republican legislatures across the country are working to pass bills that would restrict voting, particularly, Democrats fear, impacting minority voters and young voters, the very people who helped to get you elected in November. What I’m worried about is how un-American this whole initiative is. It’s sick. It’s sick. Deciding in some states that you cannot bring water to people standing in line waiting to vote, deciding that you’re going to end voting at five o’clock when working people are just getting off work, deciding that there will be no absentee ballots under the most rigid circumstances, it’s all designed, and I’m going to spend my time doing three things. One, trying to figure out how to pass the legislation passed by the House, number one, number two, educating the American public. The Republican voters I know find this despicable, Republican voters, the folks outside this White House. I’m not talking about the elected officials. I’m talking about voters. Voters. And so I’m convinced that we’ll be able to stop this because it is the most pernicious thing. This makes Jim Crow look like Jim Eagle. I mean, this is gigantic what they’re trying to do and it cannot be sustained. I’m going to do everything in my power, along with my friends in the House and the Senate, to keep that from becoming the law. The answer is yes, but I’m not going to lay out a strategy in front of the whole world and you now. Then, on a related note, have you decided whether you are going to run for reelection in 2024? You haven’t set up a reelection campaign yet as your predecessor had by this time. My predecessor needed to. My predecessor, oh God, I miss him. No, the answer is yes, my plan is to run for reelection. That’s my expectation. And on one other note, on bipartisanship, your old friend, Mitch McConnell, says you have only spoken to each other once since you took office and that you have moved far left since taking office. No, I haven’t at all. I’ve been meeting… When’s the last time a president invited the opposite party down at least a half a dozen times to talk about issues, everything from how we work? We’re working with a group of 20 members of the Senate right now and House on how we reestablish our ability to make computer chips and how we get ahead of the game, how we can work together. And we’re working together on a bunch of things. But look, I know Mitch well, Mitch knows me well. I would expect Ms to say exactly what he said, but this is a matter of making sure that I would like Republican, elected Republican support, but what I know I have now is I have electoral support from Republican voters. Republican voters agree with what I’m doing. And so unless Mitch says the last thing I did, this last piece of legislation is so far left, well, then you ought to take a look at his party. Over 50% of them must be over that edge as well because they support what I did. Okay. Where am I here? Let me see. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I have a question for you, but first I’d like to follow up on a question from Yamiche, and that’s on the filibuster. That counts as a question, but go ahead. Okay. I’ll make it quick. It’s a good question. No, no you can. Regarding the filibuster, at John Lewis’ funeral, President Barack Obama said he believed the filibuster was a relic of the Jim Crow era. Yes. Successful electoral politics is the art of the possible. Let’s figure out how we can get this done and move in the direction of significantly changing the abuse of even the filibuster rule first. It’s been abused from the time it came into being by an extreme way in the last 20 years. Let’s deal with the abuse first. It sounds like you’re moving to eliminating the filibuster. I answered your question. You also just made some news by saying that you are going to run for reelection. I said that is my expectation. Look, I don’t know where you guys come from, man. I’ve never been able to travel. I’m a great respecter of fate. I’ve never been able to plan four and a half, three and a half years ahead for certain. I would fully expect that to be the case. She’s doing a great job. She’s a great partner. She’s a great partner. Oh, come on. I don’t even think about it. I have no idea. I have no idea whether there’ll be Republican party. I mean, look, the way I view things, I’ve become a great respecter fate in my life. I set a goal that’s in front of me to get things done for the people I care most about, which are hard-working decent American people really having it stuck to them. I want to change the paradigm. I want to change the paradigm where we start to reward work, not just wealth. I want to change the paradigm. If you notice, didn’t you find it kind of interesting that my Republican friends were worried about the cost and the taxes that had to be had, if there is any tax to be had as they talk about it, in dealing with the act that we just passed which puts money in people’s pockets, ordinary people, to hear them complain when they passed a close to $2 trillion Trump tax cut, 83% going to the top 1%. I love the fact that they found this whole idea of concern about the federal budget, it’s kind of amazing. When the federal budget is saving people’s lives, they don’t think it’s such a good idea. When the federal budget is feathering the nest of the wealthiest Americans, 90 of the Fortune 500 companies making billions of dollars, not paying a cent in taxes, reducing taxes to the point that people who are making, you know, if you’re a husband and wife, a school teacher and a cop, you’re paying at a higher rate than the average person making a billion dollars a year is. Something’s wrong. There are new found concern. I’m concerned. Look, I meant what I said when I ran, and a lot of you still think I’m wrong and I respect that. I said I’m running for three reasons, to restore the soul, dignity, honor, honesty, transparency to the American political system, two, to rebuild the backbone of this country. The middle-class, hard-working people and people struggling to get in to the middle class, they built America and unions built them. The third reason I said I was running was to unite the country. And generically speaking, all of you said no, you can’t do that. Well, I’ve not been able to unite the Congress, but I’ve been united in the country, based on the polling data. We have to come together. We have to. So from my perspective, to me, it’s about just getting out there, putting one foot in front of the other and just trying to make things better for people, just hard-working people, people who get up every morning and just want to figure out how to put food on the table for their kids, to be able to have a little bit of breathing room, being able to make sure that they go to bed not staring to see like my dad did wondering whether, since he didn’t have health insurance, what happens if mom gets sick or he got sick. These are basic things, basic things. And I’m of the view that the vast majority of people, including registered Republicans by and large share that same view, that same sense of what’s appropriate. Justin, Justin [inaudible 00:42:24], Bloomberg. Thanks, Mr. President, I wanted to ask about your relationship with China now that you’ve been in office for a couple of months. There’s obviously the meeting in Alaska that was a little theatrical and there’s the continued human rights [inaudible 00:42:39]. Well, look, they’re each specifically legitimate questions, but they only touch a smidgen of what the relationship with China really is about. I’ve known Xi Jinping for a long time. Allegedly by the time I left office as Vice President, I had spent more time with Xi Jinping than any world leader had because President Obama and the Chinese President Hu decided we should get to know one another since it was inappropriate for the president of United States to spend time with the vice president of another country, but it was obvious he was going to become the new leader of China. So I spent hours upon hours with him alone with an interpreter, my interpreter and his, going into great detail. [inaudible 00:43:56] very, very straightforward. He doesn’t have a democratic with a small D bone in his body, but he’s a smart, smart guy. He’s one of the guys like Putin who thinks that autocracy is the wave of the future and democracy can’t function in an ever complex world. So when I was elected and he called to congratulate me, I think to the surprise of the China experts who were his people on the call as well as mine listening, we had a two hour conversation for two hours, and we made several things clear to one another. I made it clear to him again what I’ve told them in person on several occasions, that we’re not looking for confrontation, although we know there will be steep, steep competition. Two, that we’ll have strong competition, but we’ll insist the China play by the international rules, fair competition, fair practices, fair trade. Thirdly, in order to compete effectively, I indicated that we’re going to deal with China effectively, and we’re going to need three things to do that [inaudible 00:45:20] our people. First, we’re going to invest in American workers and American science. I said that all through the campaign, I say it again, and I’m setting up my administration to be able to do that, which is that back in the ’60s, we used to invest a little over 2% of our entire GDP in pure research and investment in science. Today it’s 0.7%. I’m going to change that. We’re going to change that. The future lies in who can in fact own the future as it relates to technology, quantum computing, a whole range of things, including the medical fields. And so what I’m going to do is make sure we invest closer to 2%. One of the reasons why I’ve set up the [inaudible 00:46:12], the president’s board was scientists and the like, again, is we’re going to invest in medical research, cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, industries of the future, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, biotech, and we’re going to make real investments. China is out-investing us by a long shot because their plan is to own that future. The second thing we’re going to do is we’re going to reestablish our alliances. And I’ve been very clear with him. It’s not anti-Chinese. And we’ve talked about it. I want to make sure that, for example, later today, after this, and a matter of fact, shortly after this, which is fine, we’ve been going close to an hour, I’m happy to go longer, but one of the things that I’m going to be doing, I’m going to be speaking with 27 heads of state in Europe, and very shortly, I think within the next hour or so, I don’t know the exact time. And earlier this month, and apparently it got the Chinese attention, that’s not why I did it, I met with our allies and how are we going to hold China accountable in the region, Australia, India, Japan, and the United States, the so-called quad, because we have to have democracies working together. Before too long, I’m going to have, I’m going to invite an alliance of democracies to come here to discuss the future. The South China Sea, or the North China Sea, or their agreement made on Taiwan or a whole range of other things. And the third thing, and the thing that I admire about dealing with Xi is he understands, he makes no pretense about not understanding what I’m saying anymore I knew him. I pointed out to him, “No leader can be sustained in his position or her position unless they represent the values of the country.” And I said, ” Mr. President, as I’ve told you before, Americans value the notion of freedom, America values human rights. We don’t always live up to our expectations, but there’s a value system. We are founded on that principle. And as long as you and your country continues to so blatantly violate human rights, we are going to continue in an unrelenting way to call it to the attention of the world and make it clear, make it clear what’s happening. And he understood that. I made it clear that no American president, at least one did, but no American president had ever backed down from speaking out of what’s happening in the Uyghurs, what’s happening in Hong Kong. What’s happening in-country. That’s who we are. The moment a president walks away from that as the last one did, is the moment we began to lose all legitimacy around the world. It’s who we are. So I see stiff competition with China. China has an overall goal, and I don’t criticize them for the goal, but they have an overall goal to become the leading country in the world, the wealthiest country in the world and the most powerful country in the world. That’s not going to happen on my watch because United States is going to continue to grow and expand. No, that’s not going to make the decision. That’s where I make sure we’re all on the same page. All on the same page. Look, I predict to you, your children or grandchildren are going to be doing their doctoral thesis on the issue of who succeeded autocracy or democracy, because that is what is at stake, not just with China, look around the world. We’re in the midst of a fourth industrial revolution of enormous consequence. Will there be middle class? How will people adjust to these significant changes in science and technology? The environment? How will they do that? And our democracy is equipped because all the people get to speak, to compete. It is clear, absolutely clear. And most of the scholars I dealt with at Penn agree with me around the country, that this is a battle between the utility of democracies in the 21st century and autocracies. If you notice, you don’t have Russia talking about communism anymore, it’s about an autocracy. Demand decisions made by a leader of a country. That’s what’s at stake here. We’ve got to prove democracy works. Mr. President, sorry. I know you haven’t had a chance to address the tragedies in Georgia and Colorado. You had said to stay tuned for actions that you might take on gun control. Wondering if you’ve made a decision either about sending the Manufacturer Liability Bill that you had promised on day one to Capitol Hill or executive actions like going after ghost guns or giving money to cities and states to battle gun control. All the above. It’s a matter of timing. As you’ve all observed, successful presidents, better than me, have been successful in large part because they know how to time what they’re doing. Order it, decide and priorities, what needs to be done. The next major initiative is, and I’ll be announcing it Friday in Pittsburgh in detail, is to rebuild the infrastructure, both physical and technological infrastructure of this country so that we can compete and create significant numbers of really good paying jobs. Really good paying jobs. And some of you have been around long enough to know that used to be a great Republican goal initiative. I still think the majority of the American people don’t like the fact that we are now ranked what, 85th in the world in infrastructure. I mean, look, the future rests on whether or not we have the best airports that are going to accommodate air travel. Ports that you can get in and out of quickly. So businesses decide. Some of you if you were ever local reporters and you find your governor or mayor trying to attract business to your community. What’s the first thing that business asked? What’s the closest access to an interstate highway? How far am I from a freight rail? Is there water? Is there water available? Is there enough water available for me to conduct my business? All the things that relate to infrastructure. We have somewhere, I asked the staff to write it down for me and they did. Not for this, but for a longer discussion. We have somewhere in terms of infrastructure, we rank 13th globally in infrastructure. China is investing three times more in infrastructure than the United States is. Bridges more than one-third of our bridges, 231,000 of them need repairs. Some are physical safety risks, or preservation work. One in five miles of our highways and major roads are in poor condition. That’s 186,000 miles of highway. Aviation, 20% of all flights, 20% of all flights weren’t on time resulting in 1.5 million hours lost in production. Six to 10 million homes in America still have lead pipes servicing their water lines. We have over a hundred thousand wellheads that are not kept, leaking methane. What are we doing? And by the way, we can put as many pipe fitters and miners on us to work, capping those wells at the same price that they were charged to dig those wells. So I just find it frustrating, frustrating and talk about. Last year point I’ll make in the infrastructure and I apologize for spending more time on it, but is that if you think about it, it’s the place where we will be able to see significantly increase American productivity. At the same time, providing really good jobs for people. But we can’t build back to what they used to be. We have to build the environments are… Global warming has already done significant damage. The roads that used to be above the water level, didn’t have to worry about where the drainage dish was. Now you got to rebuild them three feet higher because it’s not going to go back to what it was before, only get worse unless we stop it. There’s so much we can do. Look at all the schools in America. Most of you live in the Washington area now, but in your hometowns, I don’t know where you’re all from. How many schools where the kids can’t drink the water out of the fountain? How many schools are still in a position where there’s asbestos? How many schools in America we’re sending our kids to don’t have adequate ventilation? How many schools, buildings, office complexes are wasting billions of barrels of oil over time because they can’t hold in the heat or the air conditioning because there’s leaks through the windows that are so porous and the connections. It’s amazing. So there’s so much we can do that’s good stuff. Makes people healthier and creates good jobs. And I think that I got one more question here. And Janet from Univision. Thank you, Mr. President. We do have to be reporting at the border. And just like to Celia, we run into a pair of siblings who came in on Monday, were detained by CBP, had the phone number for their mother who lives in the U.S. We have contacted the mother. That’s the only way they know her kids are here because CBP today, Thursday has not contacted that mother. Well, they’re already getting better, but they’re going to get real, I got a whole hell of a lot better real quicker. We’re going to hear some people leaving. Okay. We can get this done. We’re going to get it done. I had a long meeting with the entire team and several cabinet level officers the other night. We’re going to be moving within the next week, over a hundred thousand, I mean a thousand people out of the border patrol into safe, secure beds and facilities. We’re going to significantly ramp up, we’re already out there contacting everyone from getting some of the employees at HHS. And there’s a lot of them doing other things and move them into making those calls. We’re in the process of rearranging and providing for the personnel needed to get that done. But I admire the fact that you were down there. You’re making the calls yourself. It’s real. The next thing that has to happen though, as you well know, has to happen, there have to be some certitude that this is the actually mom, dad, or whomever. And there’s ways to do that. There’s ways to do that a little bit like determining whether or not you got the right code for your credit card. What was your dog’s name kind of thing. I’m being a bit facetious, but not really. And also seeking harder data from DNA to birth certificates, which takes longer. So I want to do this as quickly, as humanly possible and as safely as possible. As we all know, treating the root causes in Latin America doesn’t change things overnight. How do you realistically and physically keep these families from coming to the U. Well, I can’t guarantee that but I know that all thing, the journey of a thousand miles starts with the first step. You know as well as I do, you cover it. You have serious… It’s not like somebody sitting on a Hanuman table in Guatemala, I mean somewhere in Mexico or in Guadalupe said, “I got a great idea. Let’s sell everything we have, give it to a coyote. Have them take our kids across the border into a desert where they don’t speak the language. Won’t that be fun? Let’s go.” That’s not how it happens. People don’t want to leave. When my great grandfather got in a coffin ship in the Irish Sea expectation was was he going to live long enough on that ship to get to the United States of America. But they left because of what the Brits had been doing. They were in real, real trouble. They didn’t want to leave, but they had no choice. So we can’t, I can’t guarantee we’re going to solve everything, but I can guarantee we can make everything better. We can make it better. We can change the lives of so many people. And the other thing I want to point out to you, and I hope you point out, I realize it’s much more heart-wrenching and it is to deal with a five and six and seven year old, but you went down there and you saw the vast majority of these children. 70% are 16 years old, 17 years old and mostly males. That make it good or bad or different. But the idea that we have tens of thousands of kids in these God off of facilities that are really little babies crying all night, there’s some, that’s true. That’s why we got to act. And yesterday I asked my team both the director of the two agencies, as well as others. I asked them what would they in fact, and I asked their opinion because they’re the experts. But I said, “Focus on the most vulnerable immediately.” But there’s no reason why in the next month, as people crossed the border, that phone call can’t be made in the first 48 hours and began. No, because I know they have to posture for a while. They sort of got to get out of their system. This is a… But I’m ready to work with any Republican who wants to help solve the problem or make the situation better. But folks, I’m going. Thank you very, very much. I appreciate it, thank you."
"52","03-29-21"," Good afternoon. Last week we set a goal of 200 million shots by day 100 of the administration, double the original goal that I had said. And to make that progress, over the last three days, we’ve had a record number of shots in arms with over 10 million shots recorded in the weekend. Over 10 million shots in three days, that would have been inconceivable in January. The progress we’ve made on vaccinating this country is a great American story. The federal government has stepped up, taken responsibility and launched a massive federal vaccination program. Governors and mayors of both political parties, Republicans and Democrats have stepped up as well. Our military, our National Guard, FEMA, they have all been incredible, healthcare providers, community leaders from all walks of life. So many volunteers of all ages and backgrounds stepped up as well. My fellow Americans, look at what we have done in the past 10 weeks. No other country has come close, 100 million shots in less than 60 days. And now we’re moving to the next 100 million shots in just 40 days. You heard me say many times before, our progress in vaccination is a stunning example that there’s nothing, nothing this country cannot do if we put our minds to it and we do it together. But as I’ve also said, I will always give you it straight, straight from the shoulder, our work is far from over. The war against COVID-19 is far from won. This is deadly serious. We share the sentiment of Dr. Walensky, the head of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC expressed earlier today this is not a time to lessen our efforts. That’s what she said. We could still see a setback in the vaccination program. And most importantly, if we let our guard down now, we could see the virus getting worse, not better. As many people as we’ve vaccinated, we still have more Americans left to go. We will administer more shots in March than any country on earth. But even so, we have to give more shots in April than we did in March because we’re in the life and death race for the virus that is spreading quickly with cases rising again, new variants are spreading and sadly, some of the reckless behavior we’ve seen on television over the past few weeks means that more new cases are to come in the weeks ahead. With vaccines there’s hope, which is a very good thing to state the obvious, but people are letting up on precautions, which is a very bad thing. Look, to this point, cases have fallen two thirds since I took office, deaths have also fallen two thirds, but now cases are going back up, and in some states, deaths are as well. We’re giving up hard fought, hard won gains. And as much as we’re doing, America, it’s time to do even more. All of us have to do our part, every one of us. So let me start here, first, this week, thanks to my administration’s intensive work with vaccine manufacturers and distribution efforts, the amount of vaccines that are going to be available for vaccination sites will be a new record, 33 million doses of vaccine this week. By getting more vaccine supplied to states, community health centers, and pharmacies, we can vaccinate the highest risk Americans even more quickly than we already are. And then, and then we make it possible to open up the supplies for all adults and try to beat the renewed spread of this virus. As a result, I’m also pleased to announce that we’re on track this week, just 10 weeks after I became president to achieve nearly 75% of Americans over the age of 65 get at least one vaccination shot. When I took office in January 20th, that number was 8%, it’s going to 75%. That’s a lot of grandparents are now able to safely hug their grandchildren and they couldn’t do so just a short time ago. And with the supply we’re releasing this week, just this week alone, there are more doses of vaccine available for seniors this week than any week thus far. So seniors, please, if you have not gotten your shot yet, get it this week, get it. Second, I’m reiterating my call for every governor, mayor, and local leader to maintain and reinstate the mass mandate. Please, this is not politics, reinstate the mandate if you let it down. And business should require masks as well. The failure to take this virus seriously, precisely what got in this mess in the first place, risks more cases and more deaths. Look, as I do my part to accelerate the distribution of vaccinations, I need the American people to do their part as well. Mask up, mask up, it’s a patriotic duty. It’s the only way we ever get back to normal, to cheer together in stadiums full of fans, to gather together on holidays again safely, go to graduations, weddings. Third, I announced on March 11th, I direct every state, territory, and tribe to open up their vaccinations to all adults no later than May 1. I issued that order because moving beyond priority groups to enable all adults to get vaccinated is critical to having a July 4th that’s closer to normal. I want this to come as quickly as possible. And I want to thank the governors, Democrats and Republicans who have responded to this directive. In fact, the vast majority of governors have set open access dates even earlier than a deadline of May 1st. But in this race against the rapidly spreading virus, as fast as we are going, we need to go faster. So to make it easier for Americans to get vaccinated as the supply grows and vaccination eligibility expands, I’m directing my COVID team to ensure there is a vaccine site within five miles of 90% of all Americans by April the 19th, three weeks from today. Look, we’re going to do this by growing from having 17,000 pharmacies giving out vaccination shots to nearly 40,000 pharmacies doing it within the next three weeks. That’ll more than double the number of pharmacies where you can go get vaccinated. We aren’t stopping there. In the next three weeks, we’ll add 12 more federally run mass vaccination sites. Every day at these sites, tens of thousands of people are able to drive up, get a vaccine shot while in their car and leave in less than an hour. And over 60% of the shots given at these sites goes to minority communities because in minority communities, we have to reach out, they’re the ones most affected by both the vaccine, but also by the pandemic. We’re also going to send more aid to states to expand the opening of more community vaccination sites, more vaccines, more sites, more vaccinators, all designed to speed our critical work. We also need to make it easier for those who want shots but cannot access vaccination sites to get vaccinated. This is also where we’re focused on the seniors most immediately. While we have made incredible progress and starting to vaccinate nearly three quarters of our seniors and now putting vaccination sites within five miles of 90% of all Americans, that still isn’t enough as far as we’re concerned. We know that there are a number of seniors and people with disabilities who may be isolated and have lack of access to transportation. And there are community groups that can help, they’re trying to help now. So our fourth announcement today is that I’m sending out millions of dollars through the Department of Health and Human Services to provide assistance, including transportation so more vulnerable seniors and people with disabilities can get their shots, because they get help to physically get there to get the shot. Neighbors helping neighbors, what a truly American effort. We cannot let transportation be a barrier to any senior getting a vaccination. And so where does this put us? We’re making progress on vaccinations, but cases are rising and the virus is spreading in too many places still. That’s why today I’m taking these steps to make our American turnaround story, our vaccination program move even faster. Thanks to all the work we’ve done these past 10 weeks, the added steps I’m announcing today with them, I’m pleased to announce that at least 90% of all adults in this country will be eligibly vaccinated by April the 19th, just three weeks from now as we have the vaccines. For the vast, vast majority of adults, you won’t have to wait until May 1, you’ll be eligible for your shot on April 19th. Finally, 10% will be eligible no later than… the final 10%, are eligible no later than May 1. And as I just said, due to the steps we’re taking today, 90% of Americans will be within five miles of the location where they can get a shot as of April the 19th. So we’re moving toward 90/90 by April 19th. That is by April 19th, three weeks from today, 90% of adults, people 18 and over will be eligible to get vaccinated. 90% of all Americans will be living within five miles of a place they can get a shot. And of course, it’ll take time for everyone to get their appointment. It’s a big country. And as fast as we’re going, we still have a long way to go to finish this vaccination effort. In fact, we aren’t even there, we’re even halfway yet, but being at 90/90 just three weeks from today should give hope to the country. Let me close with this. The progress we’re making is a significant testament to what we can do when we work together as Americans. But as I’ve always said, we still need everyone to do their part. We still are in a war with this deadly virus. And we’re bolstering our defenses, but this war is far from won. Together we have so much to be proud of the past three weeks, past more than three weeks, past 10 weeks. We also have so much to be sorrowful about, nearly 1,000 Americans a day are still dying from COVID-19 as we approach 550,000 deaths in a single year. Until this country is vaccinated, each of us has to do our part. We have an obligation, patriotic obligation. Wash your hands, stay socially distance. Wear a mask as recommended by the CDC and get vaccinated. Get your friends and family vaccinated when you can help. Now’s not the time to let down. Now’s not the time to celebrate. It is time to do what we do best as a country. Our duty, our jobs, take care of one another and fight this to the finish. We can and we’ll do this, but don’t let up now. Don’t let up now. Thank you, and may God protect our troops. Thank you very much. Mr. President, Dr. I just explained it, I think thoroughly. I hope I did anyway. Thank you. Mr. Yes."
"53","03-31-21"," Thank you. Gov. Mike asked me and I say to Bobby, my good friend, he asked me back there, he said, “Do you ever get nervous?” he said, “because I got up this morning and made breakfast for my kids and I got an introduced to the President.” And what I say to you, Mike, you did a heck of a job. But I’d get it nervous if I had to get up in the middle of the night climb up a telephone pole, replace in the middle of a storm, a connection that knocked out everybody’s electricity, put a transformer in. That’s what made would make me nervous. So what you did was really good. I couldn’t do what you do, pal. I couldn’t do what you do. And it’s true, Mike, you’re a union guy. Me too. I got in trouble, but I don’t make any apologies for it. I’m a union guy. I support unions. Unions built the middle class. It’s about time they start to get a piece of the action. To all my colleagues, from the County Executive to the Mayor, to everyone who’s here, I want to say, thank you. Thank you, Congressman for the passport into your district and I appreciate being here. I’m honored to be with you. Two years ago, I began my campaign here in Pittsburgh. I said I was running to rebuild the backbone of America. And today I return as your President to lay out the vision of how I believe we do that, rebuild the backbone of America. It’s a vision not seen through the eyes of Wall Street or Washington, but through the eyes of hard working people like the people I grew up with, people like Mike and his union family, union workers, from the carpenter’s training center, people like the folks I grew up with in Scranton and Claymont, Delaware, people would get up every day, work hard, raise their family, pay their taxes, serve their country, and volunteer for their communities. And just looking for a little bit of breathing room, just a little bit of light, ordinary Americans, doing extraordinary things, people would break their necks every day for their families and the country they love, a country that in fact which on the day I was elected was in extreme distress with the virus on a deadly rampage that has now killed over 4,500, excuse me, I carry it in my pocket every day, I have the list of exactly how many have died, 547,296 Americans dead from the virus, more than all the people killed in World War One, World War Two, the Vietnam War, 9/11. 547,296 Americans and an economy that left millions out of work and created so much anxiety. That’s why I moved so quickly to pass the American Rescue Plan with the help of my friends here in the Congress. I really mean that. It didn’t pass by a whole lot but with leadership of Connor and Bobby. You got it done, because it was an emergency. We needed to act to save jobs, to save businesses, to save lives, and that’s what we did. We’re beginning to see the results. We’re on our way to having given 200 million vaccination shots in the first 100 days of my presidency. When I said I’d get 100 million done, people thought it was a significant exaggeration. We’re going to get 200 million done, twice the original goal, because of all the help of all of you. Leading economists are now predicting our economy will grow 6% this year. That’s a rate we haven’t seen in years and years. We can cut child poverty in half this year with the American Rescue Plan we’re meeting immediate emergency. Now it’s time to rebuild. Even before the crisis we’re now facing, those at the very top in America were doing very well, which is fine. They’re doing great, but everyone else was falling behind. The pandemic only made the divisions so much worse and more obvious. Millions of Americans lost their jobs last year, while the wealthiest 1% of Americans saw their net worth increase by $4 trillion. Just goes to show you how distorted and unfair our economy has become. It wasn’t always this way. Well, it’s time to change that. I know parenthetically that I got criticized for giving tax breaks to middle class and poor folks this last time. I didn’t hear that cry when we’re doing the same thing. When Trump’s tax bill passed, 83% of the money went to the top 1%. No, this is not to target those who made it, not to seek retribution, this is about opening opportunities for everybody else. We all will do better when we all do well. It’s time to build our economy from the bottom up and from the middle out. Not the top down, it hadn’t worked very well. For the economy overall it hadn’t worked, because Wall Street didn’t build this country. You, the great middle class, built this country. And unions built the middle class. And it’s time. And this time, when we rebuild the middle class, we’re going to bring everybody along. Regardless your background, your color, your religion, [inaudible 00:09:43] Everybody gets to come along. So today I’m proposing a plan for the nation that rewards work, not just rewards wealth. It builds a fair economy that gives everybody a chance to succeed. And it’s going to create the strongest, most resilient, innovative economy in the world. It’s not a plan that tinkers around the edges, it’s a once in a generation investment in America, unlike anything we’ve seen or done since we built the interstate highway system and the space race decades ago. In fact, it’s largest American jobs investment since World War II. It’ll create millions of jobs, good paying jobs. It’ll grow the economy, make us more competitive around the world, promote our national security interest and put us in a position to win the global competition with China in the upcoming years. It’s big, yes. It’s bold, yes. And we can get it done. It has two parts. The American Jobs Plan and the American Families Plan, both are essential to our economic future. In a few weeks, I’ll talk about the American’s Family Plan. But today I want to talk about the Americans Jobs Plan. I’ll begin with the heart of the plan. It modernizes transportation infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our airports. I just left your airport. The director of the airport said, “We’re about to re renovate the airport.” Is that right, Mr. County Executive? “We’re going to innovate, we’re going to employ thousands of people.” And she looked at me and said, “I can’t thank you enough for this plan. It grows economy in key ways. It puts people to work to repair and upgrades that we badly need. It makes it easier and more efficient to move goods, to get to work and to make us more competitive around the world. Some of you local officials know, when someone wants come into the area and a company wants to invest what do they ask? “Where’s the first rail bed, how can I get to the railroad? What access to the interstate do I have? What’s the water like? Tell me about…” It goes on and on. It’s about infrastructure. The American Jobs Plan, we’re modernizing 20,000 miles of highways, roads, and main streets that are in difficult, difficult shape right now. It’ll fix the nation’s ten most economically significant bridges in America that require replacement. Remember that bridge that went down? We got ten, most economically significant bridges with more commerce going across it, that need to be replaced. We’ll also repair 10,000 bridges, desperately needed upgrades to unclog traffic, keep people safe and connect our cities, towns, and tribes across the country. The American Jobs Plan will build new rail corridors and transit lines, easing congestion, cutting pollution, slashing commute time, and opening up investment in communities that be connected to the cities and cities to the outskirts where a lot of jobs are these days. It’ll reduce the bottlenecks of commerce at our ports and our airports. The American Jobs Plan will lead to a transformational progress in our effort to tackle climate change with American jobs and American ingenuity. Protect our community from billions of dollars of damage from historic super-storms, floods, wildfires, droughts year after year, by making our infrastructure more secure and resilient. And ceasing incredible opportunities for American workers and American farmers in a clean energy future. Skilled workers, like one we just heard from, building a nationwide network of 500,000 charging stations. Creating good paying jobs by leading in the world in the manufacturing and export of clean electric cars and trucks. We’re going to provide tax incentives and point-of-sale rebates to help all American families afford clean vehicles of the future. The federal government owns an enormous fleet of vehicles which are going to be transitioned to clean electric vehicles and hydrogen vehicles right here in the United States of America, by American workers, with American products. When we make all of these investments we’re going to make sure, as the Executive Order I signed early on, that we buy American. That means investing in an American based companies and American workers. Not a contract will go out that I control that will not go to a company that is an American company with American products all the way down the line, and American workers. And we’ll buy the goods we need from all of America. Communities that have historically been left out of these investments, Black, Latino, Asian American, Native Americans, rural, small businesses, entrepreneurs across the country. Look, today up to 10 million homes in America and more than 400,000 schools and childcare centers have pipes, where they get their water from, pipes that are lead based pipes. Including pipes for drinking water. According to scientists, there is simply no safe exposure to lead for a child. That can slow development [inaudible 00:16:02] and hearing problems. The American Jobs Plan will put plumbers and pipe fitters to work replacing 100% of the nation’s lead pipes and service lines. So every American, every child, can turn on a faucet of a fountain and drink clean water. With each $5,000 investment, replacing a line, that can mean up to $22,000 in healthcare costs saved. A chance to protect our children, help them learn and thrive. We can’t delay. We can’t delay another minute. It’s long past due. You know in America where the early interest was in internet, this thing called the internet, that we invest in, we invented the early, early internet. It was invented here. Millions of Americans, though, lack access to reliable high-speed internet, including more than 35% of rural America. It’s a disparity even more pronounced during this pandemic. American jobs will make sure every single, every single American has access to high quality, affordable, high speed internet for businesses, for schools. And when I say affordable, I mean it. American’s pay too much for internet service. We’re going to drive down the price for families who have service now and make it easier for families who don’t have affordable service to be able to get it now. As we saw in Texas and elsewhere, our electrical power and power grids are vulnerable to storms, catastrophic failures and security lapses, with tragic results. My American Jobs Plan will put hundreds of thousands of people to work, hundreds of thousands of people to work. Line workers, electricians, and laborers laying thousands of miles of transmission line, building a modern, resilient, and fully clean grid, and capping hundreds of thousands of literally orphan oil and gas wells that need to be cleaned up because they’re abandoned, paying the same exact rate that a union man or woman would get having dug that well in the first place. We’ll build, upgrade, and weatherize affordable, energy-efficient housing and commercial buildings for millions of Americans. Even before the pandemic, millions of working families faced enormous financial and personal strain trying to raise their kids and care for their parents at the same time, the so-called sandwich generation, or family members of disability. You’ve got a child at home, you can’t stay home from work to take care of that child unless you’re going to put the child at risk or you lose your job, or you have an elderly parent you’re taking care. Seniors and people with disabilities living independently feel that strain as well, but we know if they can remain independently living, they live longer. The American Jobs Plan is going to help in big ways. It’s going to extend access to quality, affordable home and community-based care. Think of expanded vital services, like programs for seniors, or think of home care workers going into homes of seniors and people with disabilities, cooking meals, helping them get around their homes, and helping them be able to live more independently. For too long, caregivers who were disproportionately women and women of color and immigrants- This plan, along with the American Families Plan, changes that, with better wages, benefits and opportunities for millions of people who will be able to get to work in an economy that works for them. Now, decades ago, the United States government used to spend 2% of its GDP, its gross domestic product, on research and development. Today, we spend less than 1%. I think it’s 7/ 10ths of 1%. Here’s why that matters. We’re only a few major economies in the world who public investment in research and development as a share of GDP has declined constantly for the last 25 years, and we fall back. The rest of the world is closing in and closing in fast. We can’t allow this to continue. The American Jobs Plan is the biggest increase in our federal non-defense research and development spending on record. It’s going to boost America’s innovative edge in markets where global leadership is up for grabs, markets like battery technology, biotechnology, computer chips, clean energy, the competition with China in particular. Critics say we shouldn’t spend this money. They ask, what do we get out of it? Well, they said the same thing when first flew into space for the first time. They said the same thing. Well, pushing the frontiers led the big benefits back home. When NASA created Apollo’s digital flight control system, unheard of at the time, it led to technologies that help us today to drive our cars and fly our planes. When NASA invented ways to keep food safe for the astronauts, it led to programs that have been used for decades to keep food safe in supermarkets. At least 2,000 products and services have been developed and commercialized as a result of American space exploration. GPS has helped us find each other, computer chips allow us to see and talk to one another [inaudible 00:22:13] by mountains and oceans, singing Happy Birthday and watching the first steps of that new baby grandchild, comforting each other when comfort is needed. Think about it what means to you and your loved ones. We just have to imagine again. I had a long discussion with Xi Jinping, the leader of China, when he called to congratulate me. We spent two hours on the phone and he said, and it was astonished, my NASA security team and the China experts were on the line, he said, “You’ve always said, Mr. President, that you can define America in one word, possibilities.” That’s who we are. In America, anything’s possible. Like what we did in the vaccines a decade ago that laid the foundation for COVID-19 vaccines we have today. Like we did when the interstate highway system that transformed the way we traveled, lived, worked and developed. Americans could visit relatives anywhere in the country with just a family station wagon, a business here in Pittsburgh could load up a truck and get a product to Portland or Phoenix. To this day, about a quarter of all the miles Americans drive each year are on one of those very original highways. Imagine what we can do, what’s within our reach if we modernize those highways. You and your family could travel coast to coast without a single tank of gas, on board a high-speed train. We can connect high-speed, affordable, reliable internet wherever you live. Imagine knowing that you are handing your children and grandchildren a country that will lead the world in producing clean energy technology, and we’ll need to address one of the biggest threats of our time. That’s what we’ll do. All together, along with the American Rescue Plan, the proposal I put forward will create millions of jobs, estimated by some Wall Street outfits of 18 million jobs over four years, good paying jobs. It also works to level the playing field to empower workers and ensure that the new jobs are good jobs, that you can raise a family on, and ensure a free and fair choice to organize and bargain collectively. That’s why my plan asked Congress to pass the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, the PRO Act, and send it to my desk. This plan is important, not only for what and how it builds, but it’s also important to where we build. It includes everyone, regardless of your race, your zip code. Too often, economic growth and recovery is concentrated on the coast. Too often, investments have failed to meet the needs of marginalized communities left behind. There’s talent innovation everywhere and this plan connects that talent through cities, small towns, rural communities, through our businesses and our universities, through our entrepreneurs, union workers, all across America. We have to move now, because I’m convinced that if we act now, in 50 years, people are going to look back and say this was the moment that America won the future. What I’m proposing is a one-time capital investment of roughly $2 trillion in America’s future, spread largely over eight years. It will generate historic job growth, historic economic growth, help businesses to compete internationally, create more revenue as well. They are among the highest value investments we can make in the nation, investing in our infrastructure, but put another way, failing to make these investments adds to our debt and effectively puts our children at a disadvantage relative to our competitors. That’s what crumbling infrastructure does, and our infrastructure is crumbling. It ranked 13th in the world. What’s more, it heightens our vulnerability, it attracts our adversaries to compete in ways that they haven’t up to now. Our adversaries are worried about us building this critical infrastructure. Put simply, these are investments we have to make. We can afford to make them, or put another, we can’t afford not to. So how do we pay for it? I spoke to the majority leader, I guess he’s no longer the majority leader, he has been for a long time. I spoke to the Republic leader about the plan. … leader about the plan. Everybody’s for doing something on infrastructure. Why haven’t we done it? Well, no one wants to pay for it. Less than four years ago, as I said, the Congress passed a tax cut of two trillion dollars, increasing the national debt two trillion dollars. It didn’t meet virtually any of the predictions it would in terms of growing the economy. Overwhelmingly, the benefits of that tax package went to the wealthiest Americans. It even included new investments that you’d profit by shifting profits in jobs overseas, if you’re a corporation. It was bad for American competitiveness, deeply unfair to the middle-class families, and wrong for our future. Here’s what I do. I start with one rule: No one, let me say it again, no one making under $400,000 will see their federal taxes go up, period. This is not about penalizing anyone. I have nothing against millionaires and billionaires. I believe in American capitalism. I want everyone to do well, but here’s the deal, right now a middle-class couple, a firefighter and a teacher with two kids making a combined salary of say 110, $120,000 a year pays 22 cents for each additional dollar they earn in federal income tax. But a multinational corporation that builds a factory abroad, brings it home to sell it, they pay nothing at all. We’re going to raise the corporate tax. It was 35%, which was just too high. We all agreed five years ago, it should go down to 28%, but they reduced it to 21%. We’re going to raise it back up to 28%. No one should be able to complain about that. It’s still lower than what that rate was between World War II and 2017. Just doing that one thing will generate one trillion dollars in additional revenue over 15 years. In 2019, an independent analysis found that there are 91, let me say it again, 91 Fortune 500 companies, the biggest companies in the world, including Amazon that use various loopholes so they pay not a single, solitary penny in federal income tax. I don’t want to punish them, but that’s just wrong. That’s just wrong. A fireman and a teacher paying 22%? Amazon and 90 other major corporations paying zero in federal taxes? I’m going to put an end to that. Here’s how we’ll do it. We’re establishing a global minimum tax for US corporations at 21%. We’re going to level the international playing field. That alone will raise one trillion dollars over 15 years. We’ll also eliminate deductions by corporations for offshoring jobs and shifting assets overseas. You do that, you pay a penalty. You don’t get a reward in my plan. And use the savings from that to give companies tax credits to locate manufacturing here and manufacturing and production here in the United States. We’ll significantly ramp up the IRS enforcement against corporations who either fail to report their income or under report. It’s estimated that could raise hundreds of billions of dollars. All this adds up to more than what I proposed to spend in just 15 years. It’s honest. It’s fiscally responsible. And by the way, as the experts will tell you, it reduces the debt, the federal debt over the long haul. But let me be clear, these are my ideas on how to pay for this plan. Others have additional ideas, let them come forward. I’m open to other ideas so long as they do not impose any tax increase on people making less than $400,000. Let me close with this. Historically, infrastructure had been a bipartisan undertaking, many times led by Republicans. It was Abraham Lincoln who built the Transcontinental Railroad; Dwight Eisenhower, Republican, the interstate highway system. I could go on. I don’t think you’ll find a Republican today in the House or Senate, maybe I’m wrong, gentlemen, who doesn’t think we have to improve our infrastructure. They know China and other countries are eating our lunch. There’s no reason why it can’t be bipartisan again. The divisions of the moment shouldn’t stop us from doing the right thing for the future. I’m going to bring Republicans into the Oval Office, listen to them, what they have to say and be open to other ideas. We’ll have a good-faith negotiation with any Republican who wants to help get this done. But we have to get it done. I truly believe we’re in a moment where history is going to look back on this time as a fundamental choice having been made between democracies and autocracies. There’s a lot of autocrats in the world who think the reason why they’re going to win is democracies can’t reach consensus any longer. Autocracies do. That’s what competition between America and China and the rest of the world is all about. It’s a basic question: Can democracies still deliver for their people? Can they get a majority? I believe we can. I believe we must. Delivering for the American people is what the American Rescue Plan was about, and it’s been overwhelmingly popular when I wrote it. Everybody said I had no bipartisan support. We’re overwhelming bipartisan support with registered Republican voters. Ask around. If you live in a town with a Republican mayor, a Republican county executive, or a Republican governor, ask him how many would rather get rid of the plan. Ask him if it helped him at all. It’s what the American Job Plan is about. The new one I’m proposing. I hope Republicans in Congress will join this effort. I hope, and I believe, a number of businesses will join this effort. I hope, and I believe, the American people will join this effort. Democrats, Republican, Independents. We can do this. We have to do this. We will do this. We just have to remember, this is the United States of America. I’ve said it a thousand times, there’s nothing beyond our capacity if we act together. It’s time to move together. Thank you, and I hope I get to come back to see you folks after this plan is passed, and the question is you have to attract even more apprentices, more people because we’re building so much. God bless you all and may God protect our troops."
"54","04-04-21"," Jill and I want to send you our warmest Easter greetings to you and your family. As we celebrate this most holy day, we know many are still going without familiar comforts of the season. The virus is not gone, and so many of us still feel the longing and loneliness of distance. For a second year, most will be apart from their families, their friends, the full congregations that fill us with joy. And yet, as the Gospel of John reminds us, the light shines in the darkness and the darkness has not overcome it. The traditions of Holy Week take us on a journey from sorrow to salvation, reminding us that with faith, hope, and love, anything is possible. And today, as spring returns, we see hope all around us. Families are getting the financial help they need to take a breath once again. Businesses are recovering and more and more Americans are getting life-saving vaccines. We share the sentiments of Pope Francis, who said that getting vaccinated is a moral obligation, one that can save your life and the lives of others. By getting vaccinated and encouraging your congregations and your communities to get vaccinated, we not only can beat this virus, we can also haste the day when we can celebrate the holidays together again. This Easter, from our family to yours, we wish you health, hope, joy, and the peace of God, which passes all understanding. Happy Easter, everyone. May the Lord bless you and keep you."
"55","04-05-21"," Good afternoon. Jill and I thank you for joining us today. And we have a special guest, as you can see to my left here. I’m thankful to our friends at the White House Historical Association and the National Park Service for helping us deliver thousands of commemorative eggs to vaccination sites, and communities, and healthcare centers all across America. Easter’s a day of joy when we celebrate resurrection and renewal. But this year, we know many are still going without the familiar comforts of the season. The virus is not gone, and the second year in a row most will be apart from their families, their friends in a full congregation that fill us with so much joy. But the scripture tells us, “Joy cometh in the morning. As we celebrate the renewal of this season, we know that long for dawn is almost here. We will rebuild our nation, we will reengage and reimagine what we can be. We’ll remember that with faith, hope, and love, anything is possible. And we’ll look forward to next year when the White House will ring with joy the season once again, and there’ll be an Easter Egg Roll, God willing. And God bless you all, may God protect our troops and take care of the Easter Bunny. Thank you all very, very much. All right, stand in the middle, Easter Bunny. Right here, get in the middle. There you go, right here. Come here, Easter Bunny. All right, nice to see you all. Here you go. Here Easter Bunny, here you go. He can’t even see. There we go. You got to squeeze. You got it, man. All right, thank you all."
"56","04-06-21"," [inaudible 00:01:09] we should be doing this outside. Good afternoon everyone. I just visited a vaccination clinic in Virginia at the Virginia Theological Seminary in Alexandria, Virginia. The seminary and other houses of worship in the area are partnering with the community health centers to offer vaccination and vaccination sites. They’re seeing these kinds of partnerships we’re in, not just there, but we’re seeing them all over the country. People are coming together across the different faiths to serve those most in need with special focus on vaccinating seniors from all races, backgrounds and walks of life. It’s an example from America at its finest and they’re all meeting what Pope Francis calls, the moral obligation get vaccinated. Something which [inaudible 00:02:07] say can save your life and the lives of others. And I was at the seminary clinic to mark an important milestone as well. Yesterday we crossed 150 million shots in 75 days, the first 75 days of my administration. On our way to hitting our goal of 200 million shots by the hundredth day in office. That of course is the new goal I said, after passing the original mark of 100 million shots in my first hundred days. Doing that in just 58 days. At the time, some said a hundred million shots was too ambitious. And then they said it wasn’t ambitious enough. Well, we got to keep moving if we could raise it up higher, I’d do that as well. But we know, we know what we have to do, we have to ramp up a whole of government approach that rallies the whole country and puts us on a war footing to truly beat this virus. And that’s what we’ve been doing. Getting enough vaccine supply, mobilizing more vaccinators, creating more places to get vaccinated and we’re now administrating an average of 3 million shots per day, over 20 million shots a week. On Saturday alone, we reported more than 4 million shots were administered. We’re the first country to administer 150 million shots and the first country to fully vaccinate over 62 million people. But here’s the deal. I promised an update to the American people every 50 millionth shot. And I’m already back to update you a little over two weeks, two and a half weeks later. I promised in the beginning that I’d always give you the straight scoop straight from the shoulder, the good and the bad. Well here’s the truth. The good news is we’re on track to beat our goal of 200 million shots in the first hundred days. More than 75% of the people over the age of 65 have gotten shots, up from 8% when we took office. That’s a dramatic turnaround and critical because seniors account for 80% of all COVID deaths. To help support my goal of safely or opening the majority of K through eight schools by my hundredth day in office, I directed states in early March to make educators and childcare workers eligible for vaccines and to get a goal of getting all who wanted the vaccination to be able to have one and to do it in the month of March. I’m pleased to report according to CDC estimates, over 80% of teachers, school staff and childcare workers received at least one shot by the end of March. And that’s great progress, protecting our educators, our essential workers. And because our vaccine program is in overdrive, we’re making it easier to get a vaccination shot. Last week, I announced that by April 19th of this month, 90% of all Americans will be within five miles of a vaccination site. And further good news is that we’re getting more and more data on just how effective the vaccines are. Dr. Fauci recently cited two studies from the New England Journal of Medicine that found fully vaccinated care workers, healthcare workers on the front lines had extremely low infection rates, less than two tenths of 1% compared to unvaccinated healthcare workers, quite considerably higher infection rates. So we’re making incredible progress. There’s a lot of good news but there’s also some bad news. New variants of the virus are spreading and there’s moving quickly. Cases are going back up. Hospitalizations are no longer declining while deaths are still down, down way down from January, they’re going up in some places. So you might ask, everybody’s asking, what does that mean? I understand that people may find it confusing that the vaccination program is saving tens of thousands of lives, but the pandemic remains dangerous. Let me explain it in a single word, time, time. Even moving at the record speed we’re moving at, we’re not even halfway through vaccinating over 300 million Americans. This is going to take time. Remember, for a two dose vaccine, it takes weeks from the time you get your first one until you’re able to get your second shot which makes you fully protected. If you get your first shot next week in mid April, you won’t be fully protected until May, late May. If you get your first shot in mid May, you aren’t fully protected until late June. So look, now on the one hand, June isn’t that far away given how long this has been going on, but it isn’t here yet either. So the virus is spreading because we have too many people who seen the end in sight, think we’re at the finish line already. But let me be deadly earnest with you, we aren’t at the finish line. We still have a lot of work to do. We’re still in a life and death race against this virus. Until we get more people vaccinated, we need everyone to wash their hands, socially distance and mask up in a recommended mask from the CDC. Think about it this way, better times are ahead. And as I said before, we can have a safe, happy 4th of July with your family and your friends and small groups in your backyard. The real question is how much death, disease and misery are we going to see between now and then? In January, just the month of January we lost 95,774 Americans. In March, that was 37,172 Americans. All told y’all I keep doing this I know, but I carry this card every day with my schedule on it and on the back I have a COVID update. The total number of deaths in the United States to date is 554,064 dead. That’s lives that had been lost. What we do now, we’re going to determine how many people we’ll save or lose in the month of April and May and June before we get to July 4th. So please, until we’re further along in this accelerating successful but still growing vaccination effort, please wash your hands, practice social distances, wear a mask as recommended by the CDC, get vaccinated when it’s your turn. Why I’m asking Americans, the American people to do their job, here’s what I’m doing. When we first started our vaccination program, the real question was how quickly we could get shots in people’s arms. Well, by the end of May, the vast majority of all Americans will have gotten at least their first shot. That success is going to save lives and get this country back to normal sooner, but it’s not enough. On March the 11th, I announced that I was opening up all vaccination sites to all adults by May 1st. Many governors, Democrats and Republicans responded and decided to beat that day, which was good. Thanks to their hard work and the hard work of the American people and the hard work of my team, I’m announcing today that we’re moving that day up from May 1st to April 19th nationwide. That means by no later than April 19th in every part of this country, every adult over the age of 18, 18 or older will be eligible to be vaccinated. No more confusing rules, no more confusing restrictions. My message today is a simple one. Many states have already opened up to all adults, but beginning April 19th, every adult in every state, every adult in this country is eligible to get in line to get a COVID vaccination. And today in advance of that new national full eligibility date, I want to make a direct appeal to our seniors and everyone who cares about them. While we have made incredible progress vaccinating three quarters of our seniors and putting vaccination sites within five miles of 90% of the public, it still isn’t enough. It’s simple, seniors it’s time for you to get vaccinated now, get vaccinated now. To make it easier, my administration is sending aid to community groups to drive seniors to vaccination sites. We’re incredibly grateful to all the volunteers, houses of worship and civic groups that are helping us in this effort. This is America. We take care of one another. We have to keep it up. As we ask our seniors to sign up for their shots now, I also have a message for people under 65. If you know someone over 65 who has not gotten this life saving vaccine, call them now. Work with them to get their shots this week or next. Pick them up, drive them. It can be your parents, your grandparents, your aunt, uncle, your new neighbors. And finally, even after we opened up vaccinations to all adults and put a site within five miles of 90% of the public, we know there are many people who still struggle to get access to a shot. We know that there are a number of seniors and people with disabilities and people in many communities of color who may be isolated and lack access to transportation. That’s why we’re ramping up transportation to vaccination centers and deploying more mobile units and pop-up clinics in the places close to where people live. That’s why we’re working with faith-based organizations and other community groups to host vaccination clinics, sign people up for appointments, get help, help them get those appointments. That’s why we’re sending even more vaccines to community health centers like the one I was at today that all together serve nearly 30 million Americans, like the ones I visited today. Two thirds of the patients at community health centers live at or below the poverty level. 60% are racial and ethnic minorities. To reach them, we’re investing nearly $10 billion to expand testing, treatment and vaccinations for the hardest hit yet most underserved communities. Let me close with this. We vaccinated more people in than any other nation on earth. The vaccines have proven to be safe and effective. That should give us real hope, but we can’t let it make us complacent. Despite the progress we’re making as a nation, I want every American to know in no uncertain terms that this fight isn’t over. This progress we’ve worked so hard to achieve can be reversed. Now’s not the time to let down. Now’s not the time to celebrate. It’s time to do what we do best as a country, do our duty, our jobs, taking care of one another. And we can and we’ll do this, but we can’t let up now. My hope is before the summer’s over, I’m talking to you all about how we have even access to more vaccines than we need to take care of every American. And we’re helping other poor countries, countries around the world that don’t have the money, the time, the expertise. Because until this vaccine is available to the world and we’re beating back the virus in other countries, we’re not really completely safe. So we’ve made great progress. I’m still looking forward to the prospect that we keep the pace we’re on and we listen to one another and take the precautions that I talked about. That we would you be able to have a 4th of July, an independence day on July the fourth. As I defined about three weeks ago, I want to have an independence day an independence from the COVID. So you’re able to get in the backyard with a small group of people, of friends and neighbors and celebrate independence day because you’ve been vaccinated, because you’re safe, because you’re in the clear. May God bless you all and may God protect our troops. Thank you so much for listening. Thank you. I’ll report on that later. I think that’s up to the masters. Look, it is reassuring to see that for-profit operations and businesses are speaking up about how these new Jim Crow laws are just antithetical to who we are. There’s another side to it too. The other side to it too is when they in fact move out of Georgia, the people who need the help the most, people who are making hourly wages, sometimes get hurt the most. I think it’s a very tough decision for a corporation to make or group to make, but I respect them when they make that judgment and I support whatever judgment they make. But it’s the best way to deal with this is for Georgia and other states to smarten up, stop it, stop it, stop getting people [inaudible 00:17:37]. Despite your passionate appeal now, there are many Americans who are very reluctant to take the vaccine, especially in red states. We are, we are doing that. And by the way, the number of people who are reluctant to take it has continued to diminish, continue to diminish across the country. As they see their neighbors, particularly in communities that have been very, now there’s a different group of people. There’s a group of people who have been reluctant because of past, how can I say it? Past wrongs that have been done to them, experimentation, not sure that they’re being told the truth et cetera. But then there’s another group. It seems to me to be, I probably shouldn’t characterize it, but Mitch McConnell keeps speaking to them, which I give him credit for saying the idea that he said the polling data shows Republican men, particularly young men, don’t think they should have to take the vaccine. It’s their patriotic right not to do it, their freedom to choose. And he’s saying, no, no, take the vaccine, take the vaccine. And I’ll add a phrase he didn’t, but I think he believes it’s a patriotic responsibility you have. Last question. I have not. Look, I think the federal reserve is an independent operation. And starting off my presidency I want to be real clear that I’m not going to do the kinds of things that have been done in the last administration. Either talking to the attorney general about who he’s going to prosecute or not prosecute and under what circumstances or the fed telling them what they should and shouldn’t do. Even though that wouldn’t be the basis upon which I’d be talking to them. So I’ve been very fastidious about not talking to them. I do talk to the secretary of treasury. Thank you all very much. One more on COVID Mr. President, you mentioned 554,064 American dead from COVID 19. A lot of families want to know how this happened, how it got here. Have you had a chance to speak to any of your international partners, any of them. No, I have not had that conversation with president Xi. Thank you."
"57","04-07-20"," …VAF and the Pennsylvania AFL-CIO, your entire executive board for everything that you do, you continue to do and you’ve done so much, not only for Pennsylvania labor, but for labor nationally and for bringing us together today as well. I know you heard from some other important voices today like my friend Randi Weingarten of the AFT, but there’s no better friend I have than Bobby Casey. We go back a long way. We grew up in a neighborhood in Scranton that were literally four blocks away from one another, same parish, same schools. Although he went to Scranton Prep, I had gone, I’d left by that time. I was doing a virtual, almost the same kind of place I went to in Claymont, Delaware, little steel town. But Bobby, I don’t know whether you’re still there, but you’re a great friend and you have a wonderful family and I love your mother. She’s incredible. But at any rate, Bobby, you’re also fighting hard to make sure that this Trump administration can’t ignore the pain being felt every day across America, all across this country. Folks, I’m going to be honest with you. It’s going to be an incredibly hard week for the country. We’ve already lost thousands of Americans to this pandemic and we’re going to lose, I’m afraid many more in the days ahead. Dr. Fauci, the one consistent voice throughout this administration, and the public health experts are issuing dire warnings. The surgeon general has described this as the Pearl Harbor moment. And all of us are going to be pushed to our limits. None more than those in the front line, our healthcare workers, our first responders, our essential workers who literally are carrying our nation on their backs like labor has always done through this crisis. And I mean this from the bottom of my heart. My heart goes out to each and every individual who’s suffering because of this virus. The families who are grieving lost loved ones. The scared children of those frontline healthcare workers whose parents are working to save so many lives. And those workers have had their hours slashed, their lost their jobs entirely. Some of them are, they don’t know how long they’re going to make ends meet. And we’re being tested like never before. I mean like never before. But I know that we’re going to come through it. The American people have always led this country and led this country all the way through every crisis we’ve had. Ordinary people given an opportunity are capable of accomplishing extraordinary things. I’ve been saying this my whole life, but in the face of COVID-19, we’re seeing an incredible American grit and spirit shine through from every quarter. We’re seeing what solidarity means when you put it into action. We’re seeing something else, too. We’re we’re seeing without a doubt how important labor unions are to this country. Labor unions, especially in times of crisis. Who are the workers on the front lines of our national response? The doctors and nurses, the firefighters, the EMTs, the transit workers, the food service professionals, the grocery store clerks and stackers. They can focus on doing their job because their union is looking out for their needs. Fighting for protective gear like masks and gloves, pushing for sanitary conditions, pushing for appropriate cleaning protocols, hand-washing, making sure there are options for paid leave. The rest of us, those of us who are staying home to try to slow the spread of this virus, we owe them as well. We owe all of you who are out there though. All of you in the front lines, all of you. We owe the public employee union members more than we can pay them back. Who are the people have stepped up to make sure unemployment checks get out the door in Pennsylvania for Pennsylvania workers. It’s still underway. We’re behind the curve, but as quickly as possible, they’re moving. We owe the manufacturing unions that are demanding that we produce the PPE, the medical equipment, and the doctors and nurses who are needed in the front lines so desperately. We owe the airline unions and the service unions that fought to make sure Congress didn’t bail out large corporations without first ensuring they take care of their workers. And we need to make sure that the inspector general that’s in that legislation is an inspector general, holds these big corporations accountable. It’s about the workers, it’s about the workers and not only the workers, but the airline contractors like food and service and cleaning contractors. We owe all of our unions because you continue, as you always have, advocating for basic rights and needs of every worker, unionized or not, we wouldn’t have anything we have without unions. For paid sick leave, access to unemployment, access to unemployment insurance, safe and healthy workplace, and including a personal protective equipment that will keep all of us safe. And at least a $15 minimum wage. You fought for everything, not only for your union, but for people who are just need help. So many of our lowest paid workers have stepped up during this crisis and every American seeing them in action should support the right of those folks to be paid a living wage. As President Trump says, “One job should be enough.” These folks are putting themselves on the line every day, sacrificing so damn much, stepping up under dire circumstances do their job, not for themselves, for all of us. They’re essential in times of crisis and beyond, and they deserve not only to be paid fairly, but they deserve our respect. They deserve a safe workplace and a fair pay. That’s why it’s vital we make it easier for workers to join a union. For unions to organize and bargain collectively is the only counterweight we have. To have a National Labor Relation Board that actually is on the side of workers. Our frontline workers and essential workers are giving us their all. They deserve to have your government work as hard as they possibly can for all of you as you protect the rest of us. We need [inaudible 00:06:41] workplaces and holding employers accountable during this crisis and every day. That’s what we did in our administration during the H1N1 virus outbreak. Early on the Obama Biden administration, we had OSHA and the CDC issue detailed guidelines of how businesses should protect their workers and we enforced those guidelines. Then we worked for years to prepare for a new permanent OSHA standard on infectious disease. When we left office in 2017 it was ready to be proposed, but instead of taking action to protect workers against future pandemics, the Trump administration shelved it. Now, the AFL-CIO is having to fight to get Congress to force the Trump administration to issue an emergency temporary standard requiring all employers, all employers to protect against infectious disease. That shouldn’t be a fight. It’s basic. In a Biden administration, that standard already would be in place. I’ve said it many times. The coronavirus is not Donald Trump’s fault, but he does bear responsibility for our response and taking his duty seriously. It’s about doing the job as a president. His failures and his delays continue. We continue to see it. And it’s caused a real pain for so many Americans. Americans should be leading the world, marshaling a coordinated global response, both on the public health and on economic fronts. Giving our skilled union members what they need to manufacture the equipment, supplies and medicines we need now so we can take care of our people here at home and support the needs of vulnerable populations around the world. Unfortunately, President Trump is still not moving very quickly. Not quickly enough I should say that from my perspective. He’s not prioritizing workers. He’s not getting out of the way and let the scientists make the judgments. He’s not using all the authority he has under the federal law to make sure healthcare workers are getting equipped and the supplies they need. He’s not directing OSHA to enforce the law to protect workers from infectious disease. He’s not helping governors who are forced to bid against one another and the federal government to get what they need. Trump likes to say he’s a wartime president. Well, he needs a step up and act like it. I’ve offered him a 10 point plan. I call it the Make Work Checklist. It’s what the Trump administration needs to do to make sure that that $2 trillion in the Cares Act that Congress passed actually gets relief into the hands of as many American workers as possible as quickly as possible. Secondly, making sure that unemployment checks get out on time and in full. Third, pushing banks to get those government-backed small business loans out the door to every eligible small business so they can keep the workers on the payroll. Policing the way large corporations use their funds that they received to pay workers and their benefits. Opening up, this is really important. Opening up enrollment for Obamacare so the folks who are not covered like a lot of you are, thank God, who need insurance right now have a chance to get it. The president should be laser focused on keeping as many people employed as possible and making workers financially whole so that we weather this crisis, come back stronger as a nation like we always have in the past. Because once we break the infection curve and stem this public health crisis, we’re going to face an immense job of rebuilding this economy, but we can do it. We can do it. We can’t just return to an unfair and unequal economy that’s stacked against American workers. I’ve been saying all throughout this campaign, Wall Street and the CEO’s didn’t build this country. The middle class did. And the middle class was built by unions. Unions built the middle-class. And working families and unions will be the drivers of our success once again, when we get through this. Together, we’ll make sure that everyone has a chance to build a solid middle-class life for themselves and for their families in the 21st century economy. We know what that needs to look like. This will be our chance to make it real. Invest in our infrastructure, provide greater access to education and job training, affordably. Raising wages to protect workers and their overtime pay. Ensuring access to universal healthcare while guaranteeing that unions and union members can keep their current insurance if they choose. Protecting pension plans and above all, more union members, more unions, more collective bargaining everywhere in America, in the private sector and the public sector, in the federal government. Unions are the reason why so many workers right now have a fair wage, health insurance, retirement security, safe workplaces, paid sick leave, family leave. You won it at the bargaining table. You have a voice in your workplace and I promise you, I give you my word. I will fight alongside you to make sure every worker in America has the same protections, not just in time of crisis, but permanently. Look, you all know me pretty well. I promise you if I’m elected president in November, no one will fight harder for you, your families and your communities. I just want to say again, unions, some of you heard me say this before. My dad used to say the only way to deal with abuse of power is with power. You are the only power we have to take on corporate America as it oversteps its bounds. The Fair Labor Standards Act didn’t say it’s all right to have unions. It said the government should promote unions, promote unions, promote unions. And I want to promise you that’s what I’m going to do. Not just support unions, but promote formation of more unions. Take on those corporations that are spending $1 billion a year to make it difficult to organize, violating the law. So much to say, but I’m promise you, I’m not going to talk anymore. I know you’re all, you’ve had a lot of speakers, but again, Mr. President, thank you very much for having me. You really are, you really are the reason why we’re going to get through this. And I want to thank you for supporting our frontline workers. Thank you for your spirit of solidarity, having each other’s backs and know that I’ll have your back. I promise you. If there’s anything I can do to be helpful in the coming days or months, please don’t hesitate to reach out. I hope that each one of you and your families are staying safe and healthy in these difficult days. I’m thinking about you all. We need you more than we ever did. Mr. President, if there’s anything I can do you know you get me directly. I promise you I’ll do whatever I can and I know I’m locked in a basement like a lot of you are. But again, I want to thank you. I owe my career to you, a country owes its prosperity to you and I promise you, if I’m your president, I’m going to fight like hell to see your strength grows. I promise. Thank you and stay safe folks. Stay safe. God love you all. Thanks. Thank you so much, Vice President Biden for those truly powerful and inspiring remarks and your support of union members everywhere. And I notice on some of our comments, one of our members, a mine worker, obviously we don’t, you talked about all workers and that certainly includes those from a thousand feet underground. You’ve got it, man. A thousand feet in the air. I’ll tell you what, we got to take care of those miners. I come from Scranton. I watched it, as a kid I watched it die. I know it’s an entire culture. It’s not just a job. It’s more than that. And we owe them big. We owe them big. Anyway, I’m sorry. Keep talking. No, I appreciate it. A lot of times after somebody speaks, the applause happens, you work the rope line and we’re just so glad you could stay with us. And with that we’ll continue on unless you have a minute or two if somebody has a question. Sure, I’d be happy to take a question. Oh, that’s great. Ken Washington from a Laborers International Union. Kenny. Hey, thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Frank. I mean, Oh my God, Rick. It’s okay, Kenny, my name is Joe. I’m calling in because many of you knew that I lost a close family member at beginning of the month. It is two people who one calmed me down and one calmed my family down and one that calmed me down was Frank. Frank, I love you brother. But those kinds of words that you called me after she passed, pulled me together. And Joe, when you called me that night, you didn’t know that I had all of my young family members in there with me. And of course they didn’t believe you was on the phone. So I put it on speaker. You had them crying because the thing of it is you was able to share with them the feelings that they were having because you went through basically the same thing. And that’s why I believe that he’s our best choice to beat Trump because he understands what we go through every day. And I just wanted to say thank you. I didn’t get a chance to thank you that night, but I thank you. Thank you. Thanks. You need not thank me for a thing and I, look, you know how to get ahold of me through the staff. If you want me to pick up the phone and call the kids, I mean this sincerely, I’m happy to do it. Just check in, see how they’re doing. Sometimes it’s a lousy thing to go through. And I know a lot of people call you and say, “I know what it’s like,” and but unless they’ve been through it, it’s hard to know. And sometimes I found I got solace from people who had been through what I went through when I lost my wife and daughter in that accident. And my boys were [inaudible 00:17:44] when I lost my son Beau. I, a lot of people are going through a lot worse than I went through and they don’t have any of the help. They don’t have the family that you and I have, old buddy. And we got to remember them every single day. They get up every day, they put one foot in front of the other. And God, look what just happened to the Kennedy family. I mean, God almighty, talk about a starstruck family. I mean just keep them in your prayers, too. But I’m sorry we belong to the same terrible club. But the fact is that I really mean it. If you can think of, if you think about it I think I still have the phone number. I’m not going to do it unless you want me to, but I’m happy to call the kids. I really am. People called my kids when they were in a similar situation and it meant a lot. Anyway, Mr. President, thank you very much. And all you folks out there that are busting your neck saving us, all of you who are putting yourselves in harm’s way to save people’s lives, all of those union members and, yes, here’s what I hope comes out of all this. I hope will come out of all this is a better appreciation, I’m sure it will by people who don’t even think about unions or have been convinced that unions are a problem and watched, watched what happened. Watch the sacrifices you make. Watch the sacrifices you make to make sure that you’re protecting people you don’t even know. I said when I announced, you remember, Mr. President, I said we got to restore the soul of America. This is, you are the soul of America. It’s not hyperbole. You’re the soul of America. You’re getting up every day. You’re going out, you’re doing the jobs that no one else can do or are willing to do, and you’re risking your lives doing it. So we owe you. And I’m going to remind everybody when this is over. Thank you for taking the time. And I’m told that you have to sign off now. So appreciate your remarks. Thank you. So boy, what a great friend and a great personal story, Kenny. A remarkable vice president and human being that Joe is. Back to the resolutions. We had on the floor of the Resolutions Committee, resolutions that had been moved and seconded to support. So are there any discussion or comments on the resolution from the Union Label Committee? Seeing none, we’ll put up the poll for our two minutes and open the phone lines for those who want to vote on the phone."
"58","04-07-21"," That’s my plan to rebuild what I refer to as the backbone of America, through the American Jobs Plan. It’s not a plan that tinkers around the edges, it’s a once in a generation investment in America. Unlike anything we’ve done since we built the interstate highway system and won the space race decades ago. It’s the single largest investment in American jobs since World War II. And it’s a plan that puts millions of Americans in the work to fix what’s broken in our country, tens of thousands of miles of roads and highways, thousands of bridges in desperate need of repair. But it also is a blueprint for infrastructure needed for tomorrow, not just yesterday, tomorrow. For American jobs, for American competitiveness. Last week, I said that once congress is back from recess, I’d get to work right away because we have no time to lose. So here we are, Democrats, Republicans will have ideas about what they like and what they don’t like about our plan. That’s a good thing. That’s the American way. That’s the way democracy works. Debate is welcome. Compromise is inevitable, changes are certain. And the next few weeks, the vice president and I will be meeting with Republicans and Democrats to hear from everyone. And we’ll be listening, we’ll be open to good ideas and good faith negotiations. But here’s what we won’t be open to. We will not be open to doing nothing. Inaction simply is not an option. Now, since I announced this plan, I’ve heard from my Republican friends, many of them say it’s too big. They say, why not focus on traditional infrastructure. Fix what we’ve already got, the road and the highways that exists, and the bridges. I’m happy to have that debate but let me tell you my view. We are American. We don’t just fix for today, we build for tomorrow. 200 years ago, trains weren’t traditional infrastructure either until America made a choice to lay down tracks across the country. Highways weren’t traditional infrastructure until we allowed ourselves to imagine that roads could connect our nation across state lines. The idea of infrastructure has always evolved to meet the aspirations of American people and their needs, and it’s evolving again today. We need to start seeing infrastructure through its effect on the lives of working people in America. What is the foundation today that they need to carve out their place in the middle class to make it. To live, to go, to work, to raise their families with dignity. To ensure that good jobs will be there for their kids, no matter who they are or what zip code they live in. That’s what infrastructure means in the 21st century. It still depends on roads and bridges, ports and airports, rail and mass transit. But it also depends on having reliable high-speed internet in every home. Because today’s high speed internet is infrastructure. It depends on the electric grid, a grid that won’t collapse in a winter storm, or be compromised by hackers at home or abroad. It depends on investing in made in America goods from every American community, including those that have historically been left out, Black, Latino, Asian American, Native Americans, rural communities. Talk to folks around the country about what really makes up the foundation of a good economy. Ask a teacher or a childcare worker if having clean drinking water, non contaminated drinking water in our schools, in our childcare centers, is part of that foundation. When we know that the led in our pipes slows a child’s development when they drink that water. Ask the entrepreneur, who small business is destroyed by the second 100 year flood in the last 10 years in Iowa or wildfires in the west that burned five million acres last year, an area roughly the size of the entire state of New Jersey, more fires than ever. Or the devastating damage seen more frequent, more intense hurricanes and storms on the east and Gulf Coast. Ask all those farmers and small business owners and homeowners, whether investing in clean energy to fight the effects of climate change is part of infrastructure. Ask folks in rural America, were more than the 35% of the people lack of reliable high-speed internet limiting their ability to conduct business, or engage in remote learning for their schools. Ask them whether investing in internet access will lead to better jobs in town, new markets for farmers and better opportunities for their kids. And I’m serious about this. Ask the moms and dads in the sandwich generation, the folks carrying enormous personal financial strains trying to raise their children and care for their parents, their elderly parents, or members of their families with a disability. Ask them what sort of infrastructure they need to build a little better life, to be able to breathe a little. It’s expanded services for seniors, it’s home care workers go in and cook their mail, help them get around and live independently in their home, allowing them to stay in their homes and I might add saving Medicaid hundreds of millions of dollars in the process. It’s better wages and benefits and opportunities for caregivers who are disproportionately women, women of color and immigrants. Ask our wounded warriors and military families. To my Republican colleagues in congress, should we modernize VA hospitals, update them? Many of them are more than 50 years old. How about the estimate 450,000 post 9/11 veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder. When they make that emergency call or their husband, wife, son, daughter makes that call to the VA hospital, dad needs help we have to bring him in, and they hear you have to wait. We don’t have room now. Call me back in eight days, 10 days, 12 days. More suicides in the military then people getting shot. Is it really your position, my friends, that our veterans don’t deserve the most modern facilities, that can catch that cancer diagnosis quicker with access to better roads, cleaner water, high speed internet that delivers information faster and more of it. Above all infrastructure is about meeting the needs of a nation and putting Americans to work and being able to do and get paid for having good jobs. Plumbers and pipe fitters replacing those literally thousands of miles of dangerous led pipes. They’re still out there. Everybody remembers what happened in Flint. There’s hundreds of Flint’s all across America. How many of you know, when you send your child to school, the fountain they’re drinking out of is not fed by led pipe? How many of you know the school your child was in still has asbestos in the walls and lacks the ventilation? Is that not infrastructure? Line workers and electricians, main transmission lines for a modern grid. Over 500,000 charging stations on the highways we are going to build to accommodate electric vehicles, so we can own the future. Construction workers and engineers building modern hospitals and homes for American families. Healthcare workers, steel workers, folks who were I work in the cutting edge labs. 90% of the infrastructure jobs created by our American Jobs Plan can be filled by people who don’t have a college degree. 75% don’t need an associate’s degree. As I said last week, this is a blue collar blueprint for increasing opportunity for the American people. It also includes the biggest investment in non-defense research and development on record. It’s not part of my speech, but I promise you, you’re all going to be reporting over the next six to eight months how China and the rest of the world is racing ahead of us in the investments they have in the future. Attempting to own the future. The technology, quantum computing, investing significant amounts of money in dealing with cancer and Alzheimer’s. That’s the infrastructure of a nation. There’s a new book out about how we fallen behind. America’s no longer leader of the world because we’re not investing. It used to be we invested almost 2.7% of our GDP in infrastructure. Now it’s about 0.7%. When we were investing it we were the leader in the world. I don’t know why we don’t get this. One of the only few major economies in the world whose public investment in research and development has declined as a percentage of DGP in the last 25 years, declined. The United States of America that led the world. Why does this matter? Investing in research and development help lead to lithium batteries, LED technology, the internet itself. It helped lead to vaccine breakthroughs that are helping us beat COVID-19. To the Human Genome Project, which has led to breakthroughs in how we understand and fight cancer and other diseases. Government, meaning the taxpayers, funded this research. Government. We stopped investing in the research, we stop investing in the jobs of the future and we give up leading the world. When we do invest in research, what we’re really doing is raising the bar in what we can imagine. Imagine a world where you and your family can travel coast to coast without single tank of gas, or in a high-speed train, close to as fast as you can go across the country in a plane. Imagine your children growing up to work in innovation, good paying jobs and fields that haven’t even been invented yet. Like the parents of every computer programmer, every graphic designer, every renewable energy worker once did imagine. We invest today so that these jobs will be here in America tomorrow. So America can lead the world that is as it’s historically done. That’s why I brought back scientists into the White House. We need to think. Look, do we think the rest of the world is waiting around? We’re not going to make those kinds of investments the rest of world’s saying. Take a look. Do you think China is waiting around to invest in this digital infrastructure or in research and development? I promise you they are not waiting. But they’re counting on American democracy to be too slow, too limited, and too divided to keep pace. You’ve heard me say before, I think this generation can be marked by the competition between democracies and autocracies because the world is changing so rapidly. The autocrats are betting on democracy not being able to generate the kind of unity needed to make decisions to get in that race. We can’t afford to prove them right. We have to show the world. Much more importantly we have to show ourselves that democracy works. That we can come together on the big things. It’s the United States of America for God’s sake. Of course, building the infrastructure of tomorrow requires major investments today. As I said, last week, I’m open to ideas about how to pay for this plan. With one exception, I will not impose any tax increases on people making less than $400,000 a year. If others have ideas out there on how to pay for this investment without violating that rule they should come forward. There’s all kinds of opportunities just list all tax breaks that I find difficult to explain. Wealthy deductions, $360 billion if you cap them, top rate of 39% which it used to be for years, all the way to the Bush administration, almost a quarter of a trillion dollars corporate minimum tax and the fossil fuel giveaways of $40 billion, et cetera. I could go on. Let me tell you what I proposed, how to do it. We’re going to raise the corporate tax rate, it was 35% for the longest time, which was too high. Barack and I thought it was too high during our administration. We all agreed five years ago, as should come down somewhat. But the previous administration reduced it all the way down to 21%. What I’m proposing is that we meet in the middle 28%. 28% will still have lower corporate rates than any time between World War II and 2017. It will generate over a trillion dollars in taxes over 15 years. New independent study put out last week, found that at least 55 of our largest corporations use the various loopholes to pay zero federal income tax in 2020. It’s just not fair. It’s not fair to the rest of the American taxpayers. We’re going to try to put an end to this. Not fleece them. 28%. If you’re a mom and dad, a cop, firefighter, police officer, et cetera you’re paying close to that in your income tax. I’ve also proposed a global minimum tax, which has been proposed around the world for US corporations of 21% percent. Let me tell you what that means. It means that companies aren’t going to be able to hide their income in places like the Cayman Islands and Bermuda, in tax havens. We’re going to also eliminate deductions used by corporations for offshoring jobs and shifting assets overseas. They offshore the job shift the assets overseas and then don’t have to pay taxes and all they make. There. We’ll significantly ramp up IRS enforcement against corporations and the super wealthy who either fail to report their income or under reported estimated that would raise tens of billions of dollars. And it adds up to more than what I proposed in just 15 years. It’s honest, it’s fair, it’s fiscally responsible and it pays for what we need and reduce the debt over the long haul. And by the way, I didn’t hear any of our friends who were criticizing this plan, say that the corporate tax cut which added $2 trillion to the debt, the Trump tax cut, two trillion, $1.9 trillion in debt, wasn’t paid for. The vast majority of which went to the top 1% of the wage earners. I didn’t hear anybody hollering in this recovery, the so-called, before I became president. This K-shaped recovery, where billionaires made 300 billion more dollars during this period. Where’s the outrage there? Not trying to punish anybody, but dammit. maybe it’s because I come from middle-class neighborhood, I’m sick and tired of ordinary people being fleeced. Let me close by saying this. Whatever partisan divisions there are around other issues, there don’t have to be around this one. The divisions of the moment shouldn’t stop us from doing the right thing for the future. These aren’t Republican bridges, democratic airports, Republican hospitals or democratic power grid. Think of the transcontinental railroad, interstate highway system or the space race, we’re one nation united and connected. As I said last week, I’m going to bring Republicans to the White House, I invite them to come. We’ll have good faith negotiations and any Republican who wants to get this done, I invite, I invite them. We have to get this things done. We’re at an inflection point in American democracy. This is a moment where we prove whether or not democracy can deliver. Whether it can lay the foundation for an economy built from the bottom up in the middle out, not trickle down economics from the very top. Whether it can lay a good foundation for good jobs in the 21st century economy. Tell the kids, the young people that work for me, I told my kids, when I go on college campuses, they’re going to see more change in the next 10 years then we’ve seen the last 50 years. We’re going to talk about commercial aircraft flying at subsonic speeds, supersonics speeds. Be able to figuratively, if we decided to do it traverse the world in about an hour, traveled 21,000 miles an hour. So much has changed. We have got to lead it. I believe democracy can come through when the American people come together. We saw it in the American Rescue Plan. We’re seeing it with the jobs plan. The American Rescue Plan, which got so badly criticized, how many of my Republican colleagues you’ve seen gone on your stations or your newspapers and say boy, people in my state really like it, because it would be improper, haven’t asked for permission. The number of Republicans and Democrats who were hesitant to call me saying, God this really works. Overwhelming majority of the American people, Democrats Republicans, and Independents support infrastructure investments that meets the moment. So I urge the congress, listen to your constituents and together we can lay a foundation for an economy that works for everyone, allows America to remain the world leader. When we do that, I believe as I said last week, that in 50 years from now, when people look back, they’ll say this was the moment, together, that we won America’s future. I really believe that. Thank you all. And God bless you. And may God protect our troops. Thank you. Mr. I’m willing to listen to that. I’m wide open to, but we got to pay for this. We got to pay. There’s many other ways we can do it, but I’m willing to negotiate that. I’ve come forward with the best, most rational, way in my view, the fairest way to pay for it. But there are many other ways as well, and I’m open. Look, what I said was I would try to work with my friends on the other side. There are things we’re working on, together. Some of which we passed and some we will pass. But the last plan I laid out what was available, what I was suggesting and how I’d deal with it and a bi-partisan group came to see me. And then a Republican group came to see me and they started off at $600 billion and that was it. If they come forward with a plan that did the bulk of it, it was a billion, three or four, two or three, that allowed me to have pieces of all of this in there, I would have been prepared to compromise. But they didn’t, they didn’t move an inch, not an inch. But for example, I am dealing with a bipartisan group that came to see me. That was about what three, four weeks ago, when they came about computer chips. They said, look, we have to have our own supply. We have to work together. We’re working on that. Chuck Schumer and I think McConnell are about to introduce a bill along those lines. So I’m prepared to work, I really am. But to automatically say that the only thing that’s infrastructure is a highway at bridge or whatever, that’s just not rational. It really isn’t. I think the vast majority of Americans think everything from the sewer pipes to the sewer facilities, to the water pipes, I think their infrastructure. Anyway, thank you all so very much. [crosstalk 00:24:25]. What are you going to do on guns, Mr. I’ll be talking to you about that, I think, the day after tomorrow. Can you tell us what you told the King of Jordan, Mr. President? Are you concerned about the situation there. No, I’m not. I just called to tell him that he has a friend in America. Stay strong."
"59","04-09-20"," [inaudible 00:00:30]. Okay. Good afternoon and welcome to everybody who is joining us from across the country. I’m State Senator Yvanna Cancela. I represent the most Vegasy of Vegas districts in the heart of the silver state of Nevada. It is an honor and a privilege to be here today with you all virtually and getting to introduce the vice president. I’d be remiss if I didn’t acknowledge what a tremendous day this is for the campaign. Certainly some folks need to vote at the convention, but Joe Biden will be the democratic nominee and I could not think of a better leader for our country in this moment. We know that hundreds of thousands of people are full of insecurity, and fear, and looking for real leadership, leadership that is not being provided by Donald Trump. It is unbelievable that there are people who are absolutely in dire need of guidance and of the sentiment that things will get better. There’s no one better equipped to offer the leadership and guidance that we need as a country, not only in this moment, but in the time that we’ll need to get through this crisis than Joe Biden. We’ll hear today from workers who, like you, like me, are looking for that kind of leadership. What I know about Joe Biden, and what you know about Joe Biden, is that he has the empathy, the vision, and the boldness to be the leader that we need and to be the leader that frankly makes me feel better about the future of our country. I could not be more proud to support him. I’m thrilled to have the opportunity to moderate this discussion today. You don’t want to hear from me. You want to hear from the next president of the United States, Mr. Joe Biden. Thank you, Senator. You’ve been incredible. You were incredible for me before the Nevada caucus, during and after. I think you’re one of the great future leaders of this country. I really mean it. You’ve really done a heck of a job and you’re so well respected. Look, folks, I want to say good evening and thank you for taking the time to speak with me. I want this to be a conversation where I get to hear your stories and you get to ask me questions that are on your mind. I’ll just say a few things to the head start here. It’s going to take me about 10 minutes to do it. Earlier today, my good friend, and he is a friend, Bernie Sanders announced he was suspending his campaign. Bernie’s always been a passionate voice for progress and he put his heart and soul, not only in the running for president, but also the causes and issues he has been dedicated to his whole life. He’s inspired and energized millions of supporters, especially young voters, to join him in championing a progressive vision for our country. He didn’t just run a political campaign. He created a movement and that’s a good thing for the nation and for our future. While Bernie’s campaign has ended, I know his leadership’s going to continue, including working to address the incredible challenges we’re now facing, the ones that are facing this nation under this president. My heart goes out to everyone out there suffering from COVID-19. We all know the greatest tragedy in all of this is how many lives are being lost, how many are infected and suffering alone. One friend, her mother was dying of another illness of cancer and she’s in the hospital, but she couldn’t go and see her. They had to put a phone up to her ear. It’s so, so hard for so many people. This is going to continue to be a very hard week for our country. This disease is not only tearing through the nation, it’s devastating families. It’s wrecking the economy and we’re starting to see it magnify some of our worst systemic inequities. Early data shows countries and counties in this country have major black populations and Hispanic populations, the coronavirus infection rates in the black communities are three times as high as they are in white majority residents’ communities. Death rates, nearly six times higher. That’s unconscionable and never should happen. We need more data. We also need more data on how the Latino and other communities of color are impacted, other minority communities, so we know exactly what has to be done. Black Americans are still less likely to be insured as are Latinos, less likely to have access to healthcare, less likely to have had treatment for underlying conditions like asthma and diabetes to make them more vulnerable to this virus today. They’re more likely to face exposure to pollutants than anyone else associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Their death rates are higher. Black Americans are also less likely to have a job they can do just from home. Like many Latinos in America, they’re more likely to have to choose between their health, and their healthcare, and their paycheck. This virus is shedding light on the structural racism that still exists and plagues our laws, our institutions, and our culture. These past few weeks have been devastating for our economy. We’re going to have to do an awful lot of work to rebuild after this is over. As I said over and over in the past weeks, I believe that a top priority for us is using the money, the $2 trillion from the so called Cares Act that Congress passed, to keep as many workers on payroll as possible so they can hit the ground running, but so many people, including some of you, have already lost your jobs. 6.6 million new unemployment claims just reported last week. Who knows what it’s going to be this coming week. 3.3 million the week before. We’re getting more reporting tomorrow. That’s already more than 10 million Americans who’ve lost their jobs through no fault of their own because of this pandemic. Hospitality workers, I need not tell you about that, Senator, and in Las Vegas. Service industry workers, highly skilled workers in construction, so many more, union members and nonunion members. I know people are worried, not just if you or your loved one are going to get sick. You’re worried about how you’re going to make the rent, worried about how to pay the bills, keep food on the table, worried about when the relief checks are going to come through that have been voted by the Congress. That’s the key part of the 10 point, what I call, make work checklist that I put together last week and offered to the President of the United States, President Trump, so that he knows how to think about what it takes to administer a massive federal recovery program. One of the key pieces is making sure to get those unemployment checks out on time and in full. We have to make workers who have been laid off financially whole. States are already overwhelmed by the millions of claims with more to come. States need more staff, better technology, more robust systems to both accept claims and get those funds out the door. The White House should have had their back. We need to get those relief checks into the hands of folks as quickly as possible using direct deposits, prepaid debit cards, whenever we can, but here’s what we know above all. The money and the plans that are in the Cares Act won’t be enough in the first time around. We’re going to have to do more. The unemployment insurance payments, they will have to keep people afloat. Right now, they’re set to expire. These payments should be available as long as they are needed. The federal government should backstop the states on this to make sure that they continue to make those payments. We should have a rent freeze and a moratorium on evictions during this public health crisis because no one should have to worry about losing their home during a pandemic or where they live during a pandemic. The next package, this is already being discussed, should include student debt relief for at least $10,000 per person to help ease the burden on young people who were already struggling to get by before the coronavirus. We have to make sure everyone has access to maintain affordable health insurance coverage. We should be making it easier, not harder. Let me put it another way. It makes no sense. It makes no sense to be fighting in court right now to try to take away Obamacare from people who need it more than ever. It makes no sense not to open up a new enrollment period in the middle of this pandemic so that people who need insurance can get it now. As we look at the next steps that are needed, we should boost the subsidies for Obamacare, give them affordable coverage. The same goes for Cobra. You all know what Cobra subsidies are. When the president and I were in charge of pulling the country back from the great recession and rebuilding our economy in 2009, we made sure the subsidies were up to 65%. This crisis is going to be even bigger, so our support for the American people is going to need to be even more generous. By the way, Cobra kicks in when your insurance you have with your company no longer is available to you. The government should pick up the full cost of Cobra premiums right now. One additional tragedy of this crisis is how much pain could have been avoided with swift decision action and decisive action. This is a challenge that requires leadership. It requires transparency and it requires urgency. America’s longterm recovery is going to require far more investment, but it needs to be smart and effective. We can’t just return to an unfair, unequal economy that’s stacked against American workers. We already know we’re going to need more resources, a lot more. More people are going to need help. Let’s start now so we don’t waste valuable time. Let’s get help to the people who need it the most. I know that we’ll come through this challenge stronger than ever, just as we have every crisis we’ve ever faced in this nation. There’s nothing Americans can’t achieve when we do it together. I’m anxious to hear your questions, but I tell you what, I promise you we will get through this. You’ve heard me talk about the soul of America, Senator, and I talk about we need to restore it. We’re seeing the soul of America and all the workers I’m going to be talking to today, all the people all across the country, they’re not asking whether you’re a Muslim or a Christian. They’re not asking whether you’re a Latino or you’re not. Whenever you need, people reaching out. Look at all of first responders, how they’re risking their lives without the equipment they need to help people. It makes me proud to be an American, proud. It really does. This is the soul of America. We’re seeing it now. As a consequence, when we get through this, we’re going to be able to do so much better than we’ve done in the past. Let me stop now and take any questions you all may have. I’ll leave it to you, Senator, how we go from here. Thank you, Mr. Vice President. I always feel better hearing your leadership and hearing the way you can very quickly get to what needs to happen. I’m so grateful that you are pushing our current administration on what needs to happen. There are workers across the country that are feeling the devastation of layoffs, are afraid of what this means for the industries they work in. Today, we have a couple of workers joining us who are going to share their stories. We’ll take some questions from folks who are watching in between, but to kick us off this evening is Lavette Jacobs from Boston. Ms. Jacobs, I’m giving the floor to you. I’m good, Joe. It’s all right. I’m doing well given the circumstances. Good. Good. I had a question. Well, first let me introduce myself. I know my name is Lavette. IBW. Yes, IBW, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers 103. I’m an active member. I’m a single mom of an amazing 12 year old boy. I was currently employed, working in downtown Boston when the pandemic hit of COVID-19. Unfortunately I was unemployed. It’s been a process, a lot of anxiety and things of that nature. Sure. I’m doing the best I can to get by. I had a question for you, actually. Fire away. I wanted to know. … to get relief as quickly as possible when it comes to the unemployment process. Well, look, first of all, you’re going to get through this kiddo. I know it’s scary. I really do. I have a clear sense of it. I’ve been talking to an awful lot of workers all across the country, and so many people are in your shoes, Lovette. Over 10 million Americans have filed for unemployment claims during the last two weeks in March. It’s likely that millions more have filed a claim sensitive and millions of families worry how they’re going to make the rent, how they’re going to pay the bills, how they’re going to keep food on the table. We’ve never seen anything like this before in all of our history, including during the Great Depression. The recent bill that’s called the Cares Act, that the Congress passed was a good step. For the average American, their employees should be kept on the payroll. That’s that’s the whole point of the legislation. Tell businesses, “Keep the workers on the payroll.” For those who are not kept on the payroll, there’s extended unemployment benefits with an added $600 per week, which means that if you’re making under $75,000 a year, up to $75,000, you’d be made whole with whatever your salary is. We have to get those payments out the door fast and I was confident that they weren’t going to know how to do this once this got passed. We got to get it on time and in full to make every family whole and it’s a massive undertaking. Just look at the unemployment claims. As I said, almost 10 million in two weeks. That’s several times the prior record, which is an awful record to be breaking. States need immediate help with staffing, technology and training to handle this tidal wave. If you go to the unemployment office in Boston, they’re way over burdened and some laid off workers are waiting over a month to collect their unemployment checks. Now, a lot more needs to be done, a lot. I’ve called off for the President to one, issue clear guidelines so that all Americans understand the benefits they’re entitled to. It’s hard even to go to one place and know what the benefits you’re entitled to are. Create an unemployment delivery team to help States get assistance out as quickly as possible, including boosting funding for the State staffs to be able to handle and get the information out federally and the States to be able to create and follow through. There’s a thing called the Defense Production Act. You heard a lot about it because you heard me starting to call for the President to employ it a while ago. Defense Production Act allows the President as if it were a war to declare that he can take over the production of certain things. For example, remember how he dilly dallied, as my mother used to say, insisting that General Motors stop making cars and start to make ventilators? He finally ordered them to make the ventilators. Well, we have to make sure that in fact that Defense Production Act applies not only to getting people what they need to protect themselves, but we should have a Bank Defense Production Act. Let me make sure that you understand what I’m saying about that. We’ve got to make sure the banks, the big banks, are willing to provide for and deliver, make sure that there’s unemployment payments are prioritized first and foremost and require the use of electronic payments that are invalid or able to be paid for electronically, your unemployment, prepaid debt cards for people without a bank account and deliver direct cash relief fast as we can get it. Family shouldn’t have to wait for President Trump to sign a check. We have to work with Congress to extend and boost unemployment benefits. That is the extra $600 however long this crisis lasts, not just for the month, for however long this crisis last, so your unemployment check will be there every month for the entire month for as long as this crisis lasts. Look, Congress has to start working on the fourth relief bill out there. We have to get more relief, including a freeze and a halt on foreclosures and evictions so people don’t have to worry where they’re going to be out in the street. We have to restart the economy. There’s only one path forward, beat the virus, but let me hold for a second here and say one of the thing. There’s a provision in the law that was passed that every person out there would get a direct payment through the IRS of a $1,200 payment beyond their health insurance, excuse me, beyond their unemployment insurance. If you have a child, you get an extra $500. The IRS should have already set up and get to you, for example, a check for $1,700, direct cash payment for every American out there so they can get through this very difficult period. For a while, Trump was talking as if we had to choose between our public health and our economy, but they’re inextricably linked. This virus is why we have an economic crisis and no amount of economic relief will matter if we don’t bend, you hear a lot about the inflection curve, how we got to bend that curve. Instead of going up and up and up has got to come down and flatten out. We have to do that as quickly as possible to stop the spread and save lives. That’s priority number one. The two things that we have to make sure you have a place to go to is when you go to your employment office, they’re able to pay you what you are entitled under the law and it’s an added $600 bonus from whatever the state had was going to pay before, essentially rendering you whole up to $75,000 and I know that’s not what you’re making right now. I assume that’s not what you’re making now, but up to that amount of money and the direct cash payment that we sent to you in the mail to your address that the Congress voted for through the IRS. There are the things we have to do and we got to get them to now. in addition, this next time around, this next bill, they’re going to have to pass, We’re already talking about it as they also have to continue this As long as the crisis continues. the cash payments have to continue and the unemployment benefits and the offices need help in all the States getting up and running. Thank you. Hope that answers your question. It did. Thank you so much for answering my question and I appreciate the opportunity to actually be given the chance to speak to you. I’m glad you got You’re willing to speak with me and look, I know you’re worried about taking care of your son. I Know you’re worried about when the next meal is on the table and I know your work and a lot of people are all over the country. Thank you. By the way, you know what we’re realizing with all this crisis? How valuable, how valuable unions are, how valuable it is that we have an IBW, that we have people who in fact are first responders. How valuable the people we didn’t look to before and didn’t say, “Thank you,” for. This is this is going to workout for the best at the end because people now realize how valuable it is. If every electrician in America went on strike, America shuts down. Okay. You’re right. If every every janitor walks out, guess what? The disease in fact gets worse. We have to appreciate that people who are busting their neck, they’re the ones that built this country. They’re the ones that keep it going and I think there’s a new appreciation for just what’s being done by so many good people. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks for your question, Lovette. We have a question from some of our audience watching at home and Mr. It’s going to be very hard. Look, as I said, the President makes it sound like there’s a false choice. We either deal with the virus or we deal with unemployment and the economy. If you don’t deal with the virus first, you’re never going to get back to be able to have the kind of robust economy we need and get people taken care of. The first thing we have to do is make sure people are financially taken care of because their circumstances they’re in, whether they’re small businesses, they’re employees, whatever it is, is through no fault of their own. That’s a Government responsibility to keep them whole, as whole as we can do it and that’s got to come right out of the treasury and get paid for. Now on the issue of the virus, whoever asks, who has the question is this, it doesn’t matter, but whoever asked the question, you got it right. Until we have a vaccine, we’re not going to be totally out of the woods. In the meantime though, what we have to do is significantly increase, significantly increase the number of tests that are available, the testing kits that are available and all the protective gear that’s available so doctors and nurses can deal with this pandemic in a way where we don’t lose them, that they’re able to take care of our health. That’s why, again, going back to this Defense Production Act. I think the President should be taking over certain industries. We are going to do nothing but make another 30 million masks. You’re going to do nothing but make sure that the docs and nurses have the masks they need, that they have the gloves they need. You have nurses going into an operating room and into an ICU wearing garbage bags over them to try to protect. They need the protective gear, the goggles, the whole works, and so that should be priority number one. There is some real experimentation going on in terms of whether or not you can identify those people who have had the virus, didn’t know it and find out they’re immune knew it and they have an immune system that in fact would allow them to go back to work, even when the virus is not completely contained because they have an antibody. Those tests are now trying to be developed and they’re trying to develop tests where you can drive through and know in 5 to 15 minutes exactly whether you have the virus or not so we can trace people and determine who they’ve been in contact with or they had the virus. That has to be significantly, significantly, significantly increased and remember they were talking about they’re going to be doing 4 million tests today, about two weeks ago. Well, we’re not there yet because we have to indicate to whatever industry has the capacity to make this material, do these tests, put them together. They have to be done now as rapidly as possible and the prisoners should act. Thank you, Mr. Vice President. The next speaker for us right now is Ms. Judy Gile, who’s coming to us from Pennsylvania. Hi. Hi, Joe. Hey, Judy. I work for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. My job involves making sure that both workers and employers have a fair shot at the unemployment system through a timely hearing. As you spoke earlier, the unemployment system is overwhelmed and so many people are desperate for the money, so many people are just in fear. I got into public service to help people, to help my community. Well, first of all, Judy, what you’re doing, speaking up now not really mean it. It makes a big difference. Your Governor’s working like the devil to make sure that he’s able to have a staffed up unemployment office and he’s making sure that so many things is trying to get done. He shouldn’t have to compete with other States and the Federal Government to find out that they can’t get the material that they need to make themselves in the workplace, that they’re in a position where your colleagues are carrying the weight of the world on their backs. You’re the lifeline to people in moments of these kinds of moments when we’re fighting like hell to protect health, safety, families and I want to thank you for that. Look, there’s that’s always been true, but now there’s not a single person in this country who doesn’t know the heroic efforts so many people are making every single day and it’s past time we had your backs and here’s the deal. We’re in a position now where if in fact when you say, “What can we do?” We can make sure that the legislation that’s already been passed has the capacity to be distributed and there is, now, so far what we need essentially is the administration to have a place where you can go to one person, one place. How do we get the benefit, this benefit or that benefit? We start by getting immediate help to do your job in this trying time. Look. First, we need to make sure that you’re getting personal protective equipment, conditions that are needed for safety. I’ve called on President Trump, as I said, to employ that Defense Production Act, ensure every single front line worker has PPE and I’d also direct OSHA to deal with the state safety and health agencies to ensure that they have workplace policies. That’s there’s so many more to help. There’s so many more. Well, look, there’s a couple things. The Federal Government passed a lot of money for small businesses to keep them alive and well, to keep them going. The problem is it’s awful hard to figure how that small business gets that loan from the bank because the banks haven’t wanted … the big banks don’t like lending to small businesses. For example, Bank of America, which the American taxpayers bailed out last time around in a crisis. Well, they’re saying, unless you already have an account with us, unless you have a credit card with us, we’re not going to process a loan even though the Federal Government’s going to guarantee the loan that you have, guarantee you have it. So we should have an oversight on that to make sure the banks are held accountable, that they get out these small business loans. They are guaranteed by the Federal Government. We also should be doing things like making sure that the whole idea of the $500 billion for big companies wasn’t for them to be able to have stock buy backs or be able to move in a direction where they were able to reward their shareholders or their CEOs. It was to keep people employed on the payroll. And so we need to get the resources to the enforcers to know exactly what’s being done and what’s not being done. I urge the Federal Government to create an unemployment insurance delivery team with funding for extra staffing and server capacity to help States manage the crush of these claims. And in the Senate, Democrats have also opposed hazard pay for essential workers, a boost in paychecks that reflect the risk on a frontline workers are taking, I support extending any hazard pay congress provides the public sector workers in essential jobs. In order to make sure that they’re meaningful, we’ve got to get a lot more funding to the States. The States don’t have enough funding and they’re now pinched between plummeting tax revenues that they’re not collecting and soaring emergency response costs and to avoid painful damaging cuts in public services. So we can’t let the public sector workers risk losing pay. Instead, we have to encourage the privatization of the public sector as President Trump has done, that’s not what we should be doing. We need to boost support for state and local governments who are always and make sure that we’re going to have their backs and it means fighting, I would argue, for unions to make sure public sector employees have a voice in the workplace that they deserve. So there’s so much that the President … as President, I’ll pass the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act and make it a Federal right for all public sector employees to be able to organize and collectively bargain so someone who serves our communities has a voice on the job. My point is we have to give the States significantly more help. We have to have essentially a person in command who is able to distribute all that’s needed to these States, right, answering directly to the President of United States and I don’t think that’s being done now. I agree. He is. … but he is limited. He’s very limited and that’s why he shouldn’t have to compete with other States to figure out whether he can find protective gear for his first responders or his doctors or his nurses or the hospitals that are in trouble, et cetera. That’s a Federal responsibility. Thank you Judy. And as a state legislator, Mr. Vice President, it is very encouraging to hear that you acutely understand the needs that States across the Country will have, not only during this crisis, but following it. Our next question comes from an audience member and it’s a question that I think a lot of folks have on their minds. This audience member asks, I’ve just lost my job. Well, it’s going to take a while to get it back on track and it’s not going to get back on track until we get the virus under control. So social distancing is going to be required for some time, number one. Number two, that’s why it’s so urgent to do two things that could speed that up considerably. One, we should be working, as I think we are now, with the international community, not just our doctors and scientists, to find a vaccine. To find a vaccine. In the meantime, we also have the opportunity to do a great deal more in providing millions and millions of tests that you can get a result from those tests in five to seven minutes. So you know whether or not you’ve had the virus, but you’re well, you don’t have the virus, or you have the virus. That all sends you in different directions. If you’ve had the virus and you are well, it means you have an antibody in your system. They’re trying to develop how you can develop those antibodies that can be applicable to other people to prevent them from getting the disease, or allowing you to go back to work because you don’t have to social distance because you’re not a carrier, you’re immune, and as well as you’re not likely to get the disease from someone else. We also have to work really hard, really hard to make sure in the meantime, in the meantime, everybody is held harmless. This is not anybody’s fault. This is not anybody’s fault. It’s nothing they did for this to happen and so we have to do is provide for the ability for you to be able to stay in your home, get unemployment insurance, get a direct payment from the Federal Government so you can sustain yourself and your children in this period of real crisis. And it also means making sure that everybody understands in this next bill that gets passed that any costs relating to the coronavirus in terms of testing or healthcare is free. You don’t have to pay anything for it. Period. Thank you, Mr. Vice President. I really appreciate your ability to so succinctly and thoroughly summarize what needs to happen. We have one more guest with us this evening. Her name is Leah Dudley from Detroit and she’s … I’ll take a minute of personal pride to say that she’s my UNITE HERE sister. So Leah, the floor is yours. Hello, Mr. I’m good. I’m good. I just want to introduce myself. I’m a dedicated shop steward and a member of UNITE HERE, Local 24 in Detroit. I am a cashier at the MGM Detroit where I’ve been for the past 20 years. I am a single parent. I have a 16 year old daughter and I got laid off and there are people here in Detroit who are out of work. My benefits extend until June 30th, but for millions of Americans who were laid off in March they lost their health care as of April 1st. Three things. First of all, I think for those who are not union members and don’t have health insurance, that we should open up Obamacare and allow them to become part of Obamacare instead of being in court like the President is, trying to get rid of it. That’s number one. Laid off workers, you have fought and bargained, and those of you who are with UNITE HERE, you bargain hard for quality health insurance and you shouldn’t lose it, least of all now. And as I’m partially repeating myself, but the first thing I would do for all workers is make sure COVID-19 treatment is cost-free. Period. Whatever treatment is associated with it. No one should have to pay a dollar out of pocket for that. I called for that on March the 12th and it should be part of the next congressional package that hadn’t passed yet. The next thing I would do is help laid off union members, ensure they keep their union health insurance through COBRA, the COBRA program. When we went through the last crisis, economic crisis, Barack and I made sure that 65% of all the COBRA payments were paid for by the Federal Government. It’s a fancy way of saying COBRA allows you to keep your UNITE HERE insurance plan, even if your company can’t continue to provide it. And you probably know, but for the folks at home who may not, COBRA is a program where if you lose your job, you can pay to stay on your same insurance plan you had when you were working for the company you were working with. The problem is it’s really expensive. If you have to pay multiple times more for your existing premium for the same plan you had before you were laid off because your employer no longer is making contributions toward it, that premium is pretty high. So I believe the Federal Government should be the one offering the subsidies to you to cover most of all the CORBRA premium so that for example, in 2009, I’m repeating myself, our administration picked up 65% of the family cost to keep your existing insurance program under the COBRA program. Given the nature of this crisis, I’m calling on the Trump administration and Congress to pick up the full cost of the premiums right now. Congress should include this in this new phase four legislation. The bottom line means for all those union members who are worried about whether their employer will keep funding the health care plans, I would protect them. Union members have fought hard for their health insurance and I put forward back on March the 12th that I commit to ensuring that the Taft-Hartley benefit funds have the financial resources so that they can continue to keep those programs going in the company, the outfit you work for. And finally for all workers, in addition to the COBRA subsidies I’d provide enhanced subsidies to make sure that the Affordable Care Act priorities are more meaningful so that lower-income and middle class folks have less cost sharing and more affordable health care so that they don’t have to increase their premiums. Meanwhile, I’ve been calling on the Trump administration to stop fighting in the courts to try to gut the law and get rid of Obamacare. Now I realize they’re two different things. You’re not talking about Obamacare. You’re talking being able to keep your really well-funded, you’ve given up an awful lot and pay over the years to make sure you have a really good healthcare plan through your employer. Again, let’s get straight. I know this is complicated. The COBRA program says that that’s what it’s for. It allows you to keep your existing plan and will be paid for, the one you have through UNITE HERE, and the Federal Government will pay the 100% of that premium. You wouldn’t have to pay a thing. You continue to get the plan and it’s cost-free to you. The one you have now, no additional premium to you as long as this crisis lasts. Yes. Yeah. It’s okay if it hadn’t. I’ll try … it’s complicated, but in one sense it shouldn’t be complicated. You or the outfit you work for did nothing through their fault to cause that insurance to not be able to be funded. That’s why we set up the COBRA plan years ago to begin with. It’s 100%, but it has to be passed by the Congress and signed by the President this go round for the next tranche of money that’s going in to make sure people are kept whole. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Leah, and thank you for that thorough response. Mr. Probably too thorough. I apologize, but I think, look, as you and I’ve talked about this, Senator, I’m always talked about as being a foreign policy expert. Health care’s more complicated than foreign policy. Healthcare is complicated and it really is daunting for an awful lot of people, and so that’s why maybe I over explained. And that message is, it makes me feel better. And I’m hopeful that Congress takes action on your vision for what needs to happen, so that workers like Leah and Judy and [Lavette 00:42:17] are able to keep their health insurance. Well, by the way, Nancy Pelosi feels strongly about this. An awful lot of Democrats in the Congress are pushing it. It’s just going to be a little uphill fight with our Republican friends. Yeah. Well, and before I turn it over to you to close, I want to remind folks not only about how important this election is, but what we’ve seen today is demonstrative of the fact that you have the heart to put workers first, and that is the opposite of what the man in the White House is doing today. And that you have the experience to know what needs to happen and you have the leadership to actually get it done, and it’s why this election continues to be so important. And I’m so grateful that you have pushed hard to make sure that policies that protect workers in this moment, that drive our country forward, are at the forefront of discussion, and that your conviction in making sure that America moves forward out of this is what makes me so proud to support you and to know that you’ll be our next president. So we’ll turn the floor over to you before we close. Well, I’ll be very brief. Look, I know I’m occasionally called a congenital optimist, but I think I’m a student of history. Out of every real serious crisis the country’s faced, we’ve lost a lot, people have suffered a lot, but they’ve come through it, and we’ve ended up better for it. Out of the Great Depression, we ended up with everything from the Fair Labor Standards Act to Social Security, a whole range of things. We were better off for it. Ordinary people were better off. Now what people are seeing, they took for granted so many of the functions the people that you represent provide, so many things they do. They just took it for granted, and now they’re realizing that person stocking the shelf in the grocery store every day in the middle of this crisis is risking themselves. Jill, my wife Jill, who you know well, Jill did an event earlier today with what used to be called the Janitors’ Union. They’re beyond that now. They’re the people after everything that goes on in a crisis, everything that goes on that is being done, whether it’s a warehouse or an operating room, they go in and sanitize it, and they’re going in to sanitize it without all the equipment they need. They’re putting themselves at risk for it. People are understanding that the reason this country is who they are is because of ordinary people, like the folks I come from, and you come from, and most Americans do. They’re the ones that make it work, and they’re beginning to realize we owe them. We owe them a much better circumstance. Let me conclude with one other thing. This millennial generation, of which you’re a part, has gone through a hell of a circumstance over the last 15 years. They ended up in a situation where we had, because of the financial crisis and the previous administration before us, they ended up in a situation where they’re behind the eight ball. They in fact had to borrow enormous amounts of money to go to school. They had to put themselves in a position where they started off in debt, where they weren’t able to buy a home. They weren’t able to go out and buy a car because of the debt they inherited, because of what happened with everything from the [inaudible 00:45:48] anyway, because of viruses, because of the concern we had with the financial collapse. And a lot of them lost a lot in the meantime. In the meantime, now you have this so-called new generation, the Z generation, coming along, and they’re missing out on so much. I don’t think it has to be explained anymore. They’re not having their graduation parties. They’re not having their prom. They’re not having commencement. They’re having to give up an awful lot of things, an awful lot of things, and they’re being put further behind the eight ball. They’re going to start off at a slower pace in terms of jobs available to them. They’re going to start off in ways that they’re going to be behind the eight ball. That’s why we have to look at them now. They’re not whining. They’re just out there saying, hey, look, I busted my neck. That’s why the next bill should forgive a minimum of $10,000 of student debt for everybody with a debt when they pass this bill, just right off the bat, keep them in a position so when we come out of this, they’re not further in the hole, that they’re not so deep in the hole that they’ve been put into. The other thing is we have to take care of seniors better. We should be increasing Social Security payments now. They’re struggling. They’re having real problems now. We should be increasing Social Security payments across the board, $200 for everybody, besides reforming the system down the road to make it more applicable and more generous. There’s things we should be doing now, so when we come out of this, people aren’t in a deeper hole than they were to begin with. I have a lot more to say, but I’ve said too much. I get too passionate about it, but I promise you, Senator, we can get through this. As you’ve heard me say before, Wall Street didn’t build this country. Ordinary, hard working people built this country. Given half a chance, they have never, ever, ever, ever let their country down. Never once, never once. And that’s how we build the middle class. You built the middle class. Unions like yours built the middle class. That’s why we’re where we are. I think people are realizing it now, so I think we’re going to be in much better shape when we get through this to have the kind of structural change we need to make it better for everybody, because when the hard working person with a high school education, which is not you, you’re beyond that, but with a high school education, breaking their neck, all of a sudden people are saying, “I couldn’t make it without that person.” We’ve got to treat them better. They deserve a better wage. They deserve to be treated with decency. They deserve to be thanked. They’re the ones doing God’s work here. Cops, firefighters, and nurses and doctors, first responders. I mean, ambulance drivers. I mean, we just owe them so much and they deserve not just our thanks. They deserve that they should be paid what they deserve and treated with dignity. Anyway, thank you very much, Senator. I appreciate it. I’m looking forward to seeing you soon, I hope. Thank you. Thank you, and thanks to everyone for joining us."
"60","04-13-20"," We all have to know the clock is ticking. We don’t have a moment to waste in combating the climate crisis. It’s an existential threat to us. In short, we need to build a fair, more inclusive and more resilient America. And with that in mind, I’d like to welcome to this conversation a leader who shares those values and has been an outspoken advocate for that vision for a long time. My friend, Senator Bernie Sanders. Bernie, welcome. Joe, thank you very much for your remarks and thank you for welcoming me to your livestream here. As you’ve indicated, we are living in an unbelievably unprecedented moment. You and I were chatting a few months ago, not in a million years would we have believed that we would be talking to each other in our respective homes, that we could not do rallies, that we could not get out of the house. We would not have believed that we’d be looking not only at a pandemic, which as you indicated has taken over 20,000 lives in our country. Half a million people infected but has cost us 16 million jobs and that’s probably a conservative number. The real number is probably higher than that. So, we are in a terrible moment, an unprecedented moment. And I know we share the understanding that we’ve got to go forward right now and out of this in an unprecedented way to address the terrible pain that so many of our fellow Americans are feeling. So today I am asking all Americans, I’m asking every Democrat, I’m asking every independent, I’m asking a lot of Republicans to come together in this campaign to support your candidacy, which I endorse to make certain that we defeat somebody who I believe, and I’m just speaking just for myself now, is the most dangerous president in the modern history of this country. A president, and you made this point who downplayed this pandemic, who ignored the advice that some of his people were giving him, who has not used the Defense Production Act early on so that we could produce the masks, the gowns, the gloves, the ventilators that our medical personnel desperately need. Who today, because I understand that he is threatening to fire Dr. Fauci, who has been an unbelievable, I mean it is… Who has been day after day, the voice of science to the American people trying to explain how we go forward in this crisis and he’s threatening to fire him. So to me, for all of those reasons and so many more, a president who doesn’t apparently has never read the constitution of the United States who believes he’s above the law. A president who lies all of the time, a president who has at least shown me that he is a racist and a sexist and a homophobe and a xenophobe and a religious bigot. I mean, for all of those reasons or more, we’ve got to make Trump a one term president and we need you in the White House. So I will do all that I can to see that happens, Joe. And I know that there is an enormous responsibility on your shoulders right now and it’s imperative that all of us work together to do what has to be done not only in this moment but beyond this moment in the future of this country. And in that regard I have been very pleased that your staff and my staff have been working together over the last several weeks to coming up with a number of task forces. These are task forces that will look at some of the most important issues facing this country, the economy, how we create an economy that works for all, not just a few. Education, how we create the best educational system in the world for all of our people. How we deal with climate change, which as you indicated is an existential threat to the planet. How we deal with criminal justice because we don’t want to continue having more people in jail than any other country on earth. How we deal with immigration reform and how we have a healthcare system that is so much better than what we have right now. Now, it’s no great secret out there, Joe, that you and I have our differences and we’re not going to paper them over. That’s real. But I hope that these task forces will come together utilizing the best minds and people in your campaign and in my campaign to work out real solutions to these very, very important problems. So look forward to working with you and bringing some great people into those task forces. Well, Bernie I want to thank you for that. It’s a big deal. And I think that your endorsement means a great deal. It means a great deal to me. I think people are going to be surprised that we are apart on some issues, but we’re awfully close to on a whole bunch of others. And, and I think you’ve made… If I am the nominee, which looks like now you just made me, I’m going to need you not just to win the campaign but to govern. I did Joe. Just let’s talk about some of the areas that I think we are actually fairly close. There are some areas where we disagree, but somewhere we are fairly close. Let’s talk about the economy and above and beyond the crisis that we’re in right now, you know very well that millions of our people are working for starvation wages. And one of the fights that I’ve been waging for a number of years now is to raise that minimum wage to at least 15 bucks an hour. … to at least 15 bucks an hour. Bernie, I’m extremely supportive of that and I thank you for leading on it, I thank you for your endorsement, your support. But look, it means a great deal to me personally, as I said in my statement, when you suspended your campaign, I want to thank you for being the powerful voice and you’ve been the most powerful voice for a fair and more just America. It’s a voice like yours that refuses to allow us just to accept what is. You’ve refused to accept that we can’t change what’s wrong in our nation. You refused to accept that health and wellbeing of our fellow citizens and our planet is the responsibility of somebody else. It’s our responsibility [inaudible 00:10:41] and you don’t get enough credit, Bernie, for being the voice that forces us to take a hard look in the mirror and ask ourselves, “Have we done enough,” and we haven’t. One issue you’ve led in the past is making sure that every single solitary thing we can do to keep workers whole during this crisis is a part of it. It goes well beyond the $15 an hour, as I said, more than 16 million, and you’re right, it’s probably significantly more than 16 million Americans have lost their jobs because that’s a lagging indicator. And Congress has appropriated more than $2.2 trillion in this last round of so called CARES Act. And my concern is the Trump administration is going to continue to do what it’s always done and that is, it’s going to make sure the response in a way that the structural benefits go to the wealthy and the well-connected. And that’s been your cry for a long time, Bernie. Basically, they’re helping their friends. It isn’t about the legislation, the legislation’s been good, it’s about how it’s being implemented. The biggest, best connected firms are getting assistance as fast as they can ask for it. Oversight and few conditions from Treasury and the Fed had been sort of wiped away. We should be imposing much stricter conditions on these big firms. Tell them they only get the relief if they keep workers on their payroll, keep their jobs, make a commitment they won’t buy back their stock, pay out dividends, enrich their executives. In fact, Donald Trump and his team are trying to gut the whole oversight of the Corporate Loan Program now. Trump fired the Inspector General … I know you know this … who was put in place to police corporate corruption and what’s he trying to hide? Congress should demand answers and I know you will. Meanwhile, the little guy, the mom and pop shops, the men and women and minority owned businesses, they’re have the fewest resources to fall back on in this crisis and they’re facing obstacles and delays the threaten their very existence of their businesses. And but no one in Donald Trump’s White House or Treasury is taking the kind of bold action required to make sure that those without prior wealth, without prior wealth or prior connections get a priority. We should insist that the Trump White House and the Treasury Department move more aggressively to get those grants and loans to small businesses now when they really need it. And if the banks won’t do it, to go back to your point, they won’t process the loans for small business regardless of their size, then the Federal Government should use their wartime authority to compel them to do so because otherwise in six months we’re going to look back and see this crisis has only made inequity worse in America. And I’ve said it from the beginning of our conversation, we just can’t think about building back to the way things were before. That is not good enough. We need to build for a better future and that’s exactly what these task forces, your team in mine, have put together to focus on. Well, Joe, thanks for your answer to the previous question because you’re absolutely right and I want everybody to hear and understand what Joe always just said. Among many of the provisions we put it in there wasn’t my first priority by any means, $450 billion for large corporations. So a lot of money and what Trump now wants to do is to spend that money without telling us who gets it. Exactly. Can you believe that? I mean it is beyond comprehension and that issue of transparency, if you receive money from the Federal Government, I’m sorry, we are going to know who you are, we’re going to know the nature of the contract that was established, et cetera, et cetera. But we need, as you indicated, absolute transparency. The other thing Joe, I think we have to deal with right now is with so many folks unemployed and underemployed, we’ve got to make sure that the government comes up with a continued set up policies that protect those workers. And the pain all over the country is now horrific. You have seen, as I have, these lines of cars of people in the United States of America, of folks who have just lost their jobs, who have no food in the pantry, they are lining up to get food. So we’ve got to do everything that we can as rapidly as we can to make sure that nobody in America goes hungry, that nobody in America during this crisis, in my view, lacks healthcare, that nobody in America in this crisis is evicted from their homes, evicted from their apartments, loses their homes. There’s an enormous amount of work that has to be done to protect workers in this country, in this crisis right now. Yeah. All right. So I think you and I understand the problems. Other way. … in the richest country in the history of the world at starvation wages. Go ahead, Joe. You know, Bernie, you and I’ve always shared a profound conviction as long as we’ve both been in politics. This country wasn’t built by Wall Street. It wasn’t built by CEOs and hedge fund managers. It was built by workers. The great American middle class was built by American labor unions. Unions, and yes, unions, that’s the story of America. Ordinary people from the neighborhoods you and I grew up in doing extraordinary things given half a chance. Millions of people all across this nation who get up every day and go to work, raise their families, pay their taxes, volunteer in their communities and make this country work. We’re watching them, they’re the people making it work now. And people understand that being middle class isn’t a number, it’s a value set. It’s about being able to own your own home and not have to rent it, if that’s what you choose. It’s about being able to live in a neighborhood where you can send your kids to the park and they’re going to come home safely. Or being able to send your kids to a good high school or good school, public school, where they’ll do well enough that they can go on to trade school or college or community college, whatever suits them well. And it’s about being able to take care, take care of your geriatric mom when your dad passes, or about being able to put money aside so your kids won’t have to take care of you when you haven’t been able to save for retirement. And at the turn of the 20th Century, our labor movement built the middle class out of factory workers, and now two decades later, the 21st Century, our labor moment is trying to build that by including not just factory workers, but service workers too. Healthcare and home care workers, you’ve been fighting for them for a long time. Childcare workers, janitors, garbage truck drivers, grocery store clerks, fast food workers. In short, people on the front lines of this crisis. Here’s what I’m hoping, Bernie. I’m hoping that the American people are going to get a fresh look at really who makes the country run. I really mean it. We’re seeing the country restore … it’s the soul of America, we’re seeing a little bit of it. These people coming forward doing extraordinary things when they don’t have to. And I want Donald Trump to look at these people in the eye and tell them after they put their lives on the line for the rest of us, that they don’t deserve a living wage, that they don’t deserve healthcare, that they don’t deserve to be able to send their kids to college or community college or trade school, that they don’t deserve to make equal pay for equal work. I want him to look them in the eye and tell them that they don’t deserve to be able to organize, to fight for what they deserve, to bargain with dignity, to demand their employers give them their due. I want him to look them in the eye and tell them that the scientists are wrong, that climate change is not an existential crisis demanding worldwide domestic and international responses. And I want him to tell all the moms and dads across the country that their children and grandchildren don’t have the right to clean air and water. Look, the United States has no choice but to seize this opportunity and create millions, millions of great paying jobs that your Energy Plan has suggested and mine as well. An energy infrastructure of tomorrow, not going back to anything that was before. Tomorrow. And we take a back seat to no one when it comes to fighting climate change or when it comes to creating good paying jobs, middle-class jobs, union jobs. I led the Recovery Act, which was the single greatest investment in clean energy in American history. We could do more, we should do more. As President, I’ll put pipe fitters, iron workers, steel workers, electricians, and other trades to building the infrastructure over the clean energy future. Future. American workers should build American infrastructure and manufacturer all the materials that go into it, and all the workers must have an option to join a union. When they came up with the Fair Labor Standards Act, they didn’t say, “It’s okay to have a union.” It said, “We should encourage the formation of the unions.” When unions are doing well, everybody’s doing well. And Bernie, you and I have spent our careers fighting for these folks, and I look forward to working with you. And I’m going to need you badly because what leads me to another important issue in my view. Bernie, you have been maybe the most powerful voice for every generation of Americans, but I want to talk to you a moment about the people who are going to get hit the hardest by this crisis. And you and I both know it’s not folks who our age and just younger. It’s generation Z. People in their teens in their 20s. These are the people who are going to begin their careers, people working their way through college or trade school. They’re going to have student loans. They’re going to come into the economy, an economy in turmoil. We’re going to be worse than we are. The predictions are it’s going to be like Roosevelt, what he faced and worse. We saw it with the millennials after the 2008 crash. They’re still struggling to catch up. So what politics and what policies do we need to address for the concerns of these young people? Because I do think they’ve been put behind the eight ball more than our generation was or any generation in recent history. Oh, that’s absolutely true, Joe. And I’m glad you’re prepared to focus on that issue. It’s the right thing to do. And that is a generation of young people who are experiencing crisis after crisis. So let me start off by saying that in my view, if we believe in a strong democracy, which you do and I do. We have actually read the Constitution of the United States unlike the current president. If we understand that in a competitive global economy, we’re going to need the best educated workforce in the world. I think you understand and I understand that free public education has got to go beyond 12th grade right now, that we need to make public colleges and universities tuition free and that we have to move very aggressively. The dealing with the reality that so many of our people, young and not so young, are struggling with this outrageous level of student debt. I have outlined a program, Joe. Well look, Bernie, my deceased son, we’re still paying off his loan. We’re now paying it off. Now he went to a private university but still paying off his loan. My daughter is still paying off her loans and look, we need to think about what we can do to address these concerns. Look, you’ve been a leader on the student debt issue and affordability of higher education. I’ve been saying for a long time, you’ve probably heard me say in the past, one of the reasons why we jumped ahead and stay … One of the reasons why we jumped ahead of the rest of the world back in the turn of the 20th century, we were the first nation in the world to come along and say, “We have universal education for 12 years. I think not, but one of the things that I’ve changed my mind on, I propose to forgive debt for low income and middle-class individuals for community colleges and the like, but here’s the deal. If you’re attending a public university, college university, as well as a private HBCU historic black college or minority serving institutions, I’ve already called for immediate canceling of a minimum of $10,000 of their student loan debt now under this crisis and allow them to borrow so they can cope with this crisis. Look, I proposed and aggressively canceling student debt for those who were abused and misled by private for profit colleges. So have you. You’re way ahead. And those are folks with some of the highest debt burdens. As I’ve said earlier, as we deal with the immediate crisis response, we can’t lose sight of the longer term. When we come out of this, we can’t just go back to business as usual. We need to build a better, stronger foundation for America. Here’s my pledge. I will make an educator an education that in fact, Jill, my wife is a professor at a community college, says any country that out competes us, Joe, out educates is going to out compete us and so we’ll make education or community college free for all. And here’s the thing that has changed with this crisis. At our public colleges and universities make them free for all lower income and middle class families and middle class families. Because look, they’re going to face an enormous burden. Where are they going to get the money to go even to our state universities or borrow that money? We have to lower the cost of private historic black colleges universities, and minority serving institutions as well and ease the burden of student debt. And we’ll address the existential climate change as well. Look, in terms of student debt, anybody who is making less than $125,000 who in fact has a debt having gone to a community college in their family, I mean, assuming you’ve gone to a state university, they should be able to get debt forgiveness as well instead of in addition to just being able to go free to community college because they’ve been so badly banged since 2008. We got to build a green, resilient, sustainable infrastructure that will power generations of inclusive growth while saving our planet. Look, and we’re going to confront income and equity in this nation, build a social safety net that gives all Americans the dignity and security they deserve. And we’re going to make sure health care, and this is your signature issue, is made affordable and accessible to every American and build a public health system that can prevent future pandemics. I want to talk to you about this. I really think we should be thinking about having a new office, a new cabinet office, on pandemics in the United States, but that’s another issue. But we’re going to finally achieve comprehensive immigration reform as well putting millions of citizens on a pathway to citizenship, including so many who are on the front lines right now. The number of undocumented who are out there now risking their lives…risking their lives! One of the things I had the greatest pleasure of doing when I was vice president is going to one of Sadam Hussein’s, on of my multiple visits to Iraq, and swearing in well over, I think it was 180 undocumented people who were joined the United States military. They had won bronze stars, silver stars. They had purple hearts. These are people who have demonstrated, they’re prepared, they’re in a sense many are more Americans than a lot of Americans. We’re going to address this structural racism in our country as well. It’s going to take not just a criminal justice reform, but it’s also going to require the inequities that have led to this God awful situation in which African Americans, Latinos suffer at the hands of the coronavirus to a much greater extent than others. And look, I know we share the same goals with many of these things. What we’ve had different ideas how to accomplish them, but on some issues we’re going to continue to disagree respectfully but not on any substance of way. I believe there’s a great opportunity, a great opportunity to work together to deploy policy approaches that can take us closer to our shared goals. So I’m pleased to announce that Bernie and I have agreed to establish, as we said, we already talked about it, six policy working groups, one on the economy, one on education, one on criminal justice. It should be reform, not punishment. One on immigration, climate change and the economy. These groups are made up of thoughtful leaders that will work with Bernie and some of whom have supported me as well. And the task is for them to develop creative new ideas and proposals and we’re looking forward to turning that work into positive change for the country. So Bernie, I think it’s time we let these folk get going and I just want to say to you, I can’t tell you how much I appreciate all that you have done during all this time when people are surprised about, you and I have been friends. We’ve disagreed but we’ve been friends. We go all the way back to your first run and I appreciate your friendship and I promise you I will not let you down, but I understand you may have a closing statement to make Bernie or anything else. Anything you want to do. It doesn’t have to be closing, but anything at all. Well I thought we’d play some chess. I’d like to play chess. I’ve been playing on my cell phone. That’s about it. I got a beautiful chess board upstairs and I haven’t gotten anybody to play with. I see the one behind you. [crosstalk 00:29:41] everybody. Yeah, I got one right here. We’ll bore everybody for a few hours. Well, look, Joe, in all seriousness, in this terrible moment in our history and given the enormous challenges that we face in the future, but we don’t have a choice. They have to come together, bring the best minds, bring all of our people together to work our way out of this crisis. We are, and I’ve said this a million times, so let me say it a million and one. We’re the richest country in the history of the world. You know that? We should not have a half a million people who are homeless. We should not have half of our workers living paycheck to paycheck. We should not have more people in jail than any other country, disproportionately African American and Latino. You made the point about undocumented workers. The ugly irony is those people today in America are putting their lives on the line, and you know what? They’re not even eligible for the benefits that we have appropriated in the Senate. Imagine that. They can’t get that $1,200 check. They can’t get unemployment. So we got a lot of work to do to make this country the kind of nation that I know you want to see, that I want to see and the vast majority of the American people want to see. We got to deal with incoming wealth inequality. We’ve got to deal with a healthcare system that is broken in so many ways. You mentioned the issue of climate change. Man, we don’t have a choice there. Future of the planet determines, demands that we are bold in transforming our energy system. And as you’ve indicated, we can create millions of jobs doing that. So there’s a lot of work to do. Let’s go forward together in doing that. And I know you are the kind of guy who is going to be inclusive. You want to bring people in, even people who disagree with you. You want to hear what they have to say. We can argue it out. It’s called democracy. You believe in democracy. So do I. Let’s respect each other. Let’s address the challenges we face right now and in the future. And in that regard, Joe, I very much look forward to working with you. Well, Bernie, thank you. And look, one of the things that I think as a student of history, as you are, American history, out of every crisis Americans faced from the Civil War straight through to today, we have come out of it stronger. We’ve come out of it and fixed things that were institutionally, structurally wrong beforehand. We haven’t fixed them all. But look what happened with the Great Depression. We got everything from social security to right… a whole range of things. Well, this is a time, and I think what’s happened is the American public have seen, as I said earlier, I’ve said it may be a million times, I’m going to say a million and one, kind of rip the bandaid off, exposed how the substructure of this economy is so, so damaged by what’s going on. And the idea we’re still arguing about whether healthcare is a right is bizarre. The idea that we continue to think that the way to deal with the criminal justice system now that we’ve known so much and learned so much is to punish instead of rehabilitate. The idea we put someone in jail for a drug abuse, and we don’t put them in a mandatory rehabilitation as opposed to prison. The idea, we have people in prison who can’t read and don’t have any skill that we don’t train them so when they get out, you don’t give them a bus ticket and 25 bucks and put them underneath a bridge. But I’d like to close by saying, Bernie, as Jill and I told you and Jane, we’re deeply grateful to both of you. You’ve put the interest of this nation and the need to beat Donald Trump above all else. And for that, Jill and I are grateful. And we know we have enormous responsibility to meet that expectation. We also want you to know, I’m excited to do the work with you in the months and years ahead. As you say, not me, us. Not me, us. That’s your phrase, pal. And your supporters and I are going to make the same commitment. I see you. I tell your supporters, I see you. I hear you. I understand the urgency of what it is that we have to get done in this country. And I hope you’ll join us. The more, the merrier. We need to come together. We need to defeat Donald Trump. As I’ve said for a long time, when we do that, we’ll not only do the hard work of rebuilding this nation, we can transform this nation. We can transform it so that it goes down in history with your help, Bernie, as one of the most progressive administrations since Roosevelt. And I really believe, I think it’s doable because the whole world has changed. It’s not just us. The whole world has changed. We’re in the middle of a fourth industrial revolution. The question is, will there be a middle class left based on all that’s happening? We have to address it. It’s not just our concern. If we, the wealthiest country in the world, can’t address it and provide more equity and opportunity, we’re going to continue to see the kind of shifts you see in Europe. So anyway, I’m looking forward to working with you, pal. I really genuinely mean it from the bottom of my heart. Thank you for being such a gentlemen. Thank you for being so generous. And I give you my word. I’ll try my best not to let you all down. Thank you very much, Joe. Thanks, pal. Jane and I say hello to Jill as well. I will."
"61","04-13-21"," Capitol Hill police and all that are here to pay tribute to this Capitol Policemen who fell in the line of duty. Acting Chief Pittman and the men and women in the Capitol Police force, I’m sorry this is the second time in two months you have such a ceremony. And mom, I didn’t know Billy, but I knew Billy. I grew up with Billy in Claymont and Scranton, Pennsylvania. Billy was always the kid that if you got in a fight, you were outnumbered three to one, he’d still jump in, knowing you both get beaten. He was the one who always kept his word. If he said, he’d be there, he’d be there. He was the one who, just like folks I grew up with, wasn’t capable of saying no when you needed it. Just like you, Officer Kenny Shaver, who was injured in the attack with Billy, and never has there been more strain … And I’ve been here a long time. I’ve been here since 1972 as a US Senator in ’73. So much strain and responsibility have been placed on the shoulders of the Capitol Police. And yet, you hear it, you see it, you watch them, and you watch them do their duty with pure courage and not complain. Sergeant Kyle King, I’m sorry you had to make the call. That telephone call that every family dreads when they have a son or daughter, husband, wife, brother, sister in uniform. Because every morning they pin that badge on, go to work, they expect to come home, in the back of your minds, won’t ever get that call. You knew Billy since grade school. I think it was the fourth grade. I got to deal with all the guys that I grew up and knew in fourth grade. When one passes away, the other one has to give up, because he has too much information about you, too much they leave behind. But, I’m sure all those memories of North Adams and Clarksburg never changed who Billy was. He was defined by his dignity, his decency, his loyalty and his courage. And mom, that’s because of you and his dad. That’s how it happened. Not by accident. Ms. Evans, I have some idea of what you’re feeling like. I buried two of my children. And people have come up to you and are going to come up to you for some time and say, “I know how you feel.” They’re going to say that to sis. They’re going to say that to the kids. They’re going to say that to his former wife. And after a while, you know everybody means well. You feel like saying, “You have no idea.” But the truth is that a time’s going to come, I promise you. Not believable now. When a memory, a fragrance, a scene, a circumstance, the way his son tilts his head the way he did when he was that age, it’s going to bring back the memory. And for the longest time, it’s going to feel like, at that moment, that memory, is going to feel like you got the phone call just that moment ago. And they’re going to be people celebrating Billy’s life. And as much as you appreciate it, all of you, it also is hard. You relive everything again. I got a phone call when I first got here and lost my family, part of my family, from a person I never knew, never met, the former Governor of New Jersey who was literally 40, 45 years my senior. He told me he knew how I felt. And I didn’t say anything. He said, “I know what you’re thinking.” He said, “But I did know. He said, “I used to come home … I was the Attorney General of New Jersey before I was Governor. I’d come home for lunch because I lived just across the green from my office. And one day, a woman who helped out at our home came running across the green, saying, ‘She’s gone, she’s gone.'” His wife had had an aneurysm. He said, “You know what I did?” He said, “I kept … I got graph paper. And four months out, I put the month on it and in a horizontal line, I put the date, the month. In the vertical line, I put the numbers one to 10. 10 would be the happiest day of my life and one would be like that moment I got the phone call.” And he said, “And every night before I go to bed, I graph it. I put a dot on that day, where I was.” And he said, “Don’t look at it for three or four months.” He said, “You’ll look at it and you’ll see, put it on a graph.” He graphs it. “The downs are just as far down, but they get further and further and further apart. That you’re all going to know that you’re going to make it by holding each other together. Most importantly, by holding Logan and Abigail as tightly as you can. Because as long as you have them, you’ve got Billy. As long as you have them, my prayer for all of you is that a day will come when you have that memory. And I said, you smile before you bring a tear to your eyes. I promise you, it’s going to come. It just takes a while. It takes a while. But when it comes, you’ll know, because he’s still with you. He’s still in your heart. Losing a son, daughter, brother, sister, mom, dad, it’s like losing a piece of your soul. It’s buried deep, but it comes back. There’s a great quote by R.G. Ingersoll. It was read when my son, who was the Chief Law Enforcement Officer in the state of Delaware and the Attorney General came back from Iraq after a year and he died. And they read this poem from RG Ingersoll, who said, “When will defies fear, when duty throws the gauntlet down to fate, one honor scorns compromise with death, this is heroism. Your son, your husband, your brother, your dad was a hero and his [inaudible 00:09:19] is in your blood. My prayer for you is that moment of a smile comes before the tear, quicker, than longer. Thank you."
"62","04-14-21"," Good afternoon. I’m speaking to you today from the Roosevelt, the Treaty Room in the White House, the same spot where on October of 2001, President George W. Bush informed our nation the United States military had begun strikes on terrorist training camps in Afghanistan. It was just weeks, just weeks after the terrorist attack on our nation that killed 2,977 innocent souls, that turned lower Manhattan into a disaster area, destroyed parts of the Pentagon and made hallowed ground of a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, and sparked an American promise that we would never forget. We went to Afghanistan in 2001 to root out Al-Qaeda, to prevent future terrorist attacks against the United States planned from Afghanistan. Our objective was clear. The cause was just. Our NATO allies and partners rallied beside us. And I supported that military action along with an overwhelming majority of the members of Congress. More than seven years later in 2008, weeks before we swore the oath of office, President Obama and I were about to swear, President Obama asked me to travel to Afghanistan and report back on the state of the war in Afghanistan. I flew to Afghanistan to the Kunar Valley, a rugged mountainous region on the border with Pakistan. What I saw on that trip reinforced my conviction that only the Afghans have the right and responsibility to lead their country, and that more and endless American military force could not create or sustain a durable Afghan government. I believed that our presence in Afghanistan should be focused on the reason we went in the first place: To ensure Afghanistan would not be used as a base from which to attack our homeland again. We did that. We accomplished that objective. I said, among with others, we’d follow Osama Bin Laden to the gates of hell, if need be. That’s exactly what we did, and we got him. It took us close to 10 years to put president Obama’s commitment into form. And that’s exactly what happened. Osama Bin Ladin was gone. That was 10 years ago. Think about that. We delivered justice to Bin Laden a decade ago, and we’ve stayed in Afghanistan for a decade since. Since then, our reasons for remaining in Afghanistan have become increasingly unclear, even as the terrorist threat that we went to fight evolved. Over the past 20 years, the threat has become more dispersed, metastasizing around the globe. Al-Shabaab in Somalia, Al Qaeda in the Arabian peninsula, Al-Nusra in Syria, ISIS attempting to create a caliphate in Syria and Iraq and establishing affiliates in multiple countries in Africa and Asia. With the terror threat now in many places, keeping thousands of troops grounded and concentrated in just one country at a cost of billions each year makes little sense to me and to our leaders. We can not continue the cycle of extending or expanding our military presence in Afghanistan, hoping to create ideal conditions for the withdrawal and expecting a different result. I’m now the fourth United States president to preside over American true presence in Afghanistan; two Republicans, two Democrats. I will not pass this responsibility onto a fifth. After consulting closely with our allies and partners, with our military leaders and intelligence personnel, with our diplomats and our development experts, with the Congress and the vice president, as well as with Mr. Ghani and many others around the world. I concluded that as time to end America’s longest war. It’s time for American troops to come home. When I came to office, I inherited a diplomatic agreement, duly negotiated between the government of the United States and the Taliban, that all US forces would be out of Afghanistan by May 1, 2021, just three months after my inauguration. That’s what we inherited, that commitment. It is perhaps not what I would have negotiated myself, but it was an agreement made by the United States government; and that means something. In keeping with that agreement and with our national interest, the United States will begin our final withdrawal, begin it on May 1 of this year. We’ll not conduct a hasty rush to the exit. We’ll do it. We’ll do it responsibly, deliberately and safely. And we will do it in full coordination with our allies and partners who now have more forces in Afghanistan than we do. The Taliban should know that if they attack us as we draw down, we will defend ourselves and our partners with all the tools at our disposal. Our allies and partners have stood beside us shoulder to shoulder in Afghanistan for almost 20 years, and we’re deeply grateful for the contributions they have made to our shared mission and for the sacrifices they borne. The plan has long been: In together. Out together. US troops as well as forces deployed by our NATO allies and operational partners will be out of Afghanistan before we mark the 20th anniversary of that heinous attack on September 11th. But we’ll not take our eye off the terrorist threat. We’ll reorganize our counter-terrorism capabilities and the substantial assets in the region to prevent re-emergence of terrorists, the threat to our homeland from over the horizon. We’ll hold the Taliban accountable for its commitment not to allow any terrorists to threaten the United States or its allies from Afghan soil. The Afghan government has made that commitment to us as well. We’ll focus our full attention on the threat we face today. At my direction, my team is refining our national strategy to monitor and disrupt significant terrorist threats, not only in Afghanistan, but anywhere they may arise. And they’re in Africa, Europe, the Middle East and elsewhere. I spoke yesterday with President Bush to inform him of my decision. While he and I have had many disagreements over policy throughout the years, we’re absolutely united in our respect and support for the valor, courage and integrity of the women and men of the United States armed forces who served. I’m immensely grateful for the bravery and backbone that they have shown through nearly two decades of combat deployments. We as a nation have forever indebted to them and to their families. You all know that less than 1% of American serve in armed forces. The remaining 99%, we owe them. We owe them. They’ve never backed down from a single mission that we’ve asked of them. I’ve witnessed their bravery firsthand during my visits to Afghanistan. They’ve never wavered in their resolve. They’ve paid a tremendous price on our behalf, and they have the thanks of a grateful nation. While we’ll not stay involved in Afghanistan militarily, our diplomatic and humanitarian work will continue. We’ll continue to support the government of Afghanistan. We will keep providing assistance to the Afghan national defenses and security forces. Along with our partners, we have trained and equipped a standing force of over 300,000 Afghan personnel today and hundreds of thousands over the past two decades. They’ll continue to fight valiantly on behalf of the Afghans at great cost. They’ll support peace talks, as we will support peace talks between the government of Afghanistan and the Taliban, facilitated by the United Nations. And we’ll continue to support the rights of Afghan women and girls by maintaining significant humanitarian and development assistance. We’ll ask other countries, other countries in the region, to do more to support Afghanistan, especially Pakistan, as well as Russia, China, India, and Turkey. They all have a significant stake in a stable future for Afghanistan. Over the next few months, we’ll also determine what a continued US diplomatic presence in Afghanistan will look like, including how we’ll ensure the security of our diplomats. Look, I know there are many who will loudly insist that diplomacy cannot succeed without a robust US military presence to stand as leverage. We gave that argument a decade. It’s never proved effective, not when we had 98,000 troops in Afghanistan and not when we were down to a few thousand. Our diplomacy does not hinge on having boots in harm’s way, US boots on the ground. We have to change that thinking. American troops shouldn’t be used as a bargaining chip between warring parties in other countries. That’s nothing more than a recipe for keeping American troops in Afghanistan indefinitely. I also know there are many who’ll argue that we should stay, stay fighting in Afghanistan because withdrawal would damage America’s credibility and weaken America’s influence in the world. I believe the exact opposite is true. We went to Afghanistan because of a horrific attack that happened 20 years ago. That cannot explain why we should remain there in 2021. Rather than return to war the Taliban, we have to focus on the challenges that are in front of us. We have to track and disrupt terrorist networks and operations that spread far beyond Afghanistan since 9/11. We have to shore up American competitiveness to meet the stiff competition we’re facing from an increasingly assertive China. We have to strengthen our alliances and work with like-minded partners to ensure that the rules of international norms that govern cyber threats and emerging technologies that will shape our future are grounded in our democratic values, not those of the autocrats. We have to defeat this pandemic and strengthen the global health system to prepare for the next one, because there will be another pandemic. We’ll be much more formidable to our adversaries and competitors over the long term, if we fight the battles for the next 20 years, not the last 20. Finally, the main argument for staying longer, as each of my three predecessors have grappled with, no one wants to say that we should be in Afghanistan forever, but they insist now is not the right moment to leave. In 2014, NATO issued a declaration affirming that Afghan security forces would from that point on have full responsibility for the country’s security by the end of that year. That was seven years ago. So when will it be the right moment to leave? One more year? Two more years? 10 more years? 10, 20, $30 billion more on the trillion we’ve already spent? Not now? That’s how we got here. At this moment, there’s a significant downside risk to staying beyond May 1st without a clear timetable for departure. If we instead pursue the approach where America, US exit, is tied to conditions on the ground, we have to have clear answers to the following questions: Just what conditions would be required to allow us to depart? By what means and how long would it take to achieve them, if they could be achieved at all? And at what additional cost in lives and treasure? I’ve not heard any good answers to these questions. If you can’t answer them, in my view, we should not stay. The fact is that later today, I’m going to visit Arlington National Cemetery, Section 60, and that sacred memorial to American sacrifice. Section 60 is where our recent war dead are buried, including many of the women and men who died fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq. There is no comforting distance in history in section 60. The grief is raw. It’s a visceral reminder of the living cost of war. For the past 12 years, ever since I became vice-president, I’ve carried with me a card that reminds me of the exact number of American troops killed in Iraq and Afghanistan. That exact number, not an approximation or rounded off number because every one of those dead are sacred human beings who left behind entire families, an exact accounting of every single solitary one needs to be had. As of today, there are 2,488 US troops and personnel who’ve died in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Freedom’s Sentinel, our Afghanistan conflicts. 20,722 have been wounded. I’m the first president in 40 years who knows what it means to have a child serving in a war zone. Throughout this process, my North Star has been remembering what it was like when my late-son Beau was deployed to Iraq. How proud he was to serve his country. How insistent he was to deploy with his unit and the impact it had on him and all of us at home. We already have service members doing their duty in Afghanistan today whose parents served in the same war. We have service members who were not yet born when our nation was attacked on 9/11. War in Afghanistan was never meant to be a multi-generational undertaking. We were attacked. We went to war with clear goals. We achieved those objectives. Bin Ladin is dead and Al-Qaeda is degraded in Afghanistan. And it’s time to end the forever war. Thank you all for listening. May God protect our troops. May God bless all those families who lost someone in this endeavor."
"63","04-15-21"," Good afternoon, everyone. Earlier this week, I spoke with President Putin of Russia about the nature of our relationship, the relationship between our two countries. And I was candid, respectful. The conversation was candid and respectful. Two great powers with significant responsibility for global stability. And President Putin and I have had a significant responsibility to steward that relationship. I take that responsibility very seriously as I’m sure he does. Russia and Americans are both proud and patriotic people. And I believe the Russian people like the American people are invested in a peaceful and a secure future of our world. During the campaign for the presidency, I was on equivocal that if I was elected president I’d respond to any attempt to influence our elections, the last election. And because elections are sacred, they’re sovereign undertakings and are an expression of the will of the American people. And we can not allow a foreign power to interfere in our democratic process with impunity. And I told them if it turned out as I thought that there was engagement in our elections that I’d respond. Later during the transition as we learn more about the SolarWinds cyber intrusion, I made clear that I respond once we determined who had in fact conducted a hack on the scope and scale that occurred. When President Putin called me in January after I sworn in and to congratulate me, I told him that my administration would be looking very carefully now that we had access to all the data and at the issues to assess Russia’s role, and then determine what response we would make. When we spoke again this week, I told them that we would shortly be responding in a measured and a proportionate way because we concluded that they had interfered in the election and SolarWinds was totally inappropriate. Today and I’ve approved several steps, including expulsion of several Russian officials as a consequence of their actions. I’ve also signed an executive order authorizing new measures, including sanctions to address specific harmful actions that Russia has taken against US interest. I was clear with President Putin that we could have gone further, but I chose not to do so. I chose to be proportionate. The United States is not looking to kick off a cycle of escalation and conflict with Russia. We want a stable, predictable relationship. If Russia continues to interfere with our democracy, I’m prepared to take further actions to respond. It is my responsibility as President of the United States to do so. But throughout our long history of competition, our two countries have been able to find ways to manage tensions and to keep them from escalating out of control. There are also areas where Russia in the United States can and should work together. For example, in the earliest days of my administration, we were able to move quickly to extend for five years the New START Treaty and maintain that key element of nuclear stability between our nations. And that was in the interest of the United States of Russia, and quite frankly of the world. And we got it done. When I spoke to President Putin, I expressed my belief that communication between the two of us personally and directly was to be essential in moving forward to a more effective relationship, and he agreed on that point. To that end, I proposed that we meet in person this summer in Europe for a summit to address a range of issues facing both of our countries. Our teams are discussing that possibility right now. And out of that summit were to occur and I believe it will, the United States and Russia could launch a strategic stability dialogue to pursue cooperation and arms control and security. We can address critical global challenges that require Russia and the United States work together, including reining in nuclear threats from Iran and North Korea, ending this pandemic globally and meeting the existential crisis of climate change. I also made it clear to President Putin that the United States is unwavering in our support of our allies and partners in Europe. In that vein, I expressed concerned about Russia’s military buildup on Ukraine’s border and in occupied Crimea. I affirmed US support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine and I strongly urged him to refrain from any military action. Now is the time to deescalate. The way forward is through thoughtful dialogue and diplomatic process. The US is prepared to continue constructively to move forward that process. My bottom line is this. Where there’s an interest in the United States to work with Russia, we should and we will. Where Russia seeks to violate the interest of the United States, we will respond. We’ll always stand in defense of our country, our institutions, our people, and our allies. Thank you very much for your time. Mr. We indicated that we would talk about it. I laid out as I said, very simply I said during the campaign, I said when he called to congratulate me on being elected, I said subsequent to that, this last conversation that if it turned out that he was in activities that he had been accused of in cybersecurity and SolarWinds and interfering in our elections, that I would respond in kind. I urged him to respond appropriately, not to exceed it because we can move as well. My hope and expectation is we we’ll be able to work out a modus vivendi, but it’s important that we have direct talks and that we continue to be in contact with one another. Thank you. Why not Nord Stream? [inaudible 00:06:36] lower the sanctions on Nord Stream 2, Mr. Nord Stream 2 is a complicated issue affecting our allies in Europe. I’ve been opposed to Nord Stream 2 for a long time from the beginning even when I was out of office and even before office, before I left office as vice president. But that’s still is an issue that is in play. Thank you very much."
"64","04-20-21"," … information that they request from us. It’s a tragic day in the city of Columbus. Horrible, heartbreaking situation. Not just the mayor, [inaudible 00:00:43]. The city of Columbus lost a 15 year old girl. We know, based on this footage, the officer took action to protect another young girl in our community. There’s a family screaming tonight. And this young 15 year old girl will never be coming home. We think it’s critically important to share as much information as possible as quickly as possible. So we’ll continue to share footage, other information in the hours and days ahead, making sure we’re not in any way, shape or form compromising the independent investigation being done by BCI. We felt transparency and sharing this footage, as incomplete as it may be at this time, is critically important to make sure that we were sharing good, accurate information about what transpired today with the public and for this grieving family. I ask for everyone to pray for peace, and if there’s anyone out there that has information about what took place today, to share that information to the appropriate authorities. But tonight, we pray for this family, we pray for our city and we pray for our neighbors throughout this community. [inaudible 00:03:06]. Thank you, Mayor Ginther. The death of a 15 year old child is devastating. She could be my grandchild. My heart breaks for the family tonight. No matter what the circumstances, that family is in agony and they are in my prayers. They deserve answers. Our city deserves answers. I want answers. But fast, quick answers cannot come at the cost of accurate answers. BCI will conduct a fully independent investigation, which will be made public. If an officer has violated policy or the law, if they have, it will be held accountable. It is my job as the safety director to, as much as possible, ensure that. But in any way that you look at this, this has been a tragedy, the death of a 15 year old child. So our thoughts and prayers are with the family. And we ask that everyone allow the process to work peacefully. Thank you. Again, I can take a few courses, but again, it will be difficult to answer a lot of things in detail, again, because our job at this point is to facilitate information to BCI and not conduct any part of the investigation. It was a disturbance call and the information was that a person called in and indicated that someone was trying to stab them and put their hands on them. The 911 call will reveal that there was a large commotion going on in the background and the dispatchers are trying to obtain as much information as they could, but weren’t successful in gathering a lot of information. That’ll have to be a BCI question and through their investigation. This officer will be taken off the street. Decisions about policy will come with conclusion of the criminal investigation. That is the standard policy of the division that we allow that criminal investigation to take place. Once that’s concluded, this case will go to the Franklin County Grand Jury to the prosecutor’s office. After that, we will review it for policy compliance or violations. I do not have any information about injuries to any other victims at the scene. We are not going to release that information yet. Again, I’ll need an opportunity to get that officer’s statement. Before that’s provided to us, that is provided to BCI. So we want to provide them the opportunity to speak to him first. We do not interview the officer. We allow BCI to take care of that. Once that’s done, we’ll review that statement and any other information that they get. We know one of the major reforms recently has been Andre’s Law. Yeah. Medics were called right away. Officers, you can see from the video, the one officer is assessing the young lady for injuries, and then CPR was started. Once we are able to release that full public record to you, you’ll see some additional lifesaving measures that were taken by at least two officers that were at scene. Again, I don’t want to make a speculation off of a video. There’ll be forensics done and could be done by BCI. And I would like them to answer that question. Deadly force can be used to protect yourself or the protection of a third person. So that is within the policy and that was within the law. That is what the law says. Whether this complies with that will be part of that investigation. I’m curious what you might say to folks who are outside. We saw people start to gather at 7:30 and it was a lot of emotion for a lot of folks. What I would say is we took some unprecedented steps tonight. I think that all of you would agree that we’ve never been able to release video this fast, but we thought it was important to share with the community, to be transparent about this incident, to let them have some answers that we can provide tonight. We know we can’t provide every answer, but it’s important that we can answer some questions tonight. And we wanted to get that out as soon as possible. We immediately spoke with Mayor Ginther and Director Pettus, and we decided this was the best way to get this information out as quickly as possible. In the interest of transparency, because there are people watching who may not have heard some of our interactions off camera, can you explain what people were seeing? Was any of that edited? I know some of the faces were blurred. Right. So public records law requires us to learn the face of any juvenile that may be in a video. So we were extra cautious and blurred the faces on the video tonight, but that was not edited. We did not show you the full video because we’ve not been able to complete that public records process. That’s a law that is incumbent and requires us to take away information before it’s released to the public. So the only editing that was done, it was that it was shorter than the full length of a video. But again, once that full public records process is completed, you will get that tomorrow. Thank you guys. Thank you. Thank you."
"65","04-21-21"," [inaudible 00:00:00], everyone. Back in December, I set a goal of administrating 100 million shots, vaccine shots in my first 100 days in office. At the time, some told us that couldn’t be done, it was awfully ambitious, but we did it in 58 days because of the incredible staff I have. And so I set a second goal to deliver 200 million shots in my first 100 days in office, a goal unmatched in the world or in prior mass vaccination efforts in American history. When tomorrow’s vaccine and vaccination numbers come out, it will show that today, we did it. Today, we hit 200 million shots in the 92nd day in office. 200 million shots in a hundred days, in under a hundred days actually. It’s an incredible achievement for the nation and here’s the context. You know, at the pace we were moving when I took office, it would have taken us more than 220 days, almost seven months, seven and a half months to reach 200 million shots. Instead of marking this a milestone in April, we would not have seen it until early September at the earliest. Some experts say that the rapid vaccination effort has already saved tens of thousands of American lives. We’ll never know exactly, but we know it saved lives that would have otherwise been lost. I’m proud of the work my administration has done to get Americans vaccine, but more than that, I’m proud of the American people, the volunteers who showed up to staff vaccination sites in their neighborhoods, drove senior citizens to get their shots, FEMA, the military, the National Guard, state and local health departments and providers running sites safely and efficiently, retired healthcare workers coming back to give life-saving shots to people in their communities. This is an American achievement, a powerful demonstration of unity and resolve, what unity will do for us, and a reminder of what we’re going to accomplish when we pull together as one people to a common goal. Now that we’ve reached this milestone, we’re entering a new phase of our vaccination effort. As of Monday, at my direction, with the support of 50 governors, Democrats and Republicans alike, everyone over the age of 16 will be eligible to get vaccinated. The first three months of our vaccination program focused on targeting vaccines to specific high-risk groups. Now our objective is to reach everyone, everyone over the age of 16 in America. Wherever you live, whatever circumstances, if you are 16 or older, you are now eligible for a free COVID vaccine shot and we have the vaccine to deliver. We head into this next phase, it’s important for us to look at where we stand. After three months of targeting vaccinations largely to healthcare workers, frontline workers, and people with high risk conditions, nursing homes, nursing home residents and seniors, the progress we’ve made has been stunning. Let me point out a few achievements. First, as of this past Sunday, more than 50% of adult Americans have had at least one vaccine shot. We still have a long way to go, but that’s an important marker of progress. When it comes to our target groups, the largest groups we focused on in these past 92 days have been seniors, Americans aged 65 and older that account for 80% of all the COVID deaths before we started vaccinating. When I took office, 8% of the people over 65 had received their first shot. I’m pleased to announce that by tomorrow, that total will exceed 80% of the people over the age of 65. 80% of American seniors of all races, religions, political views will have had at least one shot. It’ll be another month or so before we see the full benefits of this effort as many seniors still need the second shot, plus the two weeks to gain that protection after the second shot, but already we’ve seen a dramatic decline in deaths among people over the age of 65, an 80% reduction in deaths in people over the age of 65. Still, far too many lives lost, but also a lot of lives saved. In the weeks ahead, as more seniors reach full vaccination, that number of lives loss will continue to decrease. We’ve made great progress with another target group as well, educators, school staff, bus drivers, and childcare workers. Back in February when many of our schools were fully or partially closed, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the CDC, issued guidelines to help reopen our schools safely. Then in March, Congress approved the American Rescue Plan to fund the safe reopening of our schools. One thing was clear, many educators were understandably anxious about going back to a classroom without being vaccinated, and many parents were understandably nervous about sending their kids back as well. So on March the 2nd, I launched a program directing all states to make educators, school staff, school bus drivers, childcare workers eligible for vaccination in every state so the schools and childcare centers could open with a peace of mind. Within a month, 80% had received at least one shot, and school and childcare centers all over the country are reopening. Now to be clear, we still have some work to do with our target groups, but we’ve made remarkable progress. And as we continue, as I said, the time is now to open up a new phase of this historic vaccination effort. To put it simply, if you’ve been waiting for your turn, wait no longer. Now is the time for everyone over 16 years of age to get vaccinated. Unlike the target groups where we’ve made such great progress, the broad swath of American adults still remain largely unvaccinated. In a number of states, they weren’t eligible for the vaccination until this week. Too many younger Americans may still think they don’t need to get vaccinated. So let me explain two reasons why we need everyone over 16 years years of age in America to get vaccinated and share what we’re going to do to encourage it. The first reason quite simply is to keep you from getting very sick or dying. Hundreds of Americans are still dying from COVID every day. The data could not be clearer at this point. If you are fully vaccinated, two weeks beyond your last shot, you are nearly 100% protected against death from COVID. No matter what your age, no matter what your health history, until you are fully vaccinated you were still vulnerable. The vaccine can save your life. The second reason to get vaccinated is to protect your community, your family, your friends, and your neighbors. Vaccines can save your own life, but they can also save your grandmother’s life, your coworker’s life, the grocery store clerk, or the delivery person helping you and your neighbors get through the crisis. Now, that’s why you should get vaccinated. Let me talk about how we’re making it easier for you to be able to get vaccinated. First, there are some steps I announced previously that are hitting the ground this week. 90% of the American people now live within five miles of a place where they can get a shot. And under our federal vaccination program, shots will be available at nearly 40,000 pharmacies coast to coast. And if you can go in to buy your shampoo or toothpaste, you can stop and get vaccinated. The vaccine is free, it’s convenient, and it’s increasingly available. But I know that isn’t enough. As we move into the vaccination campaign focused on working age adults, one concern I’ve heard from so many Americans is that they can’t afford to take the time off to get vaccinated or lose a day’s work because they are feelings slightly under the weather after their shot. So today, I’m announcing a program to address that issue nationwide. I’m calling on every employer, large and small, in every state, to give employees the time off they need with pay to get vaccinated and any time they need with pay to recover if they’re feeling under the weather after the shot. No working American should lose a single dollar from their paycheck because they chose to fulfill their patriotic duty of getting vaccinated. We’re already seeing employers large and small stepping up to meet this historic moment. The grocery store Kroger’s offered employees $100 to get vaccinated. It helped push the vaccination rates from 50% to 75% among their associates. Patty Young owns a hair salon in Springfield, Ohio. She’s also dedicated to getting her customers and employees vaccinated, that when they leave the saloon, the receptionist… The saloon? The salon. They may be going to a saloon, I don’t know, but when they leave the salon, the receptionist helps sign you or your family up to get a COVID vaccine and where to get it. They’ve scheduled more than 200 shots so far. Business and employers like Patty should be supported for doing the right thing. So to make sure this policy comes at no cost to small or medium-sized businesses with fewer than 500 employees, the IRS has posted instructions for how employers can get reimbursed for the costs of providing paid leave for their employees to get vaccinated and recover from the side effects if they have any. That reimbursement, which comes through a tax payment, is thanks to the program I launched in the American Rescue Plan. So again, every employee should get paid leave to get a shot and businesses should know that they can provide it without a hit to their bottom line. So there’s no excuse for not getting it done. In the weeks ahead, I’ll have more to say about other new developments in our vaccine program. We’ll also continue moving aggressively to build on our progress and race to the finish line here. But let me close with this. Back on March 11th, I outlined a vision of what America could look like by the 4th of July, an America that was much closer to normal life that we left behind more than a year ago. We remain on track for that goal. In the weeks since then, more than 120 million shots have been given since I announced the July 4th proposal. More of our kids are back in school. And after a long and painful year, more grandparents are able to hug their grandkids again. It’s great progress. But if we let up now and stop being vigilant, this virus will erase the progress we’ve already achieved, the sacrifices we’ve made, the lives that have been put on hold, the loved ones who’ve been taken from us, the time we’re never going to get back. To celebrate our independence from this virus on July 4th with family and friends in small groups, we still have more to do in the months of May and June. We all need to mask up until the number of cases goes down, until everyone has a chance to get their shot. To American 16 years and older, it’s your turn now. Now. So go get your vaccine for before the end of May. We can do this, and we’ll do this as long as we don’t let up. Thank you all very much. As I said a long time ago, we’re going to beat this as long as we do it together. And I want to again thank my COVID team. I want to thank the Vice President. I want to thank Jeff Zients behind me and the entire COVID team for putting this together. May God protect our troops, may God bless you all. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Not yet, and you asked about what about abroad, helping abroad? We’re in the process of doing that. We’ve done a little bit of that already. We’re looking at what is going to be done with some of the vaccines that we are not using. We got to make sure they are safe to be sent. And we hope to be able to be of some help and value to countries around the world. I’ve talked to our neighbors. A matter of fact, a fellow who’s working really hard to take care of his country and deal with this, I was on the phone with for about half an hour today, the Prime Minister of Canada. We helped a little bit there. We’re going to try to help some more, but there’s other countries as well that I’m confident we can help, including in Central America. But it’s in process. We don’t have enough to be confident to send it abroad now, but I expect we’re going to be able to do that. Thank you."
"66","04-22-21"," Your excellencies, distinguished leaders, and esteemed colleagues from around the world, welcome to this historic Leaders Summit on Climate. I want to thank you for being here, and for your leadership. I have spoken with a number of you about the climate crisis. We have talked about the scarcity of water, we have talked about the need to build resilience, and we have talked about the importance of investing in clean technologies. Together, of course, we come from very different places, but we share this common concern and this common threat. Here in the United States, the storms hitting our Gulf Coast are worse every year. The wildfires in my home state of California have grown in intensity. And of course, no nation or region is immune. Whether it is Western Europe, where heatwaves have made it very difficult to stay indoors while risking a health risk, or the Pacific Islands, where rising sea levels threaten to encroach on the land and homes of lifelong residents, or in Central America, where last year, two major hurricanes devastated entire communities. As a global community, it is imperative that we act quickly and together to confront this crisis, and this will require innovation and collaboration around the world. It will require the use of renewable energy and new technologies, and it will give each of our nations the opportunity to build healthier communities and stronger economies. Here, we believe tackling climate change, improving communities, and creating jobs can occur simultaneously, and we must recognize the importance of course, of justice, in the work that we do. The communities hardest hit by climate change are the same communities harmed by wealth and gender inequality, toxic air pollution, and so much more. This truth holds around the world. So I urge all of us to focus on these communities, including Indigenous communities, and consider their insight and experience in our efforts moving forward. They are critical leaders in this fight. Friends, the health of our communities, the well-being of our workers, and the strength of our economies depend on what we do now, and I can think of no one more committed to achieving our collective goals, than President Joe Biden. The president was one of the first members in the United States Congress to take the issue of climate change, and on our first day in office, he led the fact that we would rejoin the Paris Agreement. And the president is just getting started, as we work to tackle this crisis, while creating clean energy jobs across our nation. It is now my great honor to introduce the President of the United States, Joe Biden. Thank you, Madam Vice-President. Good morning to all our colleagues around the world, the world leaders for taking part in this summit, I thank you. Your leadership on this issue is a statement to the people of your nation and to the people of every nation, especially our young people that we’re ready to meet this moment, and meeting this moment is about more than preserving our planet, it’s also about providing a better future for all of us. That’s why when people talk about climate, I think jobs. Within our climate response lies an extraordinary engine of job creation and economic opportunity, ready to be fired up. That’s why I’ve proposed a huge investment in American infrastructure and American innovation to tap the economic opportunity that climate change presents to our workers and our communities, especially those too often that I’ve left out and left behind. I’d like to build, I want to build a critical infrastructure to produce and deploy clean technology, both those we can harness today, and those that we’ll invent tomorrow. I talked to the experts, and I see the potential for a more prosperous and equitable future. The signs are unmistakable, the science is undeniable, and the cost of inaction keeps mounting. The United States is in waiting. We are resolving to take action, not only our federal government, but our cities and our states all across our country, small businesses, large businesses, large corporations, American workers in every field. I see an opportunity to create millions of good paying middle-class union jobs. I see lineworkers laying thousands of miles of transmission lines for a clean, modern, resilient grid. I see workers capping hundreds of thousands of abandoned oil and gas wells that need to be cleaned up, and abandoned coal mines that need to be reclaimed, putting a stop to the methane leaks, and protecting the health of our communities. I see auto workers building the next generation of electric vehicles, and electricians installing nationwide for 500,000 charging stations along our highways. I see the engineers and the construction workers building new carbon capture and green hydrogen plants to forge cleaner steel and cement, and produce clean power. I see farmers deploying cutting edge tools to make soil of our heartland, the next frontier in carbon innovation. By maintaining those investments and putting these people to work, the United States sets out on the road to cut greenhouse gases in half, in half by the end of this decade. That’s where we’re headed as a nation, and that’s what we can do, if we take action to build an economy that’s not only more prosperous, but healthier, fairer, and cleaner for the entire planet. These steps will set on America on a path of net zero emissions economy by no later than 2050. But the truth is, America represents less than 15% of the world’s emissions. No nation can solve this crisis on our own, as I know you all fully understand. All of us, all of us, and particularly those of us who represent the world’s largest economies. We have to step up. Those that do take action and make bold investments in their people, and clean energy future, will win the good jobs of tomorrow and make their economies more resilient and more competitive. So let’s run that race. Win more, win more sustainable future than we have now. Overcome the existential crisis of our times. We know just how critically important that is, because scientists tell us that this is the decisive decade. This is the decade we must make decisions that will avoid the worst consequences of the climate crisis. We must try to keep the Earth’s temperature to an increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius. The world beyond 1.5 degrees means more frequent and intense fires, floods, droughts, heatwaves, and hurricanes, tearing through communities, ripping away lives and livelihoods, increasingly dire impacts to our public health. It’s undeniable, [inaudible 00:08:08], the idea of accelerating and punishing the reality that will come, if we don’t move. We can’t resign ourselves to that future. We have to take action, all of us, and this summit is our first step on the road we’ll travel together, God willing all of us, to, and through Glasgow this November in the UN Climate Change Conference. To set our world on a path to a secure, prosperous, and sustainable future, the health of communities throughout the world depends on it. The well-being of our workers depends on it. The strength of our economies depends on it. The countries that take decisive action now to create the industries of the future, will be the ones that reap the economic benefits of the clean energy boom that’s coming. We’re here at this summit to discuss how each of us, each country, can set higher climate ambitions that will in turn, create good paying jobs, advance innovative technologies, and help vulnerable countries adapt to climate impacts. We have to move. We have to move quickly to meet these challenges. The steps our countries take between now and Glasgow will set the world up for success to protect livelihoods around the world, and keep global warming at a maximum of 1.5 degrees Celsius. We must get on the path now in order to do that. If we do, we’ll breathe easier, literally and figuratively. We’ll create good jobs here at home for millions of Americans, and lay a strong foundation for growth for the future, and that can be your goal as well. This is a moral imperative, an economic imperative, a moment of peril, but also a moment of extraordinary possibilities. Time is short, but I believe we can do this, and I believe that we will do this. Thank you for being part of the summit. Thank you for the communities and the commitments you have made, and the communities you’re from. God bless you all, and I look forward to progress that we can make together today and beyond. We really have no choice. We have to get this done."
"67","04-23-21"," All the world leaders who’ve joined us, thank you for joining, and John, thank you for putting this together. We’ve made great progress, in my view, so far, and I’m grateful to all the leaders who’ve announced new commitments to help us meet the existential threat of climate change. This summit is a start, a start of a road that will take us to Glasgow for the UN Climate Change Conference in November, where we’re going to make these commitments real, putting all of our nations on a path to a secure, prosperous, and sustainable future. Today’s final session is not about the threat of climate change poses. It’s about the opportunity that addressing climate change provides. It’s an opportunity to create millions of good-paying jobs around the world in innovative sectors, jobs that bring greater quality of life, greater dignity to the people who are performing those jobs in every nation. For a line worker, electricians, utility workers, line, transmission lines, connecting battery storage, and making our electric grid more modern. For automotive workers, building electric cars, trucks, and buses. Skilled workers installing charging stations to accommodate them throughout our countries. Construction workers, engineers, insulators upgrading our schools and commercial buildings and constructing new energy-efficient homes. Manufacturing. Manufacturing workers building nuclear and carbon capture technologies, solar panels, and wind turbines. And people working in the fields that we haven’t even conceived of yet, on farms and on factories and in laboratories and universities, the things we haven’t even thought of so far. This challenge and these opportunities are going to be met by working people in every nation, and as we transition to a clean energy future, we must ensure that workers who have thrived in yesterday’s and today’s industries have as bright a tomorrow in the new industries, as well as in the places where they live, in the communities they have built. When we invest in climate resilience and infrastructure, we create opportunities for everyone. That’s the heart of my jobs plan that I proposed here in the United States. It’s how our nation intends to build an economy that gives everybody a fair shot. As you heard in the last session, it requires investing in innovation. That’s why I’ve asked the Secretary of Energy, my energy secretary, Jennifer Granholm, who you saw earlier, to speed the development of critical technologies to tackle the climate crisis. No single technology is the answer on its own because every sector requires innovation to meet this moment. This critical effort is going to propel the most impactful breakthroughs at home and around the world and lower the cost of what we’re paying now for polluting the air so badly. We’re going to move to net zero in a transition in all countries. And look, every country will need to invest in new clean energy technologies as we work forward and to deal with net zero emissions. I am also very proud to announce the United States is again becoming a key leader in Mission Innovation. We helped launch the program during the Obama-Biden administration, a pact between the world’s largest economies to ramp up investments in clean energy research and development. And today, America is once again stepping into the leadership role. We will be joining in a partner for the nations and efforts to decarbonize critical sectors across the board, including industrial sector, where we’ll join with Sweden and India in the leadership group for industry transition; the power sector, where we’ll work alongside of the United Kingdom to spread progress and speed it up toward a carbon-free power system, both here and around the world; and an agriculture, the agricultural sector, where we’ll launch the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate with the United United Arab Emirates and other partners. We also, I’m very heartened by President Putin’s call yesterday for the world to collaborate and advance carbon dioxide removal, and the United States looks forward to working with Russia and other countries in that endeavor. It has a great promise. This is a moment for all of us to build better economies for our children and our grandchildren and all of us to thrive, to thrive in not just now, but beyond, for the next generations. Nations that work together to invest in a cleaner economy will reap rewards for their citizens. The United States is committed. We are committed to making those investments to grow our economy here at home while connecting with markets around the world. For example, we’re launching a new global partnership for climate smart infrastructure. This will create good-paying jobs here in America by supporting development of new clean infrastructure in our partner countries. These are the sort of partnerships that are going to be good for all of us, and I think they’ll have additional benefits just us working together. And today, I’m excited to welcome my counterparts in Spain, Nigeria, Vietnam, and Poland to share their thinking on how to realize the economic opportunities of the climate response. And we’re going to be joined by labor and business community leaders from around the world to talk about what’s happening in their communities around climate-related jobs. And I’m pleased to be joined by Secretary Buttigieg, Ambassador Tai, and National Climate Adviser Gina McCarthy, the chair of my national climate task force. I look forward to our conversation and making more progress throughout the day. Thank you."
"68","04-28-21"," Waited a long time to do this. [inaudible 00:12:23] Thanks for having me. Okay. Members of Congress, I have the high privilege and distinct honor to present to you the President of the United States. Can’t get the mask off that easy. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. [inaudible 00:13:09] and Chuck will understand it’s good to be almost home, down the hall. Anyway, thank you all. Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President. No President has ever said those words from this podium. No President has ever said those words, and it’s about time. First Lady, I’m her husband. Second Gentleman. Chief Justice. Members of the United States Congress and the cabinet, distinguished guests, my fellow Americans. While the setting tonight is familiar. This gathering is just a little bit different. A reminder of the extraordinary times we’re in. Throughout our history, presidents have come to this chamber to speak to Congress, to the Nation and to the world. To declare war, to celebrate peace, to announce new plans and possibilities. Tonight, I come to talk about crisis and opportunity. About rebuilding a nation, revitalizing our democracy and winning the future for America. I stand here tonight, one day shy of the 100th day of my administration. A hundred days since I took the oath of office and lifted my hand off our family Bible and inherited a nation, we all did, that was in crisis. The worst pandemic in the century, the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War. Now after just 100 days, I can report to the nation, America is on the move again. Turning peril into possibility, crisis to opportunity, setbacks into strength. We all know life can knock us down, but in America we never ever, ever stay down. Americans always get up. Today, that’s what we’re doing. America’s rising anew, choosing hope over fear, truth over lies and light over darkness. After 100 days of rescue and renewal, America’s ready for a takeoff in my view. We’re working again, dreaming again, discovering again, and leading the world again. We have shown each other and the world that there’s no Quit in America. None. One hundred days ago, America’s house was on fire and we had to act. Thanks to the extraordinary leadership of Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader Schumer, and the overwhelming support of the American people, Democrats, Independents, and Republicans, we did act. Together we passed the American Rescue Plan. One of the most consequential rescue packages in American history. We’re already seeing the results. We’re already seeing the results. After I promised we’d get 100 million COVID-19 vaccine shots into people’s arms in 100 days, we will have provided over 220 million COVID shots in those 100 days. Thanks to all the help of all of you. With your help, everyone’s help we’re marshaling every federal resource. We’ve gotten vaccines in nearly 40,000 pharmacies and over 700 community health centers where the poorest of the poor can be reached. We’re setting up community vaccination sites, developing mobile units to get to hard-to-reach communities. Today, 90% of Americans now live within five miles of a vaccination site. Everyone over the age of 16, everyone, is now eligible to get vaccinated right now, right away. Go get vaccinated America. Go and get the vaccination. They’re available. You’re eligible now. When I was sworn in on January 20th, less than 1% of the seniors in America were fully vaccinated against COVID-19. One hundred days later, 70% of seniors in America over 65 are protected, fully protected. Senior deaths from COVID-19 are down 80% since January. Down 80%, because of all of you. And more than half of all the adults in America have gotten at least one shot. A mass vaccination center in Glendale, Arizona, I asked the nurse, I said, “What’s it like?” She looked at me and she said, “It’s like every shot is giving a dose of hope.” That was her phrasing, “A dose of hope.” A dose of hope for an educator in Florida who has a child suffering from an autoimmune disease, wrote to me said she’s worried about bringing the virus home. She said she then got vaccinated at a large site in her car. She said she sat in her car when she got vaccinated and just cried. Cried out of joy and cried out of relief. Parents seeing the smiles on the kids’ faces for those who were able to go back to school because the teachers and school bus drivers and cafeteria workers have been vaccinated. … instead of pressing hands against the window to say goodbye, it means everything. Those things mean everything. There’s still, you all know it, you know it better than any group of Americans. There’s still more work to do to beat this virus. We can’t let our guard down. But tonight I can say it because of you, the American people, our progress these past 100 days against one of the worst pandemics in history, has been one of the greatest logistical achievements this country has ever seen. What else have we done in those first 100 days? We kept our commitment, Democrats and Republicans, of sending $1,400 rescue checks to 85% of American households. We already sent more than 160 million checks out the door. It’s making a difference. You all know it when you go home. For many people it’s making all the difference in the world. A single mom in Texas who wrote me, she said she couldn’t work, but she said the relief check put food on the table and saved her and her son from eviction from their apartment. A grandmother in Virginia who told me she immediately took her granddaughter to the eye doctor, something she said she put off for months because she didn’t have the money. One of the defining images at least from my perspective in this crisis has been cars lined up, cars lined up for miles. Not people who just barely ever start those cars, nice cars lined up for miles, waiting for a box of food to be put in their trunk. I don’t know about you, but I didn’t ever think I’d see that in America. All of this is through no fault of their own. No fault of their own these people are in this position. That’s why the Rescue Plan is delivering food and nutrition assistance to millions of Americans facing hunger, and hunger is down sharply already. We’re also providing rental assistance. You all know this, but the American people I want to make sure they understand. Keeping people from being evicted from their homes. Providing loans to small businesses that reopened and keep their employees on the job. During these 100 days an additional 800,000 Americans enrolled in the Affordable Care Act, when I established a special sign up period to do that. 800,000 in that period. We’re making one of the largest one-time ever investments ever in improving healthcare for veterans. Critical investments to address the opioid crisis. Maybe most importantly, thanks to the American Rescue Plan, we’re on track to cut child poverty in America in half this year. In the process, while this was all going on the economy created more than 1, 300,000 new jobs in 100 days. More jobs in the first 100 days than any president on record. The International Monetary Fund is now estimating our economy will grow at a rate of more than six percent this year. That’d be the fastest pace of economic growth in this country in nearly four decades. America’s moving, moving forward, but we can’t stop now. We’re in competition with China and other countries to win the 21st century. We’re at a great inflection point in history. We have to do more than just build back better. To build back you have to build back better. We have to compete more strenuously than we have. Throughout our history if you think about it, public investment in infrastructure has literally transformed America, our attitudes as well as our opportunities. The transcontinental railroad, the interstate highways, united two oceans and brought a totally new age of progress to the United States of America. Universal public schools and college aid open wide the doors of opportunity. Scientific breakthroughs took us to the moon, now we’re on Mars, discovering vaccines, gave us the internet and so much more. These are investments we made together as one country, and investments that only the government was in a position to make. Time and again they propel us into the future. That’s why I propose the American Jobs Plan, a once in a generation investment in American itself. This is the largest Jobs plan since World War II. It creates jobs to upgrade our transportation infrastructure. Jobs modernizing our roads, bridges, highways. Jobs building ports and airports, rail [inaudible 00:26:01], transit lines. It’s clean water. Today up to 10 million homes in America and more than 400,000 schools and childcare centers have pipes with lead in them, including drinking water, a clear and present danger to our children’s health. American Jobs Plan creates jobs replacing 100% of the nation’s lead pipes and service lines, so every American can drink clean water. The process will create thousands and thousands of good paying jobs. It creates jobs connecting every American with high speed internet, including 35% of the rural America that still doesn’t have it. It’s going to help our kids and our businesses succeed in the 21st century economy. I’m asking the vice president to lead this effort if she would. Of course. Because I know it’ll get done. Creates jobs building a modern power grid. Our grids are vulnerable to storms, hacks, catastrophic failures with tight tragic results, as we saw in Texas and elsewhere during the winter storms. The American Jobs Plan will create jobs to lay thousands of miles of transmission lines needed to build a resilient and fully clean grid. We can do that. Look, the American Jobs Plan will help millions of people get back to their jobs and back to their careers. Two million women have dropped out of the workforce during this pandemic, two million. Too often because they couldn’t get the care they needed to care for their child or care for an elderly parent who needs help. 800,000 families are on the Medicare waiting list right now to get home care for their aging parent or loved one with disability. If you think it’s not important check out in your own district, Democrat or Republican. Democrat or Republican voters, their great concern almost as much as the children is taking care of an elderly loved one who can’t be left alone. Medicaid contemplated it, but this plan is going to help those families and create jobs for our caregivers with better wages and better benefits, continuing to cycle growth. For too long we’ve failed to use the most important word when it comes to meeting the climate crisis, jobs, jobs, jobs. For me when I think climate change I think jobs. The American Jobs Plan will put engineers and construction workers to work building more energy efficient buildings and homes. Electrical workers, IBEW members installing 500,000 charging stations along our highways, so we can own the electric car market. Farmers planting cover crops so they can reduce the carbon dioxide in the air and get paid for doing it. Look, think about it, there is simply no reason why the blades for wind turbines can’t be built in Pittsburgh instead of Beijing. No reason, none, no reason. So folks there’s no reason why American workers can’t lead the world in the production of electric vehicles and batteries, I mean there’s no reason, we have the capacity. We have the brightest best trained people in the world. The American Jobs Plan is going to create millions of good paying jobs, jobs Americans can raise a family on, as my dad would then say with a little breathing room. All the investments in the American Job Plan will be guided by one principle, buy American, buy American. I might note parenthetically, that does not violate any trade agreement, it’s been the law since the 30s buy American. American tax dollars are going to be used to buy American products made in America to create American jobs. That’s the way it’s supposed to be and it will be in this administration. I’ve made it clear to all my cabinet people, their ability to give exemptions has been strenuously limited. It will be American products. Now I know some of you at home are wondering whether these jobs are for you. So many of you, so many of the folks I grew up with feel left behind, forgotten, in an economy that’s so rapidly changing, it’s frightening. I want to speak directly to you. Because you think about it, that’s what people are most worried about, can I fit in? Independent experts estimate the American Jobs Plan will add millions of jobs and trillions of dollars to economic growth in the years to come. It is a eight year program. These are good paying jobs that can’t be outsourced. Nearly 90% of the infrastructure jobs created in American Jobs Plan do not require a college degree. 75% don’t require an associate’s degree. The American Jobs Plan is a blue collar blueprint to build America. That’s what it is. It recognizes something I’ve always said in this chamber and the other, good guys and women are in Wall Street, but Wall Street didn’t build this country. The middle class built the country, and unions built the middle class. That’s why I’m calling on Congress to pass Protect The Right to Organize Act, the PRO Act, and send it to my desk so we can support the right to unionize. By the way, while you’re thinking about sending things to my desk, let’s raise the minimum wage to $15. No one working 40 hours a week should live below the poverty line. We need to ensure greater equity and opportunity for women, and while we’re doing this, let’s get the Paycheck Fairness Act to my desk as well, equal pay. They spent much too long. If you’re wondering whether it’s too long, look behind me. Finally, American Jobs Plan will be the biggest increase in non-defense research and development on record. We’ll see more technological change, and some of you know more about this than I do. We’ll see more technological change in the next 10 years than we saw in the last 50. That’s how rapidly artificial intelligence and so much more is changing. We’re falling behind the competition with the rest of the world. Decades ago, we used to invest two percent of our gross domestic product in America, two percent of our gross domestic product in research and development. Today Mr. Secretary, that’s less than one percent. China and other countries are closing in fast. We have to develop and dominate the products and technologies of the future. Advanced batteries, biotechnology, computer chips, clean energy. The secretary of defense can tell you, and those of you working NASA security issues know, the Defense Department has an agency called DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency. The people who set up before I came here and that’s been a long time ago, to develop breakthroughs that enhance our national security. That’s their only job. It’s a semi-separate agency, it’s under the Defense Department. It’s led to everything from discovery of the internet, to GPS and so much more. It’s enhanced our security. The National Institute of Health, the NIH I believe should create a similar advanced research projects agency for health. This is what it would do, it would have a singular purpose to develop breakthroughs to prevent, detect and treat diseases like Alzheimer’s, diabetes and cancer. I’ll still never forget when we passed the cancer proposal in the last year I was vice president, almost nine million dollars going to NIH. I’ve excused the point of personal privilege, I’ll never forget you standing and mentioning saying name it after my deceased son, it meant a lot. But so many of us have deceased sons, daughters and relatives who died of cancer. I can think of no more worthy investment. I know of nothing that is more bipartisan. So let’s end cancer as we know it, it’s within our power, it’s within our power to do it. Investments in jobs and infrastructure like the ones we’re talking about have often had bipartisan support in the past. Vice President Harris and I met regularly in the Oval Office with Democrats and Republicans and discussed the Jobs Plan. I applaud a group of Republican senators who just put forward their own proposal. So let’s get to work. I wanted to lay out before the Congress my plan, before we got into the deep discussions. I’d like to meet with those who have ideas that are different, they think are better, I welcome those ideas. But the rest of the world is not waiting for us. I just want to be clear, from my perspective doing nothing is not an option. Look, we can’t be so busy competing with one another that we forget the competition that we have with the rest of the world to win the 21st century. Secretary Blinken can tell you I spent a lot of time with President Xi, traveled over 17,000 miles with him. Spent they tell me over 24 hours in private discussions with him. When he called to congratulate me we had a two hour discussion. He’s deadly earnest about becoming the most significant consequential nation in the world. He and others, autocrats, think that democracy can’t compete in the 21st century with autocracies, because it takes too long to get consensus. To win that competition for the future in my view, we also need to make a once in a generation investment in our families and our children. That’s why I’ve introduced the American Families Plan tonight, which addresses four of the biggest challenges facing American families in [inaudible 00:39:54] America. First is access to good education. … of years of public education universal in the last century, it made us the best educated, best prepared nation in the world. It’s, I believe the overwhelming reason that propelled us to wherever we got in the 20th century, but the world has caught up or catching up, they’re not waiting. I would say parenthetically, if we were we’re sitting down, we’ve set a bipartisan committee together and said, “Okay, we’re going to decide what we do in terms of government providing for free education.” I wonder whether we’d think as we did in the 20th century, that 12 years is enough in the 21st century. I doubt it. 12 years is no longer enough today to compete with the rest of the world in 21st century. That’s why my American Families Plan guarantees four additional years of public education to person every America, starting as early as we can. The great universities in this country have conducted studies over last 10 years. It shows that adding in two years of universal high quality pre-school for every three-year-old and four-year-old no matter what background they come from, puts them in the position to be able to compete all the way through 12 years, and increases exponentially their prospect of graduating and going on and beyond graduation. Research shows when a young child goes to school, not daycare, they’re far more likely to graduate from high school, and go to college or something after high school. When you add two years of free community college on top of that, you begin to change the dynamic. We can do that. And we’ll increase Pell Grants and invest in historical black colleges and universities, tribal colleges, minority serving institutions. The reason is, they don’t have the endowments. But their students are just as capable of learning about cyber security, just as capable of learning about metallurgy, all the things that are going on to provide those jobs in the future. Jill was a community college professor who teaches today as First Lady. She’s long said, I’ve heard it once, I’ve heard it, a thousand times, “Joe, any country that out-educates us is going to out-compete us.” She’ll be deeply involved in leading this effort. Thank you, Jill. Second thing we need American Families Plan will provide access to quality, affordable childcare. We guarantee… When I proposed in that legislation, we guarantee that low and middle-income families will pay no more than 7% of their income for high-quality care for children up to the age of five. The most hard-pressed working families won’t have to spend a dime. Third. The American Families Plan will finally provide up to 12 weeks of paid leave and medical leave, family medical leave. We’re one of the few industrial countries in the world, no one should have to choose between a job and a paycheck or taking care of themselves and their loved ones or parent or spouse or child. And forth, the American Family Plan puts directly into the pockets of millions of Americans. In March, we expanded tax credit for every child in a family up to $3,000 per child, if you’re under six years of age, I’m assuming, over six years of age, and $3,600 for children over six years of age. With two parents, two kids, that’s $7,200 in the pockets you’re getting to help take care of your family. And that will help more than 65 million children and help cut childcare poverty in half, and we can afford it. So we did that in the last piece of legislation we passed, but let’s extend that childcare tax credit, at least through the end of 2025. The American Rescue Plan lowered healthcare premiums for 9 million Americans who buy their coverage under the Affordable Care Act. I know that’s really popular on this side of the aisle, but let’s make that provision permanent so their premiums don’t go back up. In addition, to my Families Plan, I’m going to work with Congress to address this year, other critical priorities for American families. The Affordable Care Act has been a lifeline for millions of Americans, protecting people with pre-existing conditions, protecting women’s health, and the pandemic has demonstrated how badly, how badly it’s needed. Let’s lower deductibles for working families in the Affordable Care Act. And let’s lower prescription drug costs. We know how to do this. The last president had that as an objective. We all know how outrageously expensive drugs are in America. In fact, we pay the highest prescription drug prices of anywhere in the world, right here in America. Nearly three times for the same drug, nearly three times what other countries pay. We have to change that and we can. Let’s do what we talked about for all the years I was down here in this body, in Congress. Let’s give Medicare the power to save hundreds of billions of dollars by negotiating lower drug prescription prices. And by the way, it won’t just help people on Medicare, lower prescription drug costs for everyone. And the money we save, which is billions of dollars can go to strengthen the Affordable Care Act, and even expand Medicare coverage benefits without costing taxpayers an additional penny. It’s within our power to do it. Let’s do it now. We’ve talked about it long enough, Democrats and Republicans let’s get it done this year. This is all about a simple premise. Healthcare should be a right and not a privilege in America. So, how do we pay for my jobs with Family Plan? I made it clear, we can do it without increasing the deficits. Let’s start with what I will not do. I will not impose any tax increase on people making less than $400,000, but it’s time for corporate America and the wealthiest 1% of Americans to just begin to pay their fair share. Just their fair share. Sometimes, I have arguments with my friends in the Democratic Party. I think you should be able to become a billionaire and a millionaire, but pay your fair share. Recent study shows that 55 in the nation’s biggest corporations paid zero federal tax last year. Those 55 corporations made an excess of $40 billion in profit. A lot of companies also evade taxes through tax havens and Switzerland and Bermuda and the Cayman Islands. And they benefit from tax loopholes and deductions for offshoring jobs and shifting profits overseas. It’s not right. We’re going to reform corporate taxes so they pay their fair share and help pay for the public investments their businesses will benefit from as well. We’re going to reward work, not just wealth. We take the top tax bracket for the wealthiest 1% of Americans, those making over $400,000 or more, back up to where it was when George W. Bush was president, when it started, 39.6%. That’s where it was when George W. was president. We’re going to get rid of the loopholes and allow Americans to make more than a million dollars a year and pay a lower tax rate on their capital gains than Americans who receive a paycheck. We’re only going to affect three tenths of 1% of all Americans by that action, three tenths of 1%. And the IRS is going to crack down on millionaires and billionaires who cheat on their taxes. It’s estimated to be billions of dollars by think tanks of the left, right and center. I’m not looking to punish anybody. But I will not add a tax burden, additional tax burden of middle-class in this country. They’re already paying enough. I believe what I propose is fair, fiscally responsible and it raises revenue to pay for the plans I propose and will create millions of jobs that will grow the economy and enhance our financial standing in the country. When you hear someone say they don’t want to raise taxes on the wealthiest 1% or corporate America, ask them, “Whose taxes do you want to raise?” And instead, whose are we going to cut. Look, the big tax cut of 2017. You remember, it was supposed to pay for itself, that was how it was sold. And generate vast economic growth. Instead, it added $2 trillion to the deficit. It was a huge windfall for corporate America and those at the very top. Instead of using the tax saving to raise wages and invest in research and development, it poured billions of dollars into the pocket of the CEOs. In fact, the pay gap between CEOs and their workers is now among the largest in history. According to one study, CEOs make 320 times what the average worker in their corporation makes. Used to be in the, below 100. The pandemic is only made things worse. 20 million Americans lost their job in the pandemic, working and middle-class Americans. At the same time, roughly 650 billionaires in America saw their net worth increase by more than $1 trillion, in the same exact period. Let me say it again, 650 people increase their wealth by more than $1 trillion during this pandemic. And they’re now worth more than $4 trillion. My fellow Americans trickle-down. Trickle-down economics has never worked, and it’s time to grow the economy from the bottom and the middle out. There’s a broad consensus of economist left, right and center, and they agree what I’m proposing will help create millions of jobs and generate historic economic growth. These are among the highest values in investments we can make as a nation. I’ve often said, “Our greatest strength is the power of our example, not just the example of our power.” My conversations with world leaders, and I’ve spoken to over 38, 40 of them now. I’ve made it known that America’s back. You know what they say? A comment that I hear most of all for them. So they say, “We see America’s back, but for how long? But for how long?” My fellow Americans, we have to show not just that we’re back, but we’re back to stay. And that we aren’t going to go alone. We’re going to do it by leading with our allies. No one nation to deal with all of the crises of our time from terrorism, to nuclear proliferation, mass migration, cybersecurity, climate change, as well as what we’re experiencing now with pandemics. There’s no wall high enough to keep any virus out. And our own vaccine supply, as it grows to meet our needs and we’re meeting them, we’ll become an arsenal for vaccines for other countries, just as America’s the arsenal for democracy for the world. And the consequence influence of the world. But every American will have access before that… Every American will have access to be fully covered by COVID-19 for the vaccines we have. Look, the climate crisis is not our fight alone. It’s a global fight. The United States accounts as all of you know, less than 50% of carbon emissions. The rest of the world accounts for 85%. That’s why I kept my commitment to rejoin the Paris Accord, because if we do everything perfectly, it’s not going to only matter. I kept my commitment to convene a climate summit right here in America, with all the major economies of the world, China, Russia, India, European Union. I said I’d do it my first 100 days. I want to be very blunt about it. My attempt was to make sure that the world could see there was a consensus that we are at an inflection point in history. And consensus is if we act to save the planet, we can create millions of jobs and economic growth and opportunity to raise the standard of living to almost everyone around the world. If you’d watched any of it and you were all busy, I’m sure you didn’t have much time. That’s what virtually every nation said. Even the ones that aren’t doing their fair share. The investments I proposed tonight also advance the foreign policy, in my view, the benefits of the middle class. That means making sure every nation plays by the same rules in the global economy, including China. In my discussion with President Xi, I told him we welcome the competition. We’re not looking for conflict, but I made absolutely clear that we will defend America’s interests across the board. America will stand up to unfair trade practices and undercut American workers and American industries, like subsidies from state to state-owned operations and enterprises, and the theft of American technology intellectual property. I also told President Xi, that we’ll maintain a strong military presence in the Indo-Pacific just as we do with NATO and Europe. Not to start a conflict, but to prevent one. I told him what I’ve said to many world leaders that America will not back away from our commitments. Our commitment to human rights and fundamental freedoms and our alliances. I pointed out to him, no responsible American president could remain silent when basic human rights are being so blatantly violated. An American president has to represent the essence of what our country stands for. America is an idea. The most unique idea in history. We are created all of us equal. It’s who we are, and we cannot walk away from that principle, and in fact, say we’re dealing with the American idea. With regard to Russia, I know it concerns some of you, but I made it very clear to Putin that we’re not going to seek escalation, but their actions will have consequence if they turn out to be true and they turned out to be true. So I responded directly proportionally to Russia’s interference on our elections and the cyber attacks on our government and our business. They did both of these things, and I told them we would respond and we have. But we can also cooperate when it’s our mutual interest. We did it when we extended the New START Treaty on nuclear arms, and we’re working to do it on climate change. But he understands, we will respond on Iran and North Korea, nuclear programs that present serious threats to American security and the security of the world. We’re going to be working closely with our allies to address the threats posed by both of these countries, through diplomacy as well as stern deterrence. And American leadership means ending the forever war in Afghanistan. We have, without hyperbole the greatest fighting force in the history of the world. I’m the first president in 40 years that knows what it means to have a son serving in a war zone. Today, we have service members serving in the same war zone as their parents did. We have service members in Afghanistan who were not yet born on 9/11. The war in Afghanistan, as we remember the debates here, were never meant to be multi-generational undertakings of nation building. We went to Afghanistan to get terrorists, the terrorists who attacked us on 9/11. And we said we would follow Osama bin Laden to the gates of hell to do it. If you’d been in the upper Kunar Valley, you’ve kind of seen the gates of hell. And we delivered justice to bin Laden. We degraded the terrorist threat of Al Qaeda in Afghanistan. And after 20 years of value, valor and sacrifice, it’s time to bring those troops home. Look, even as we do, we’ll maintain over the rise in capacity to suppress future threats to the Homeland. And make no mistake. In 20 years, terrorism has metastasized. The threat is way beyond Afghanistan. Those of you in the intelligence committees, the foreign relations committee, defense committees, you know well, we have to remain vigilant against the threats to the United States wherever they come from. Al Qaeda and ISIS are in Yemen, Syria, Somalia, other places in Africa, in the Middle East and beyond. And we won’t ignore what our intelligence agencies have determined to be the most lethal terrorist threat to the Homeland today. White supremacy is terrorism. We’re not going to ignore that either. My fellow Americans, look, we have to come together to heal the soul of this nation. It was nearly a year ago before her father’s funeral when I spoke with Gianna Floyd, George Floyd’s young daughter. She’s a little tike, so I was kneeling down to talk to her so I could look her in the eye. She looked at me, she said, “My daddy changed the world.” Well, after the conviction of George Floyd’s murderer, we can see how right she was if we have the courage to act as a Congress. We’ve all seen the name and justice on the neck of black Americans. Now’s our opportunity to make some real progress. The vast majority of men and women wearing a uniform and a badge serve our communities and they serve them honorably. I know them. I know they want to help meet this moment as well. My fellow Americans, we have to come together to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the people they serve, to root out systemic racism in our criminal justice system, and enact police reform in George Floyd’s name that passed the house already. I know Republicans have their own ideas and are engaged in very productive discussions with Democrats in the Senate. We need to work together to find a consensus, but let’s get it done next month by the first anniversary of George Floyd’s death. The country supports this reform and Congress should act. We have a giant opportunity to bend the arc of the moral universe towards justice, real justice. And with the plans outlined tonight, we have a real chance to root out systemic racism that plagues America and American lives in other ways, the chance to deliver real equity. Good jobs, good schools, affordable housing, clean air, clean water, being able to generate wealth and pass it down to generations because you have access to purchase a house. Real opportunities in the lives of more Americans, Black, White, Latino, Asian Americans, Native Americans. Look, I also want to thank the United States Senate for voting 94 to one to pass COVID-19 hate crimes act to protect Asian-American and Pacific Islanders. You acted decisively. You could see on television the viciousness of the hate crimes we’ve seen over the past year and for too long. I urge the House to do the same and send that legislation to my desk, which I will gladly, anxiously sign. I also hope Congress will get to my desk the equality act to protect LGBTQ Americans. To all transgender Americans watching at home, especially young people, you’re so great. I want you to know your president has your back. Another thing. Let’s authorize the Violence Against Women Act, which has been law for 27 years. 27 years ago, I wrote it. It’ll close the act that has to be authorized now will close the boyfriend loophole to keep guns out of the hands of abusers. The court order said this is an abuser. You can’t own a gun. It’s to close that loophole that existed. It’s estimated that 50 women are shot and killed by an intimate partner every month in America. 50 a month. Let’s pass it and save some lives. I need not tell anyone this, but gun violence has become an epidemic in America. A flag at the White House was still flying at half mast for the eight victims of the mass shooting in Georgia. When 10 more lives were taken in a mass shooting in Colorado. And in the weekend between those two events, 250 other Americans were shot dead in the streets of America. 250 shot dead. I know how hard it is to make progress on this issue. In the nineties, we passed universal background checks, a ban on assault weapons and high capacity magazines that hold a hundred rounds that can be fired off in seconds. We beat the NRA. Mass shootings and gun violence declined. Check out the report over 10 years. But in the early 2000s, the law expired and we’ve seen daily bloodshed since. I’m not saying if the law continued, we wouldn’t see bloodshed. More than two weeks ago in the Rose Garden, surrounded by some of the bravest people I know, the survivors and families who lost loved ones to gun violence, I laid out several of the Department of Justice actions that are being taken to impact in this epidemic. One of them is banning so-called ghost guns. These are homemade guns built from a kit that includes directions how to finish the firearm. The parts have no serial numbers. So they show up at crime scenes and they can’t be traced. The buyers of these ghost gun kits aren’t required to pass any background check. Anyone from a criminal or terrorist could buy this kit, and within 30 minutes have a weapon that’s lethal. But no more. I’ll do everything in my power to protect the American people from this epidemic of gun violence, but it’s time for Congress to act as well. I don’t want to become confrontational, but we need more Senate Republicans to join the overall majority of Democrat colleagues, close the loopholes required in background check purchases of guns. We need a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Don’t tell me it can’t be done. We did it before, and it worked. Talk to most responsible gun owners and hunters. They’ll tell you there’s no possible justification for having a hundred rounds in a weapon. What do you think, deer are wearing Kevlar vests? I’ll tell you that there’s too many people a day were able to buy a gun but shouldn’t be able to buy a gun. These kinds of reasonable reforms have overwhelming support from the American people including many gun owners. The country supports reform and Congress should act. This shouldn’t be a red or blue issue, and no amendment to the Constitution is absolute. You can’t yell fire in a crowded theater. From the very beginning, there were certain guns, weapons, that could not be owned by Americans. Certain people could not own those weapons ever. We’re not changing the Constitution. We’re being reasonable. I think this is not a Democrat or Republican issue. I think it’s an America issue. And here’s what else we can do. Immigration has always been essential to America. Let’s end our exhausting war over immigration. For more than 30 years, politicians have talked about immigration reform and we’ve done nothing about it. It’s time to fix it. On day one of my presidency, I kept my commitments in a comprehensive immigration bill to the United States Congress. If you believe we need to secure the border, pass it because it has a lot of money for high-tech border security. If you believe in a pathway to citizenship, pass it. Over 11 million undocumented folks, the vast majority here, overstaying visas. Pass it. If you actually want to solve a problem, I’ve sent a bill to you. Take a close look at it. We also have to get at the root problem of why people are fleeing, particularly to our Southern border from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. The violence, the corruption, the gangs, the political instability, hunger, hurricanes, earthquakes, natural disasters. When I was vice-president, president asked me to focus on providing help needed to address the root causes of migration. And it helped keep people in their own countries instead of being forced to leave. The plan was working, but the last administration decided it was not worth it. I’m restoring the program and asked Vice President Harris to lead our diplomatic effort to take care of this. I have absolute confidence she’ll get the job done. Now look, if you don’t like my plan, let’s at least pass what we all agree on. Congress needs to pass legislation this year to finally secure protection for dreamers. The young people that only know America as their own. And permanent protection for immigrants who are here on temporary protective status who came from countries that are set by man-made and natural made violence and disaster. As well as a pathway to citizenship for farm workers who put food on our tables. Look, immigrants have done so much for America during this pandemic and throughout our history. Our country supports immigration reform. We should act. Let’s argue over it. Let’s debate it, but let’s act. And if we truly want to restore the soul of America, we need to protect the sacred right to vote. More people voted in the last presidential election than any time in American history in the middle of the worst pandemic ever. It should be celebrated. Instead it’s being attacked. Congress should pass HR 1 and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and send it to my desk right away. The country supports it, and Congress should act now. Look, in conclusion, as we gather here tonight, the image of a violent mob assaulting this Capitol, desecrating our democracy remain vivid in all our minds. Lives were put at risk. Many of your lives. Lives were lost. Extraordinary courage is summoned. The insurrection was an existential crisis, a test on whether our democracy could survive and it did. But the struggle is far from over. The question of whether a democracy will long endure is both ancient and urgent. As old as our Republic. Still vital today. Can our democracy deliver to the most pressing needs of our people? Can our democracy overcome the lies, anger, hate and fears that have pulled us apart? America’s adversaries, the autocrats of the world, are betting we can’t. And I promise you they’re betting we can’t. They believe we’re too full of anger and division and rage. They look at the images of the mob that assault at the Capitol as proof that sun is setting on an American democracy, but they’re wrong. You know it. I know it. But we have to prove them wrong. We have to prove democracy still works, that our government still works and we can deliver for our people. In our first 100 days together, we’ve acted to restore people’s faith in democracy to deliver. We’re vaccinating the nation. We’re creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs. We’re delivering real results to people. They can see it, feel it in their own lives, opening doors of opportunity, guaranteeing some more fairness and justice. That’s the essence of America. That’s democracy in action. Our Constitution opens with the words as trade as it sounds, “We, the people.” It’s time to remember that we, the people are the government. You and I. Not some force in a distant Capitol, not some powerful force that we have no control over. It’s us. It’s we, the people. In another era when our democracy was tested, Franklin Roosevelt reminded us in America, we do our part. We all do our part. That’s all I’m asking, that we do our part, all of us. If we do that, we will meet the center challenge of the age by proving that democracy is durable and strong. Autocrats will not win the future. We will. America will, and the future belongs to America. As I stand here tonight before you in a new and vital hour of life and democracy of our nation, I can say with absolute confidence I have never been more confident or optimistic about America. Not because I’m president, because what’s happening with the American people. We’ve stared into the abyss of insurrection and autocracy, pandemic and pain. And we, the people did not flinch. At the very moment our adversaries were certain we’d pull apart and fail, we came together, we united. With light and hope, we summoned the new strength, new resolve to position us to win the competition of 21st century on our way to a union more perfect, more prosperous and more just as one people, one nation and one America. Folks, as I told every world leader I’ve ever met with over the years, it’s never, ever, ever been a good bet to bet against America. And it still isn’t. We’re the United States of America. There is not a single thing, nothing beyond our capacity. We can do whatever we set our minds to if we do it together. So let’s begin to get together. God bless you all and may God protect our troops. Thank you for your patience. Thank you. Thank you."
"69","04-29-21"," Wow, what a great crowd. Thanks for coming. Thank you, Long. Joe and I had the chance to see our friends. We just saw them, President and former First Lady Carter, and they are such a powerful reminder that serving our country isn’t limited to the office you hold. The Carter’s continue their work, making our country stronger every day, and we are grateful and honored for their friendship. And wow, I’m so glad to be with all of you. Thank you for being here. From Columbus to Albany, Macon to Atlanta, I’ve always felt so at home here, and I’m especially excited to be back in the state that sent Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff to the Senate. And you know, Georgia, we could not have passed the American Rescue Plan without you. In some ways it’s hard to believe that it’s already been 100 days. Back in D.C., we’re still getting to know our new home, figuring out where the light switches are, and remembering to use coasters on the historic furniture. But in other ways, we’ve packed so much into the time that’s just flown by. I’ve already traveled to schools and community colleges across the country, visited vaccine sites and military bases, and charted the course for our Joining Forces initiative. So thank you to all the military who are here. And that’s just my office. Across the administration, we’ve made historic progress all because of the historic leadership of my husband. You hear them honking their horns for you, Joe? And what drew me to Joe all those years ago was his fortitude. Beneath his kindness, his charm, and good humor was a man of action who always kept his promises, did the necessary work and showed up when it mattered, and that’s why I have always believed that he would be the president that we need. In the first 100 days of this administration, America is seeing the true character of the person that I have known for so long. Whose heart is big enough to comfort the families of more than 500,000 lost, whose vision is ambitious enough to make the investment of a generation, whose determination is strong enough to bring Americans from all walks of life together, whose commitment is stedfast enough to not only keep his promises, but surpass them. Joe is a man for this moment and with his leadership, we are rising. I couldn’t be more proud of what he’s done in just 100 days or more hopeful of what we are going to do next. Please help me in welcoming my husband, the President of the United States, Joe Biden. Hello Georgia, and the other county back there. I love you. A lot of folks out here tonight. Well, I’m ready to go home because she never says that to me at home. I was, this is worth the trip, hearing that. I am Jill’s husband, it’s obvious to everybody. I never get introduced as she’s my wife, I’m her husband, and I’m proud to be. I want to thank Long Tran for being with us tonight. His story is a story of an entire generation, but it’s a story that goes back many generations. Not just in South Vietnam and in Asia, writ large, but all over the world. And in America, it’s the reason why we’re strong. We are the most diverse democracy in the world and we do … There’s not a single thing. I mean this from the bottom of my heart, there’s not a single thing we can’t do when we do it together. So thank you all. And I want to thank my friend, Keisha Lance Bottoms, and thanks to democratic members of Congress, Senator Ossoff and Warnock, Representative Sanford Bishop, an old friend, Hank Johnson and Lucy Macbeth. And look, I want to make sure Representative Williams is here. I thought I saw her a moment ago. There you are, okay. And Representative Carolyn Bourdeaux. We need to work and help them keep their seats. It’s important. We won the first round, but there’s more coming up. And my good friend and DNC Chair, Jaime Harrison, from South Carolina. And Stacey Abrams, who can be anything she wants to be, from whatever she chooses to president. I want to thank you, Stacy, for empowering the people to vote and to make their voices heard. You’ve been amazing. And most of all, I want to thank you, the people of Georgia. We’ll give you a microphone. Folks. Georgia was … 100 days ago today when I was inaugurated on the steps of the United States Capitol to be your president, and I was looking forward to coming back and seeing these things. I agree with you. I’m working on it, man. Give me another five days. Folks, y’all know what they’re talking about. There should be no private prisons period, none, period. That’s what they’re talking about, private detention centers. They should not exist and we are working to close all of them. So folks, look. [inaudible 00:08:56] we nothing done from you. We don’t need you. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Thank you. All right. Okay. Let them go. No, no, no. I promise you, the only things that can keep me from doing that as you keep moving. I promise you. Thank you. Folks. Our families are dying. Look, it’s 100 days since I first sat at my desk in the Oval Office and went to work for you and American people. I want to thank you and I want to thank the American people because I think we’ve gotten a lot done. I promised even before I was sworn in that I would get, in my first 100 days, 100 million COVID vaccine shots in people’s arms. We’ve lost over 550,000 Americans. Well, we delivered over 220 million COVID shots in the first 100 days. We vastly expanded access and we’ve got 100 million doses of vaccine, enough for every single American. And we’ve done it by getting vaccines to some 40,000 pharmacies across the country, 700 community centers. And now everyone over the age of 16 is now eligible to get vaccinated right away. So please do it, get vaccinated now, now, now, now. And we promised to deliver emergency relief to the millions of Americans who were in financial distress, and I might add through no fault of their own. So we got out $1,400 checks to the American people, and we kept that promise. 85% of the households in America have gotten those checks. We’ve already sent out more than 160 million checks out the door. And I want to stop here and give thanks to both your Senators, Senators’ Ossoff and Warnock for making it happen. Because those two votes, had we not come back and you elected them, those two votes made the difference. It passed by a single vote. And that means we owe special thanks to the people of Georgia. Because of you, the rest of the world, because of your two Senators, the rest of America was able to get the help they got so far. The American Rescue Plan would not have passed. So much have we gotten done, like getting checks to people probably would not have happened. So if you ever wonder if elections make a difference, just remember what you did here in Georgia when you elected Ossoff and Warnock. You began to change the environment. And look, because of you, we passed one of the most consequential rescue bills in American history. So what did you do? What did you do with your vote here in Georgia? Well, you changed America. You began to change America and you’re helping us prove that democracy, democracy can still deliver for the people. Look, I want to thank you for all of that. All America wants to thank you because here’s what we mean by delivering for the people. We created, in the first 100 days, 1,300,000 new jobs, 1,300,000 jobs in 100 days. That’s more new jobs in the first 100 days of any president in history. Folks, because you. And we’re here, just a few more things that we did. We provided food and nutrition assistance for children and families so they don’t go hungry, rental assistance to keep people from being evicted from their homes, loans to small businesses, like Long’s, to keep people, to keep them open and people employed. And we made Georgia eligible to expand Medicaid, which means another 500,000 Georgians can be covered. Excuse me. Folks, healthcare should be a right, not a privilege in America. That’s right. Yeah. And Here’s the thing I’m most proud of. We are on track to cut child poverty in half this year by having passed the Child Tax Credit, in half. But as much as we’ve done, we got a lot more to do. That’s why I proposed the American Jobs Plan. It’s a once in a generation investment in America. It’s the biggest jobs plan in this country since World War II. And here’s what it does, it creates jobs rebuilding and modernizing our roads, our highways, our bridges, our ports, our airports. It will provide clean drinking water for every American. There are 10 million homes in America and there are 400,000 schools and daycare centers that have lead pipes where drinking the water is a danger. We’re going to replace 100% of those nation’s lead pipes and service lines so every child can have a turn at the faucet and know what they’re drinking is clean water. Folks, we’re going to provide reliable high-speed internet everywhere in America, including rural America. 15% of Georgia households do not have internet at all. We’re going to change that, and those infrastructure projects are going to create millions of good paying jobs just installing them. We also know that two million women, two million women have dropped out of the workforce during this pandemic, two million. Because too often, they have to choose between whether or not they can get care for their child and their family, or go to work. In the 21st century, infrastructure isn’t just steel and concrete, it’s people, and it’s time we start paying people who come to our homes and care for people that love them and going to take care of them. And folks, when a lot of people talk about climate, they forget to mention the most important word. I made a promise when I was down here running that I would, in fact, immediately rejoin the Paris Climate Accord on day one, which we did. And I would have, in the 100 days, a climate summit here in America, inviting all the world’s polluters and all the world’s emitters, including the biggest nations in the world. And they came, everyone from Russia to China to the European Union to India, all of them. And do you know what came across? Every single one of those countries, whether they’re going to meet their obligations or not, is finally understanding that taking care of saving the planet is going to create millions of good paying jobs, millions of good paying jobs. We’re going to put engineers and construction workers, electricians, electrical workers, building efficient buildings and homes. We’re going to install 500,000 charging stations along the highways we’re going to rebuild, and there’s no reason why the blades for windmills turbines can’t be built in Pittsburgh instead of Beijing. There’s no reason. There’s no reason American workers can’t lead the world in the production of electric vehicles and the batteries propel them. We can do what we need to do in saving the planet and yet create millions of good paying jobs, folks. And with all the investments in the American Jobs Plan, here’s what we’re going to do. We’re going to buy America. Let me explain what that means. It’s not a violation of any trade agreement. Every tax dollar that we, in fact, get for construction of anything is going to go to be used to buy American products made in America that create American jobs. That’s the way it should be. Because look, folks, Wall Street didn’t build this country. You did, the middle-class did, and unions built the middle class. And here’s one final thing I want to mention about the American Jobs Plan. We got a $5 billion investment in that plan for community violence intervention. There’s a lot of work we have to do, there’s a lot of work we have to do, and I want you to know who is responsible for that, Mayor Keisha Bottoms, Keisha Lance Bottoms. But folks, we not only have to invest in America, we need to invest in our families. We need to invest in things our families about and need the most. That’s why the American Family Plan does four things and we pay for it all. One, without raising the deficit, it adds four years more guaranteed public education in America. I don’t think so. So when we did that last century, it made America the best educated and best prepared nation in the world. But the rest of the world has caught up to us now. So my plan provides a universal preschool for every three and four year old in America. Everyone, that’s a game changer. It’s a game changer. And it also provides two years of free community college. That’s a game changer as well. Jill is a community college professor, still teaching. She constantly says, “Joe, community colleges can change the lives of students.” She’ll often say, “Look, any country that educates us is going to out-compete us.” She’ll be leading one of these efforts as well. But one more thing, we’ve got some great historical black universities and colleges in Georgia, and we’re going to be investing in them and investing in them and increasing Pell grants. They don’t have have the back, all the money that comes from the large universities, but their students are as competent to do anything in the future as anyone else. But here’s the deal, we’re going to provide up to $47 billion over 10 years to increase their capacity to do everything. But Jill was … Cyber security, all those things where the jobs of the future are. The second thing we’re going to do, provide quality affordable childcare. I know, I was a single dad for five years when my wife and daughter got killed right after I got elected the United States Senate as a 29-year-old kid. What happened was I was lucky. I had a daughter … I had two boys survived. My daughter and wife were killed, but my two boys survived, and fortunately for me, I had an incredible family. My sister, my brother, and my mother and father, they basically moved in and helped me raise my kids. Because although I was a Senator, I was listed as the poorest Senator in history, but … not history, but the years I was there, I couldn’t afford the cost of daycare. I couldn’t afford the cost of childcare, but I had them. I don’t know how I would’ve done it without them. And so I understand how important childcare can be. Under my plan, most folks won’t pay more than 7% of their income for childcare as a max, and the folks who need it the most and can’t afford it all won’t have to spend a dime. That’s important. And the third thing is the American Family Plan will finally provide up to 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave. No one, no one should have to choose between a job and a paycheck or taking care of themselves, a loved one, a parent, or a spouse or a child. And fourth, the American Family Plan puts money directly into the pockets of millions of families. The American Rescue Plan we passed, we passed the Child Credit. We’re going to expand that Child Credit to families for another five years, families with two kids. That will mean that as much as $7,200 will go into their pockets every year. Georgia, this is a tax cut for more than two million families in Georgia. We’re cutting taxes for people by a tax credit and we’ll lift more than 170,000 children out of poverty right here in America and cut child poverty this year in half. Folks, so how are we going to pay for all of this? Well with tax cuts for the middle class and working class families, how are we going to pay for that? Well, it’s real simple. It’s about time the very wealthy and corporations start paying their fair share. It’s about time. It’s simple as that. And folks, I’m not going to bore you with the details, but I promise you no one making under $400,000 a year is going to pay a single additional penny in tax, no one. As I said last night, the middle class and working people in this country already paying enough in taxes. It’s time for the richest 1% of Americans and corporate America to start to do their part. Let me just give you a simple fact. Last year, for example, 55 of our largest corporations in America paid $0 in federal tax, zero, and they made $40 billion, not a penny in tax. Folks, if in fact we had a minimum book tax for corporations for just the Fortune 500 companies, just a minimum tax of 15%. I bet all you’d sign up for 15% tax right now. If in fact it was just 15%, we’d raise $230 billion, pay for all this. So folks, I’m trying to punish anyone, but we’ve got to make corporations making 40 billion paying zero is just not right. Something’s seriously wrong here. Georgia, I think a lot of you know I ran for president saying we had to heal the soul of this nation, and that’s what we have to do. And the conviction of George Floyd’s murderer is now our opportunity to make some real progress to restore the soul of this country, and we can do it. We can act rational police reform. We can root out systemic racism in our criminal justice system. And with real plans I outlined today, we have a real chance to deliver real equity across the board to everyone, black, white, Latino, Asian-American. Good jobs, good schools, affordable housing, clean air, clean water. Look, being able to generate wealth and pass it down through generations is how most folks got there. But it means, how do most of the middle-class folks you know, who are Caucasian or white, how’d they make it well? They were able to get enough money to buy a home and they built equity in that home and they built equity in that home and they passed it on and they passed it on, and that’s how you build wealth. Well, we’re going to make sure that African-Americans, as well as make sure that Latinos and Asian-Americans are able to build that kind of wealth. Look, when the vice president and I were in Atlanta last month, we met with leaders of the Asian-American community in Georgia, following the mass shootings here in Atlanta. It was a raw and powerful meeting and a very emotional moment, and some criticized me for speaking out nationally about that hate crime. Some criticized me for saying how ugly and sinister it was. Well since then, because of the two Senators you sent, among others, the United States Senate passed the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, protect Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders from the vicious hate crimes we’ve seen too often and too long. And it passed 94 to one. So don’t tell me we can’t make progress. It’s a first step and we have a lot more to do. That’s right. If we are to truly heal the soul of America, we need to project that sacred right of protected to vote. In this state of Dr. King and John Lewis, you know how precious and how precarious the right to vote is. In November and then again in January, your vote changed the world, not just north, the world. But instead of celebrating that, it’s being attacked. More people voted for president in 2020 than any time in American history ever and they did it in the middle of a pandemic. You’ve seen what’s happening here in Georgia with your state’s laws, it’s just wrong, wrong. And it’s why we have to pass the voting rights protection laws coming through the Congress. Right now, H.R. 1 and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act both should be passed now. So folks it’s only been 100 days, but I have to tell you, I’ve never been more optimistic about the future in America. America is on the move again. We’re choosing hope over fear, truth over lies, light over darkness, and we’re working. We’re working again. We’re dreaming again. We’re discovered again, and we’re leading the world again. And you’re proving democracy can deliver for the people. We just need to remember who we are. We are the United States of America and there’s nothing, nothing, nothing we can not do if we do it together. So let’s stay together. God bless you all and may God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Georgia. I see two guys in the back I want to come here."
"70","04-30-21"," And your first 100 days, you proposed $6 trillion in new spending and you plan to pay for it by raising taxes on people, on businesses, on investments. That’s the reason why it’s recovering because we’re investing. Look how rapidly it’s recovered since we passed the last piece of legislation, and that legislation was $1.9 trillion. If we don’t invest in this country, we’re going to fall behind even further. Democrats, Republicans for generations have been, shall we say, skeptical about the ability of big government to do big things. Well, first of all, the facts don’t reflect that. I don’t have any inordinate faith in government, but there’s certain things only the government can do. We rank number eight in the world in terms of infrastructure for God’s sake. Is the private sector going to go out and build billions of dollars worth of highways, ports, airports, bridges? Are they going to do that? And so these are things that only government can really do. I watched the speech last night. I watched the address and then I watched the rebuttal from the junior Senator of South Carolina last night, Tim Scott. He said, among other things, America isn’t racist. No, I don’t think the American people are racist, but I think after 400 years, African-Americans have been left in a position where they’re so far behind the eight ball in terms of education, health, in terms of opportunity. I don’t think America is racist, but I think the overhang from all of the Jim Crow and before that slavery have had a cost and we have to deal with it. Let’s talk about the pandemic. It is a defined your first 100 days. There’s a recent poll that came out that showed 40% of Marines said, they’re not going to get vaccinated. I don’t know. I’m going to leave that to the military. Well, I’m not saying I won’t. I think you’re going to see more and more of them getting it. I think it’s going to be a tough call as to whether or not they should be required to have to get it in the military because you’re in such close proximity with other military personnel, whether you’re in quarters where you’re all sleeping or whether you’re out in maneuvers. Kids in K through 12 schools, obviously are not going to be able to get the vaccine by the fall. Based on the science and the CDC, they should probably all be open. There’s not overwhelming evidence that there’s much of a transmission among these young people. CDC guidance this week about outdoor mask wearing. A lot of folks excited that they can now shed these masks if they’ve been double vaccinated. Sure, sure. I mean, but what I’m going to do though, because the likelihood of my being able to be outside and people not come up to me is not very, very high. So it’s like, look, you and I took our masks off when I came in because look at the distance we are. But if we were in fact sitting there talking to one another close, I’d have my mask on and I’d make you to have a mask, even though we both been vaccinated. And so it’s a small precaution to take that has a profound impact. It’s a patriotic responsibility for God’s sake. It’s making sure that your wife, your children, if in fact they haven’t been vaccinated, making sure that they’re not going to get sick. Before you took office in January, you laid out four crises that demanded urgent action. The pandemic was obviously one of them. The economic fallout as a result of the pandemic was one of them, climate change, and in racial inequality. Immigration was not one of the crises that demanded urgent action in January. It is getting urgent action. Now, for example, a month ago, we had thousands of young kids in custody in places they shouldn’t be, controlled by the border patrol. We have now cut that down dramatically. Hey, look, here’s what happened, Craig. The failure to have a real transition, the two departments that didn’t give us access to virtually anything were the Immigration and the Defense Department. So we didn’t find out they had fired a whole lot of people, that they were understaffed considerably. But in April alone, Mr. President, 170,000 people, migrants apprehended at the border to 20 year record. There are 22,000 unaccompanied children in our country right now. That’s a record. That sounds to most folks like a crisis. Well, look, it’s way down now. We’ve now gotten control. For example, they didn’t plan for which it comes every year, this flow, whether it’s 26,000 or 10,000, they didn’t have the beds that were available. They didn’t plan for the overflow. They didn’t plan for the Department of Health and Human Services to have places to take the kid from the border patrol and put them in beds where there were security and there were people that could take care of them. So there’s a significant change right now, significant change in the circumstance for children coming to and at the border. During the campaign, you pledged to reunite hundreds of children who have been separated from their parents by the previous administration. According to our reporting and in your first 100 days, not one child has been reunited. I don’t think that’s true, but that could be. What we have done is we have united children with their families as they’ve come across the border, but one of the things is we don’t know yet where those kids are. We’re trying like hell to figure out what happened. It’s almost like being a sleuth and we’re still continuing to try like hell to find out where they are. You said to migrants, don’t come. You said, don’t come. You’re very clear. Or would you tell parents in Central American Mexico, don’t send your kids. Absolutely. And look, here’s the deal. So don’t send your kids. Do not send your kids, period. There are most they’re in jeopardy going and making that thousand mile trek. And so what we’re doing now is we’re going back to those countries in question where most of its coming from and saying, look, you can apply from your country. You don’t have to make this trek. Federal investigators searched the home and the office of Rudy Giuliani as part of an investigation into his time as President Trump’s attorney, his dealings with Ukraine. I gave him my word, I was not. I made a pledge. I would not interfere in any way, order or try to stop any investigation the Justice Department had in way. I learned about that last night when the rest of the world learned about it. No, and I’m not asking to be briefed. I’m not asking to brief. That’s the Justice Department’s independent judgment. This last administration politicized the Justice Department so badly, so many of them quit. The Justice Department is the people’s lawyer. Not the President’s lawyer. We should note that Rudy Giuliani responded to that overnight saying whether President Biden knew or not, he is being unfairly targeted as well."
"71","05-01-20"," Okay, let’s bring in the apparent Democratic nominee for President, former Vice President Joe Biden. Mr. Vice President, thank you for coming on the show this morning. Happy to be with you. We have a lot we want to ask you this morning. Joe and Willie will join in just a moment for questions on how you would handle this pandemic, that campaign and other news of the day. But at the start it’s just going to be you and me and I want to get right to the allegation made against you by Tara Reade. So the former Senate aide accuses you of sexual assault and please to our viewers, please excuse the graphic nature of this, but I want to make sure that there is no question as to what we’re talking about. She says in 1993 Mr. Vice President, that you pinned her against the wall and reached under her clothing and penetrated her with your fingers. No, it is not true. I’m saying unequivocally it never, never happened and it didn’t. It never happened. I don’t remember any type of complaint she may have made. It was 27 years ago and I don’t remember, nor does anyone else that I’m aware of. And the fact is that I don’t remember. I don’t remember any complaint ever having been made. No, I have not reached out to her, it was 27 years ago there. This never happened and when she first made the claim we made it clear that it never happened. And that’s as simple as that. In the past 30 minutes or so you released a statement on medium and among other things you write this, “There’s only one place, a complaint of this kind could be, the National Archives. I am requesting that the Secretary of State ask of the Senate ask the archives to identify any record of the complaint she alleges she filed. If there was any such complaint, the record will be there. I’m confident there’s nothing. No one ever brought it to the attention of me 27 years ago, if this has any assertion at all, no one that I’m aware of in my campaign, my Senate office at the time is aware of any such a request or any such complaint and so I’m not worried about it at all. If there is a complaint, that’s where it would be, that’s were It’d be filed and if it’s there put it out, but I’ve never seen it. No one has it that I’m aware of it. The New York Times has investigated this exhaustively, they didn’t find any of your former staff members who were able to corroborate the details of this allegation. I’m prepared to do that, to the best of my knowledge there has been no complaints made against me in terms of my Senate career, in terms of my office and [inaudible 00:03:40] been run. Look, this is an open book. There’s nothing for me to hide, nothing at all. You were unequivocal, Mr. Vice President back in 2018 during the Kavanaugh controversy and hearings and you said that women should be believed. You said this, “For a woman to come forward in the glaring lights of focus nationally, you’ve got to start off with the presumption that at least the essence of what she is talking about is real. Whether or not she forgets the facts, whether or not it’s been made worse or better over time.” She’s going to be going on national television on Sunday, Tara Reade is coming forward in the glaring lights, to use your words, should we not start off with the presumption that the essence of what she’s talking about is real? She says you sexually assaulted her. Look from the very beginning, I’ve said, believing women means taking the woman’s claim seriously when she steps forward and then vet it. Look into it. That’s true in this case as well, women have a right to be heard and the pressure to rigorously investigate claims they make. I will always uphold that principle, but in the end, in every case, the truth is what matters. And in this case, the truth is the claims are false. There is no NDA signed and I’ve never asked anybody to sign an NDA, there are no NDAs period, in my case, none. Your Senate documents at the University of Delaware were supposed to go public and then they were resealed, the access was changed. Well, they weren’t supposed to be revealed. I gave them the university. The university said it’s going to take them time to go through all the boxes. They said it wouldn’t be… and that wouldn’t be before 2020, that that occurred or 2021 I can’t remember the year they said, but look, a record like this can only be in one place. It would not be at the University of Delaware, my archives do not contain personal files. My archives contain document… And when I say personal, personnel files, they don’t contain any personnel files. They are public records, my speeches, my papers, my position papers, and if that document existed, it would be stored in the National Archives were documents from the office she claims to have filed a complaint with are stored, that’s where they are stored. The Senate controls those archives, so I’m asking the Secretary of the Senate today to identify whether any such document exists, if it does make it public. Right, but there are claims and concerns and reports in Business Insider, and she claims that possibly a complaint or some sort of record of this might be at the University of Delaware. First of all, let’s get this straight, there are no personnel documents, but you can’t do that. For example, if you worked with me or I worked for you and you had my income tax returns, you had my whatever, they’re private documents. They don’t get put out in the public, there not part of the public record, that in fact is that any Senator or Vice President or President has in their documents. Look, there was one place that she could file the complaint and that office at the time was all those records from that office are in the archives and they’re controlled by the Senate. That’s where personnel documents would be if they exist. That’s where the complaint would be if it exists. I’m not going to question her motive. I’m not going to get into that at all. I don’t know why she’s saying this. I don’t know why after 27 years, all of a sudden this gets raised. I don’t understand it, but I’m not going to go in and question her motive. I’m not going to attack her. She has a right to say whatever she wants to say, but I have a right to say, “Look at the facts, check it out. Find out whether any of what she says is asserted or true.” And based on the investigations that have taken place so far, to the best of my knowledge by two major papers, they interviewed dozens of my staff members, not just senior staff, but staff members, I’m told at least that’s what they said and nobody, this was not the atmosphere in my office at all. No one has ever said anything like this. But Mr. Vice President, as it pertained to Dr. Ford, everyone wanted… High level Democrats said she should be believed, that they believed it happened. You said if someone like Dr. Ford were to come out, the essence of what she is saying has to be believed, has to be real. Why is it real for Dr. Because the facts are…. Look, I’m not suggesting she had no right to come forward and I’m not saying any woman, they should come forward, they should be heard and then it should be investigated, it should be investigated. And if there’s anything that is consistent with what’s being said and she makes the case or the case is made, then it should be believed. But ultimately the truth matters, the truth matters, it’s period. I fought my entire life to change the whole notion of the law and the culture around sexual assault, and I fought to strengthen and protect the process for survivors. I believe that we’ve come a long way and we have a long way to go in this system before we in fact are in a position that there’s a fair and unbiased view, but at the end of the day, it has to be looked at. These claims are not true. I mean, they’re not true. Mr. I don’t know what else I can say to you. Well, I’m going to try and ask many different ways. Stacey Abrams said during the Kavanaugh hearings, “I believe women, I believe survivors of assault should be supported and their voice’s heard.” Kirsten Gillibrand tweeted, “Do we believe women, do we give them the opportunity to tell their story? We must be a country that says yes every time.” They now both support you. Nancy Pelosi falls into this category too, as well as many other leaders in the democratic party. Look, women are to be believed, given the benefit of the doubt. If they come forward and say something that they said happened to them, they should start off with the presumption they’re telling the truth. Then you have to look at the circumstances and the facts, and the facts in this case do not exist. They never happened. And there’s so many inconsistencies in what has been said in this case. So yes, look at the facts and I assure you it did not happen period, period. What I said during the Kavanaugh hearings was that she had a right to be heard and the fact that she came forward, the presumption would be she’s telling the truth unless it’s proved she wasn’t telling the truth, or not proved, unless it’s clear by the facts surrounding it, it’s not the truth. Look this is a very… I’m sorry. Go ahead. Please. No, no [crosstalk 00:12:29]. I am absolutely positive that no one that I’m aware of ever was been made aware of any complaint, a formal complaint made by or a complaint by Tara Reade against me at the time, this allegedly happened 27 years ago or until, well, I guess it was in April or May of this year. I know of no one who’s aware that any complaint was made. Okay, please. Go ahead. No, no that’s it. Look, the fact is that there’s a lot of things, of speeches I’ve made, positions I’ve taken, interviews that I did overseas with people, all of those things relating to my job and the idea that they would all be made public in the fact while I was running for public office, they could be really taken out of context. Their papers or position papers, they are documents that existed that, that when I… For example, when I met with Putin or when I met with whomever and all of that to be fodder in a campaign at this time, I don’t know of anybody who’s done anything like that. And so the National Archives is the only place there would be anything having to do with personnel records. There are no personnel records in the Biden papers at the university. I am absolutely certain. Yes, and reveal anything that might be related to Tara Reade in the University of Delaware records. There is nothing, they’re not there. I don’t understand the point you’re trying to make. There are no personnel records by definition. The point I’m trying to make is that you are approving and actually calling for a search of the National Archives records of anything pertaining to Tara Reade. Yes. I’m asking why not do the same in the University of Delaware records, which have raised questions because they were supposed to be revealed to the public and then they were sealed for a longer period of time. Because the material in the University of Delaware has no personnel files but it does have a lot of confidential conversations that I had with the President about a particular issue that I had with the heads of state of other places that that would not be something that would be revealed while I was in public office or while I was seeking public office. It just stands to reason, to the best of my knowledge, no one else has done that either. I’m just talking about her name, not anybody else in those records a search for that. Nothing classified with the president or anybody else. The University of Delaware, perhaps you set up a commission that can do it. I don’t know, whatever is the fairest way to create the most transparency. Well, this is… Look, Mika, she said she filed a report. She has her employment records still. She said she refiled a report with the only office that would have a report in the United States Senate at the time. If the report was ever filed, it was filed there, period. This never ever happened. I don’t know what is motivating her. I don’t know what’s behind any of it, but it’s irrelevant. It never happened. It never happened, period. I’m not going to start questioning her motive, I’m not going to get into that. I’m not going to start… I’m not going to go after Tara Reade for saying these things. It’s simple, what are the facts? Do any of the things she said, do they add up? It never happened. Mr. Vice President, stay with us. We’re going to take a one minute break and then Joe and Willie will join with questions on other news of the day. We’re back with the former Vice President Joe Biden in one minute."
"72","05-07-20"," … in [inaudible 00:00:01]. It really is an honor for me to have the opportunity to introduce the next President of the United States. Some four years ago, I had the opportunity to communicate with his brother Frank. Frank and I are very good friends. We spent a lot of time together. I told Frank, I said, “Frank, I would like for you to tell your brother that I want him to run for President of the United States.” Frank smiled right in my office and said, “You know, Al, that is going to happen.” You see, now it’s a reality. I want to thank the Vice President for all he did to get Obama elected and also to come out with a bold plan to face black America, lift every voice, which is really absolutely great, to advance economic priority among African-Americans to expand access to top quality education, to invest in health care disparities. The ACA is what has been very good for us. We have called for it for the last couple of years to make sure that they don’t kill it in Congress. And it’s stretching the juvenile justice system, which is so important, critically important [inaudible 00:01:18] vision. Address [inaudible 00:01:22] justice, which is so important to our communities and to make our voices heard, and protection African-American opportunity to vote. I say simply, they don’t make them like Joe anymore. Joe is the type of person that we need, that as I traveled across the world to find out where America stand, it is going down since their administration. We need someone that not only is [inaudible 00:01:58] about international issues, but also care about America, especially as we go through this pandemic. There was no other person that I know of, even during the course of all of these debates, that can do more to [inaudible 00:02:11] America image to the world and to help the African-American community. No one can do it like Joe. It is my real honor today to have the opportunity to introduce the next President of United States, Joe Biden. Al, thanks an awful lot, Congressman. I really appreciate it, and we now know who to blame for getting me involved with this the first place. But anyway, Al, thanks for being such a good friend. Hi everyone. It’s great to be connected with you all, and Al for being there right from the beginning. Actually before I even got there, you were there, and the way you serve the people of the fifth district, they should be proud, as I’m sure they are. And I want to thank you, Audrey, for your leadership finding for Jacksonville families in the Florida Senate. And by the way, I think we can win back the Florida Senate this time. Before I begin, I know that we have been inundated with tragedies these past several months, but I want to address one particular tragedy, a grave injustice that claimed a life, but that resonates in so many ways across the threads of our history into the present day. By now, many of us have seen that harrowing footage of Ahmaud Arbery on a jog on a beautiful day in February in Florida, I mean, Georgia, shot down in cold blood. A [inaudible 00:03:35] lynch before our very eyes, 2020 style, when so plainly, unmistakenly without mercy. He would have turned 26 years old tomorrow, tomorrow, and his family and the country deserve justice, and they deserve it now, and they deserve a swift, full, and transparent investigation of this brutal murder. But our nation deserves it, as well. We need to reckon with this. This goes on, these vicious acts call to mind the darkest chapters of our history, and more recently the awful specter of white supremacists on the march in Charlottesville, Virginia. A massacres in house of worship, a rising pandemic of hate. When I announced I said I was running to restore the soul American. Well, you know Ahmaud should be alive today. We have no recourse. We have no recourse for the life he lost, but we can make this promise and do it together, and I’m committed, recommit American equal justice, but this time to root out racial inequities, gender inequities, income based inequities, all within our system is still the African-American mothers and fathers should feel confident that their children are safe walking on the streets in America. Until we get there, work remains urgent and unfinished. This is the promise I make to y’all and to everybody across America. As President, I will work tirelessly, tirelessly to get us to that day. Look, I know this is an anxious, difficult moment for our communities, for our nation, and quite frankly for the world. I hope that all of you, your families, your constituents, and members are staying safe and healthy as we take this on. You know, you more than most have been on the front lines of this crisis. You’ve seen the devastating impact every single day. Americans are seeing what leadership looks like, not from their federal government or from you, from you. And I want to commend you for the example you’re setting for service, a public leadership, civic leadership, moral leadership. Tragically, we’ve all seen, and I’ve been speaking about this, every chance I get, that the impact of this crisis on African-American communities is disproportionately heavy, as the Senator pointed out. Six times more people dying in the African-American community, three to four times more people in the African-American community getting sick. African-American workers are losing their jobs as I point out at a higher rate than white workers. This disease is magnifying some of the worst systemic inequities, wrenching those gaps even wider. And it’s shining a bright light on the structural racism that plagues our lives, plagues our laws, our institutions, and our culture. We need an overwhelming moral response to right the wrong, to heal the fissures in our society, to close these gaps, not only to get us through this crisis, but to resurrect America, restore its soul, like where it’s never been in a way that reflects our values. That idea is the heart of my campaign, and this week released a comprehensive agenda for black America. A plan that seeks to create equality and rip out the roots of systemic racism working across a wide range of policy areas to ensure that black Americans are fully dealt in on the economy and society that emerges from this moment on. I hope we’ll all get a chance to read our plan. I know you know it inside and out. Help us pursue that goal. I know you have some questions for me. I’ll just say thank you for all that you’re doing to lead with dignity. Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me today. A concluding comment before we get into questions. You know, how I think that the blinders have sort of ripped off the American public. They’re now seen exactly, without having thought about it before, many of them, not because they are prejudiced or don’t care. They just didn’t know, a lot of them. And now they’re finding out that the people are saving their lives and their family’s lives are hard working people, many of them, a significant number of them, minorities and minority black, primarily, and so I think they’re ready for some real change. America’s the only nation in the world that when we’ve gone through a major crisis, we’ve almost always been able to come get through it and come out stronger. I’m hopeful. I’m going to need you if we win. I’m going to need you to help this time rebuild the backbone of this country, the middle class, but this time bring everybody along regardless of color, sexual preference, their backgrounds, whether they have any … Just bring everybody along. We can do this. We can, and I think the country’s ready. But I’m talking too much. I apologize. I get a little wound up in this, because I feel strongly about it. I know you do, too. So I’m open for your questions. Thank you so much, Mr. Vice President, for your powerful words, comments, and thoughts at such a time as this. And yes, some of our guests do have questions for you, and we’re going to start with Reverend Marvin C. Zanders, II, pastor St. Paul AME Church. Thank you, Senator. Mr. Vice President, thank you. The question I have for you today deals with some of the issues you talked about. However, during the primaries and in many debates with other democratic candidates, there were two sides to the healthcare debate building on the ACA or Medicare for all. Well, Rev, I’ve been working with those folks who are Medicare for all, including Bernie, who’s been a great friend and has endorsed me, and we’re working together. Look, what unites us as Democrats is we all believe that healthcare should be a right, not a privilege. … not a privilege. This year’s Presidential field was the most diverse and dynamic in our history. Full of good ideas and good people. Senators Sanders and Warren, we’re all on the same page. Obamacare was the biggest, most progressive expansion over the four years of our healthcare system. Matter of fact, it’s the biggest expansion in our history. It covered 20 million uninsured Americans, protects 100 million more with preexisting conditions who couldn’t get covered before … Many of which of them are put them at a higher risk of the COVID complications I might add … Stops insurance companies from imposing annual lifetime caps on care, lets young adults stay on their parents’ plan until age 26. This week, Trump and Republican Attorneys General are once again in court trying to overturn Obamacare. Wipe it out. Can you believe that? In the middle of this crisis, during a global pandemic, they’re trying to overturn the ACA and strip millions of Americans of health insurance. They should drop that lawsuit today, and Trump should reopen Obamacare enrollment so every American can access coverage today when they need it the most. Look, my plan is to protect and build on Obamacare with a Medicare lite public option. It’s an ambitious plan. It costs about three quarters of a trillion dollars, $750 billion over 10 years, but we can get it done without raising taxes on the middle class. It will reduce premiums and deductibles and drug costs. It will lower Medicare eligibility to the age of 60, expanding options for older Americans. It will double funding for community health centers on the front lines of care. Will automatically enroll people eligible for Medicaid who live in a state like Florida that’s rejected Medicaid expansion. If you’re eligible, you’ll be automatically enrolled in the Medicare option. That’s even more important now in the midst of this health crisis. That’s why I’ve called for immediately making all COVID testing treatment and any future vaccine free. Free. Whether you have insurance or not. No one should have to pay a dollar out of pocket for it. So to everyone who backed Medicare For All, please join us. So much is [inaudible 00:12:33]. We can get this done quickly. In November healthcare is on the ballot. It’s on the ballot and if you elect me, we can get it done quickly and immediately, and we can get it done in a way that expands to all Americans. Thank you, Mr. Vice President. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Vice President. Next we have Jaylen Geist who is a graduating high school senior. Hi Jaylen. Hi. Well, Jaylen, my wife, who’s a teacher and have been for an educator for a long time, says any country that out educates us, will out compete us. 12 years of education in the 21st century is no longer sufficient. Six out of 10 jobs require more than a high school diploma right now, and the student debt crisis has been festering much too long. Today’s economic crisis makes it even more urgent than ever. So we have to refuse to let it overwhelm your generation and the generation before you and rob you of your future that you’ve been working so hard to get to. First, I’ve called on Congress to immediately forgive $10,000 a person in federal student loans right now. You don’t have to worry about. Payments during the global pandemic should not be on anybody’s mind. When I’m President I’ll make sure that we forgive all tuition-related debt to any public college graduate who’s earning less than $125,000 a year. That means if you went to a public college or university or an HBCU or other minority serving institution and you earn less than $125,000 a year, your loans will be forgiven. We also make community college and trade schools free for everyone. Make public colleges and universities free for families earning less than $125,000. We double the amount of Pell grants. You know what a Pell grant is. You make less than $50,000, lower income students can get the grant. It’s now $6,000, we move it to $12,000 to get more help if they want to go to a private college instead. Many middle class families qualify for the first time. Look, my wife teaches at a community college in Virginia and has all during our tenure as Vice President. She points out that even if you make public community colleges free, a number of people can still can’t afford the food, the transportation, and sometimes the lodging. So here’s the other thing. If you go into public service after you graduate, we forgive $10,000 a year for five years, no matter where you went to [inaudible 00:15:28]. If you’re in a public service 10 years, all your debt is forgiven. And finally, I am a political product of Delaware State University, a great HBCU. I invest $70 billion in HBCUs and minority serving institutions, including the tuition assistance, research and innovation centers, and job placement. This is the way we can begin to straighten out that curve that is bent so badly for African-Americans. The average African-American graduating from college ends up with a debt close to $30,000. It’s putting everybody behind the eight ball. The generation you’re part of now finds himself in a real stuff spot just like the generation in the last 10 years have. You’re going to be graduating, going to school when it’s hard to get money. You’re going to school and it’s hard to even borrow the money. You’re going to school at a time when you get out, the jobs are going to be harder to get because of this God-awful pandemic the President didn’t pay attention to. I promise you it’s a high priority for me. We can get this done. The public now understands it. It’s overwhelmingly in our interest to do it as a nation. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you Mr. Vice President. We now have Dr. Rogers Cain, a primary physician. Dr. Hello Mr. Vice President. Hello doc. Dr. Well, let me start by saying doc, that we in the Obama-Biden Administration, we had gone through two potential pandemics. They were stopped in their tracks basically. We said, we know more were coming. There are going to be more after this as you know, doc. This is not the only potential disease out there that does not honor any borders. You can’t build a wall high enough to keep these diseases out. So this disease is not only tearing through the nation, devastating families, wrecking the economy, it’s magnifying and exacerbating some of the worst systematic inequities exist. Counties with majority Black populations have COVID infections three times higher than majority white counties. Death rates nearly six times higher. Now that’s inconceivable. It should never happen, but we know exactly why it has. People of color are less likely to have access to healthcare and health insurance. Therefore, they’re less likely to go in for preventative efforts. They’re less likely to have had treatment for underlying conditions that make them much more vulnerable to the virus now. And they’re more likely to be exposed to pollutants tied to higher COVID death rates. Less likely to have a job they can just do from home, meaning they’re more likely to have to choose between their lives and their livelihoods. Like so many other public health crises, doc as you know, including climate change and maternal mortality rates, this virus is shining a very bright light on structural racism that still plagues our institutions and our culture. As President, I’ll work for health equity, not just universal healthcare. As I said earlier, I’ll protect Obamacare and build out with a public option. Double funding for community health centers. Automatically enroll people eligible for Medicaid in states that rejected Medicaid expansion. I’ll work to reduce the unconscionable maternal mortality rates, especially women of color, by taking California’s successful approach nationally. I’ll make sure that no American gets sick from the air and drinking water in the neighborhoods where I live, which by the way are primarily, if I can, as they used to say in the Senate, a point of personal preference. When I was a kid and coal died in Scranton when I was in third grade, my dad didn’t have a job. We moved to Delaware. We moved to a little town called Claymont, Delaware. Claymont, Delaware is right on the … That’s that little arc that goes up into Pennsylvania. It’s right there on the line, and it’s right where the largest number of refineries per square mile are, including Houston, of anywhere in the country. … the country. I remember as a kid we’d get in the car, my mom would drop us off at school, which was about a mile away. If it was a time when there was frost on the windshield or a little dew, she’d put on the windshield wipers and there’d be an oil, I’m not joking, because of the pollutants coming across the border, the prevailing winds were southwest, or Southeast and it caused enormous amounts of asthma, very high cancer rates. I’m one of those kids who got the asthma, high cancer rates. I’m going to double the investment in water infrastructure, monitor for contaminants, hold polluters accountable, including sending executives to jail when they know what’s happening and they’ve done nothing about it, restore scores of environmental protections gutted by the president, because we can do this. The people who are hurt the most are not, no surprise again, Doc, you know it, the people who are coming to see you, many of them come from neighborhoods where they’re much lower income, zip codes are not as prestigious and that’s where most of the pollutants are. That’s where the businesses are. That’s where things are, stuff is being left in the aquifer and the light. There’s a lot we can do and it has to do with the whole notion of cleaning up the environment where particularly minorities live and that includes going to their schools. I’m going to invest a trillion dollars over this period of time, not a joke, in cleaning up our schools. Do you know how many schools out there, Doc, you can’t go to a water fountain and trust a kid can get a drink out of the water fountain without a pollutant or there’s still asbestos or some contaminant in the air, or they have heating or cooling systems that aren’t safe? We have to invest in our children. We have to invest in these communities. By the way, it’s not just the morally right thing to do to help the people that are being hurt the most, and African-Americans are being hurt the most by this because of where they live, it also is overwhelming the interest of all the public. All the public, no matter what neighborhood you live in, that we clean this up. A lot more to say, Doc, but thank you for what you do, Doc. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Vice President. I really appreciate that answer. That was a great answer. Sorry, I get a little wound up with this. No, I’m fine. I’m fine. [crosstalk 00:22:31] we can do. I really mean, I believe it. Anyway, sorry. Thank you. Thank you Mr. Vice President. For our final question, we will go to Veronica Ward, a small business owner. Thank you, Senator. Thank you, Mr. Vice President. Hey, Veronica. Hi. Absolutely. Positively. Look what the big corporations make it try to think is they’re the ones who provide most employment. Small businesses are the foundation of a community, of this country, the access to the American Dream and they’re bearing the brunt of this crisis today and they never have gotten a fair share, particularly small business run by people of color. Even before COVID-19, the basic bargain was broken. Far too many small businesses and working people of color, the Trump economy was far from booming for those folks and for you. 13% of Americans are African-American or black, just 4% of business owners are African-American. The growing body of evidence suggests that after a disaster like COVID, recovery funding often, very often, just widens the racial gap and disparity even more. We can’t let this new crisis make things worse. We have to take advantage of it. I released a plan for black America this week including steps to make sure this epidemic is moved into a positive, our economic recovery isn’t just equitable and benefits everyone, especially those who are left behind. Let me give you a couple of examples here. As president, I’ll make sure economic relief reaches black-owned businesses. The first round of stimulus funding left out African-Americans. An estimated 90% of minority-owned businesses did not receive the loans that are guaranteed, banks aren’t doing you any favor, are guaranteed by the treasury. A federal guarantee. There’s a second round now that targets 60 billion for community banks and that disproportionately serve communities of color because the big banks weren’t even, unless you added an account with them, unless you had a credit card with them, et cetera, you didn’t even get to the window and you were supposed to get the bulk of the money. I say you in an editorial sense. A good start is the new effort, but we need to do much more. First of all, I’ll reserve half of all new Payroll protection Funds for small businesses with less than 50 employees, that’s 98% of all minority and women-owned businesses. I’ll make non-profits like African-American churches eligible as well. I’ll also keep a close eye on the distribution of that relief. Any jurisdiction that gets stimulus funding should be required to track and release the data on potential racial disparities. You may recall, ma’am, I’m the one that called for and pointed out the disparities that were occurring in terms of the failure of the loans to get to the people they were intended to in this crisis. The treasury and the small business administration should be, and in my administration they will, tracking lending. Tracking it and making it public and transparent to eliminate barriers to credit and capital for minority business owners. I’ll make sure we get much more capital flowing to the community long term. Here’s what I’m going to do. I’m going to double the funding of the Obama/Biden small business credit initiative, drawing as much as $30 billion of private equity off the sidelines. We had at one point a $5 billion program. If we make that a $3 billion program just for small minority businesses and manufacturers, more than 40% are owned by women and people of color. I’m going to expand what we call the market tax credit, new market tax credit, doubling funding for community development financial institutions. Fancy phrase. But the reason is, you know as well as I do, when a small business like yours or small businesses in the community are open and running and prospering, the whole community is lifted up, the whole community. There’s evidence to suggest that black entrepreneurs are just as successful, just as successful, as white entrepreneurs. There is no rationale not to be able to get the money to keep a business open and to start a new one. I’m about building equity. A lot more to talk about. I hope you take a look at the plan because I think the major way in which Americans generate wealth in the middle class is equity in their homes. Look how hard it is for African-Americans today to get into a home. That’s why I provide for $15,000 first term tax credit for everybody buying a new home. It gets written off. That’s why I make sure that we’re going to do a lot to significantly increase the availability of government-financed housing so that no one ever pays more than 30% of our income for the rent, et cetera. There’s a lot we can do. The concluding comment I want to make is, and I keep making this. I make it to the chamber of commerces of the world, the business guys. I said, “Look, man, this isn’t just about helping people who deserve to be treated with equity like everybody else’s treated, it also is overwhelmingly the interest of big companies, overwhelmingly the interests of wealthy people, overwhelmingly the interest of everybody if everybody does better. Nobody gets hurt when you raise the bottom. People are busting their necks, they’re busting their necks, and they deserve to be treated with dignity. This is all about being treated with dignity. How can you maintain your dignity as a parent when you can’t afford to provide for healthcare for your child or when there’s an insurance that can say, “I’m cutting off funding. You’ve outrun your insurance.” When my son was dying, when he came home from Iraq, over terminal cancer, I can’t imagine what would have happened had we not had Obamacare and they were able to come along and say, “By the way, you have now run out of coverage. Suffer the last five months of your life on your own. Look, it’s about dignity. It’s about dignity, and everybody deserves to be treated with dignity. That’s what our economic program should be based on: Is it delivering to the American people the opportunity to maintain their dignity? That’s what it should be. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Vice President. Senator, thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Vice president. Thank you so much for your passion. You never have to suppress that. … Passion, you never have to suppress that is very much appreciated. And I want to also think all of those who participated today and the discussion, which was very lively, honest and upfront and laid out the plan that a president Joe Biden would have for the African-American community. And before I ask Congressman Lawson to close us out, I want to go back to the vice president to see if he has any closing remarks. Well first of all, it’s great to be in Jacksonville today and look, I’m anxious to get down in person, campaign in person with you all. There’s so much I believe we can do. The president has wasted so much time taking on this terrible crisis we have right now. It’s costing lives. We’ve got to change it. I’m convinced that if, in fact, we will get through this because the American people are tough, but I’m also convinced the American people now understand much more clearly what is at stake and how many people they had to rely on, who as you said earlier, couldn’t stay home and had to go to work. The people who are the nurses, the people are the orderlies, the people who sanitize the operating rooms, the people who, the first responders, the people who in fact keep the grocery stores open, drive the mail truck, make sure they get product to market, working in the field. They’re all of a sudden realizing, I always say Wall Street didn’t build this country. Ordinary hardworking Americans given half a chance built the country, and we’ve got to … Now the country’s understanding, even those people who didn’t look at it before, what we have to do and I’m convinced we can do it. I’m looking forward to doing it in person with you all. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much mister vice president. Thank you very, very much. And now to Congressman Lawson to close. I thank you very much Leta. I’m honored to be able to work for you. [inaudible 00:32:21] that I’ve served in Congress and seeing that from the time I got there, everything that you all did through you all administration [inaudible 00:02:28], which has meant so much to so many people and so many people have been involved in it. I can tell you this. We have to get rid of Donald Trump for the White House. He destroyed America, he divided people across this country, he divided people among racial lines. I know from my experience working with you all before, how important it is of all the things that you all want to do and lifting every voice. It’s what America needs, what African-Americans needs, where we can get united. There’s no way that we can let America be divided the way it is. They knew in January that his pandemic was coming and nothing happened. They called it like it was the flu and now we see that so many people that have lost their lives to something that they have no knowledge of. I know under your administration that would never happen because I knew what you all put in place and what has happened before and all the lives you saved before. I am so honored to have the opportunity to work for you across America to make sure that you will be the next president of United States of America. Thank you, Sarah, for all your hard work. Be safe and may God bless all of you on this call today. [inaudible 00:03:51], when I got elected, my door’s going to remain open. I’m going to do this when I’m president as well, and my door’s always open, as you well know, it’s open to you and the entire caucus. It’s just going to be open. We have to keep the American people at the center of everything we do, and that’s not happening now. Thank you."
"73","05-14-20"," Thank you for joining this Biden For President event. We’d like to thank our guests, Governor Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Governor Phil Murphy of New Jersey, and Governor Ned Lamont of Connecticut. Now please welcome Vice President Joe Biden. Hey, thank you all for joining me today. And I don’t want to take too much time here at the top because you’ll want people to hear directly from you guys. You’re living it every day. You’re making the really tough decisions on the ground every day. You’ve been doing it from day one. And there are a lot of as you know better than I do, there’re a lot of scared people in this country, all across the country who are looking for leadership and clear guidance. And, so often it’s all of you that they’re looking to. This is not a partisan statement, governors, mayors, local leaders, you’re all stepping up all across the country. Republicans and Democrats alike filling the vacuum of leadership that I believe the federal government should be having your backs. It hasn’t done it enough. And it should be fighting like hell to get your States the PPE and the test and the funding that you so desperately need to keep your economies going. And this is not a moment for excuses, or deflections, or a blame game. We’re in the middle of a pandemic that has cost us more than 85,000 jobs, as of today. Lives of millions of people, millions of people, millions of jobs. And we’re in a position where we just got new unemployment insurance, this morning, numbers. 36.5 million claims since this crisis began. And almost 3 million new claims in the last week. Unemployment rate is nearing 15%, the highest has been since the great depression. But I need not tell you all that. Of course, it’s the least well off who are being hit the hardest, 40% of the households making $40,000 or less experienced a job loss, just in March. We’re going to have to work harder and smarter than ever before to pull ourselves out of this economic tailspin. But, I know what all of you know. That the only way out of this is by following the science, listening to the experts, talking and taking responsible precautions that is going to help us reopen the economy as safely and as quickly as possible. And as we do, there’s got to be federal support to state and local levels of our government, in my view, so that we’d be able to come out of this crisis stronger and more united. We have an opportunity, in my view, to transform the economy as we come out to build a more inclusive and more resilient middle class. And that can withstand the next public crisis, whatever it is, however it comes about. Not just reward the people who are well off and well connected. It’s time for us to be sure everyone gets a fair shot at success in this country. I know you all stand for that. We got a lot of ground to cover. So let’s start with this, know that the virus can hit anyone [inaudible 00:04:55]. But it doesn’t affect every community the same. It hits the most vulnerable, the least resourced the hardest. And Governor Whitmer, I know that you’ve created a Michigan Coronavirus Task Force on racial disparities to address the disproportionate impact the virus is having on communities of color. What have we learned? I found it both stunning and heartbreaking, Black populations have the Coronavirus infections at three times the rate higher than white [inaudible 00:05:29]. Death rates are nearly six times as high. But I really applaud your leadership in this issue. Because, I can tell you… What are you focusing on? Can you [inaudible 00:05:42] a little bit about the work your taskforce is doing and what you found both in scope of the challenge and the potential ways to address it? Because, it’s not just in Michigan. Sure. I’m happy [inaudible 00:05:57]. Thank you very much Mr. Vice President. I’m glad to be here with Governors Murphy and Lamont. This is [inaudible 00:06:01] One of the great things that I have found I’m in the midst of this crisis is that I’ve been able to reach out and get counsel from my fellow Governors, working together to try to address the issues that we’re confronting in our States across this country. And, tell the story about what’s happening here in Michigan. Now this week I lost another dear friend of mine to COVID-19. He was on a ventilator for weeks on end. He was a champion on behalf of the people of Detroit and the legislature. He passed away two days ago and it’s heartbreaking. Michigan has been one of the hardest hit states in the fight against COVID-19. [inaudible 00:06:39] been aggressively fighting. My team and I have been working around the clock to do a number of things to ensure people have the support they need. We’ve banned evictions and foreclosures so people can stay in their homes. We’ve expanded unemployment benefits to help working people put food on the table when they’re out of [inaudible 00:07:00]. And we’ve expanded access to childcare for our frontline workers. We’re still working hard to [inaudible 00:07:06] Michiganders [inaudible 00:07:07] spread of this virus. And there is a real threat of what could be the second wave that would dwarf the experience we’ve had thus far. We don’t want the sacrifice we’ve made to have been made the vain. And that’s why we’ve got to be really smart. We’ve ramped up our testing abilities, working with a number of businesses like CVS and Walgreens and Rite Aid to launch drive through testing sites across the state. We’ve worked with nearly all of the state’s health insurance companies to waive cost sharing, including copays deductibles and coinsurance for COVID-19 testing and treatment. And we’re testing more and more people every single day. Our percentage of positive cases has gone down. This past Sunday we were at just 6% positive cases, which is the lowest percent we’ve had since the onset of those first cases March 10th. The day after you were here in Michigan with me was the first day we got our two cases. And this was the lowest we’ve been since that, almost six weeks ago. We’ve still got a lot of work to do though, and there’s no question that we need help from the federal government. The issue around racial disparities is one that we have seen play out. And Michigan was one of the first States to release data around people’s rates. We’ve seen it in Illinois and Louisiana. But here in Michigan, 14% of our population is African American, and yet over 40% of our COVID-19 deaths are African Americans here in Michigan. And the virus is just simply holding up a mirror to our country to the disparate outcomes for people of color in America, generally. And reminding us about these deep inequities. From the basic lack of access to healthcare, to the access to transportation, to lack of protections in the workplace. So the fact that our front line, the people that are our essential workforce, is often disproportionately people of color. These inequities hit people of color and the vulnerable communities the hardest. So that’s why we created this Task Force around racial disparities. It’s chaired by my Lieutenant Governor Garlin Gilchrist, who’s the first African American Lieutenant Governor in Michigan history. And they’re going to provide recommendations on how to address racial disparities I this moment, but also, a plan for going forward. We’ve been focused on attacking implicit bias and expanding healthcare, but we know that there’s a lot more to learn in this moment. That’s why we’re going to continue to see this through, not just through the other side of COVID-19, but to inform a policy agenda that really creates equitable outcomes and equitable opportunity for people. We’ve also created something called the Futures for Frontliners which is kind of like the GI Bill. Is to give an opportunity to people who’ve been on the front lines. If they want to add [inaudible 00:10:00] school and some additional skills. We want to make sure that they know how grateful we are that they kept stocking the shelves in the grocery store, or showing up when we’re in trouble, whether it’s at the hospital or in an emergency. We need to do right by the people that have made such a sacrifice on all of our behalf. It’s been a tough eight weeks, but we are seeing that we’re making a difference. All of these aggressive actions are starting to pay off, but we are nowhere out of the woods yet. And we’ve got a lot more work to do, and we need to make sure that we’ve got real partnership. This is not a political issue. I agree. This is not a partisan issue, the enemy is the virus. You’d expect me to say this, I know, because I think you’re such a good Governor. But I think you’ve done one hell of a job. One of the things I hope, and maybe we can talk about this later when we come out of this, I hope we can deal with some of the institutional inequities that exists. Because, we’re one of the few nations that every major crisis we’ve faced in our history has been in the situation where we have come out stronger. Come out stronger. What I’m finding, and maybe we can go back to this later, but I’m finding that this whole crisis has sort of taken the blinders off and most people. The people who weren’t necessarily prejudice, but just didn’t focus. That’s the geese you hear in the background, there’s a little pond out here. Those Canadian geese are trying to get away from the virus. Anyway, all kidding aside. What I’m finding, people who are constantly calling me… And I know we’re all in place, but we have on the phone probably six hours a day. People are talking about how they didn’t realize that it was somebody making seven bucks an hour had their back and made sure that they still had food. [inaudible 00:11:58] that person driving that delivery truck, the postman. The postman, the person who in fact is a first responder, who is with the local fire department. These are the people who a lot of them are the hourly workers who in fact can’t stay home. They can’t stay home. And they’re the ones risking their lives and they’re the ones losing their lives. But my point is, I think what you’ve set up is important because when I was talking to your mayor in Detroit, who’s an old friend. I spent a lot of time in Detroit trying to get it back on its feet as you recall, is that realizing the disparity in how this virus is affecting minority communities and we started arguing, and I think all of you did, that we should be keeping very detailed records about how and who and where and when the virus is striking. But I think there’s a lot more to talk about in that. I’m sorry to go off on that. Look, Governor Lamont and Murphy, I know that both of you are grappling with the same challenges. What are you seeing [inaudible 00:13:07] states? Whomever, what are the things that people are most concerned about? what are you hearing the most? And what keeps you awake at night? I’d be interested to hear what you put at the top of the list, if you can. Sure. I’ll jump in. Let me just say, Gretchen, it’s great to see you and Phil. I’ve been so proud of the governors on both sides of the aisle, taking the lead on this. And Mr. Vice President, thank you for listening to the governors because we have been on the front line. Something you said and Gretchen said that really resonated with me. You wanted to know we’ve learned. We raised the minimum wage here about a year and a half ago and people were sort dismissively talking about minimum wage or low wage earners. And as you just said and as Gretchen said, look, our first responders, they can’t stay safe, stay at home. We’ve been asking them every day to go in and keep us safe. They’ve gone from being minimum wage workers, I think post-COVID, we now call them essential workers. That’s right. I like to think you’ve understood your whole life, it’s in your core, Mr. Vice President, that work is a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about dignity. And now we realized that that food service worker is actually a key part of the food supply chain and keeping us healthy. You mentioned the importance of the delivery trucks. How about the janitor? Now we realize when they keep your office clean, they are keeping you safe. These are vital pieces of what we try and do. And if we learn anything from this miserable COVID virus, I hope we learn a new respect for a lot of the folks who are doing the work in this country. Listen, first of all, my late mother would say, “As you’re known by the company you keep, what company I’m keeping today.” Mr. Well, thank you. [inaudible 00:15:09] and with Gretchen and Ned who are extraordinary governors, who I look up to and look to so often, and I’m thrilled to be with you. Phil, thank you. Might get you in trouble. Yeah, I know, I know, I know. That’s okay. I’m channeling the spirit of our late friend, Frank Lautenberg. I’m your neighbor to the north as you know. I was talking to Bonnie the other day. Oh, is that right? God bless her and God bless him. Listen, we remain in the thick of it, Mr. Vice President. I know you know that. If you’ll look particularly at per 100,000 residents, so per capita, New Jersey, Connecticut, and New York continue to be sadly in the poll positions on positive tests, hospitalizations, and fatalities. Now the good news is, it’s gotten better. There’s no question about that, but it is still a reality that we’re the densest region in the country and the density of the impact of this virus is unmistakable. So what do we worry about and what keeps me up at least right now, it’s balancing that progress and that thirst to take steps to reopen with the stark reality that this virus is still among us. We had almost 200 people go into the hospital yesterday with COVID-19. We announced 244 fatalities today. And yet, again, the curves that we look at that give us confidence that we can begin to take steps are going in the right direction. So getting that balance right. We opened up county and state parks a week and a half ago, so far so good. I just announced today, and that your reputation is here still our third senator from the good old days, you know the Jersey Shore as well as I do. I do. We made an announcement today under certain restrictions on density and social distancing we’d open our beaches for Memorial Day. And we do that hopefully responsibly. And our mantras are that public health creates economic health, not the other way around and secondly, data determines dates as you said this right up front. If you look at the science, the data, the hard facts, it tends to get you into the right place not with public [inaudible 00:00:17:50]. Getting that balance right, I would say, keeps us up most at night. And I would say, if you gave me two, I would say the other one is the federal government’s direct cash assistance to states. Our costs are going up by the minute, our revenues have fallen off a cliff. I suspect that Gretchen and Ned would be in violent agreement with both of those statements. You know this better than anybody in the country. There’s nothing that can replace the existential role that the federal government can play. We need that direct cash. And that will allow us to keep firefighters, police, educators, healthcare workers, EMS on the payroll, serving the communities at the time when we need it the very most. I’d say to all three of you, I think what most informed voters even, it’s not like they have to be uninformed, I don’t think people realize that the only branch of the government that is able and necessarily has to be able to engage in deficit spending to deal with crisis is the federal government. You all have to balance your budgets. Every time you submit a budget, it has to be in balance. And the loss of revenue has been astounding as a consequence of this virus. And you’ve got a real problem. I remember back in the crisis of 2009, the economic crisis, the financial crisis we had, the president asked me to take over a program where there was a $800 billion of aid that was going to go to state and local governments. Not just that, but to resurrect the economy, to get it back working, to actually begin to rebuild it. And one of the things that I learned right off the bat was had we not provided for tens of hundreds of billions of dollars, you’re in New Jersey as well as Michigan and Connecticut, all across the nation, the number of firefighters you’d have to lay off, the number of teachers should have to lay off, the number of police officers you’d have to lay off, the number of essential workers you’d have to lay off, is staggering. And so I know the majority leader fairly well, Mitch McConnell, and I find it a little disturbing him talking about, well, just declare bankruptcy, is his response, declare bankruptcy. Well, and he’s not going to bail out, why are we bailing out the states? Because guess what? The very people you want to be able to make sure state and local governments will be able to continue to be able to pay and keep on the payroll the people who are carrying the rest of the country on their back right now. I don’t understand what they’re doing, what he and the president are thinking about. But you noticed that the majority, the Speaker of the House and the minority leader in the Senate have proposed a significant amount of money, about $850 billion, for state local aid. And I think it’s necessary. We got to get it out there now. But can I ask you all one more question about this and we’ll move on, but what about the notion that how prepared do you think we are if, God forbid, some of the recommendations that are coming from some scientists that we may see a significant rebound in the fall of this virus? Do you think you have enough stockpile of PPE, enough testing equipment, enough to be able to test and trace? Talk to me about what your concerns are about [inaudible 00:21:37] the very things that you [inaudible 00:21:42] get that you’re going to be, God forbid if this gets as bad as some are predicting in the fall and going into the winter. Maybe I’ll start if that’s all right. Sure. I think what we know is that until there’s a vaccine or a cure, the best tool that we have aside from social distance, which we can’t do it forever, is testing. [inaudible 00:22:16] 1% to 2% of our population every single week, that’s about a 100,000 to 200,000 people here in Michigan every single week. We have the capabilities to continue [inaudible 00:22:27] testing. We’re able to [inaudible 00:22:31] at the trace capabilities to follow up where we’ve got positives. But what we don’t have are some of the critical, simple supplies. Swabs, which is really not a hard thing to manufacture, were predominantly produced in Italy, which of course, was shut down for a long period of time. And each of these types of COVID test use a different type of swab and you can’t just use a Q-tip. It has to be a certain type of swab. And so we’ve gotten some shipments of swabs from the federal government and we are grateful and they have committed to giving us a weekly shipment. However, we were supposed to have a variety of different types of swabs in this most recent shipment because we have a variety of different types of tests and they require different implements. We got a hundred percent of foam swabs. Now we’re grateful for the swabs and I’m not complaining, but that [inaudible 00:23:25] test kits that use a different type of swab we can’t use. And so we’re not going to [inaudible 00:23:30] that 1% to 2% because we’re missing something as simple as a variety of swabs. And I share that with you because I think that there’s a back and forth in the media about whether or not these things exist, they exist, but we need the right representation of them in order to fulfill our testing capabilities. That is the key to opening, reengaging sectors of our economy with confidence. We know where COVID-19 is, that we’re able to pin it down. [inaudible 00:24:00] keep it from having community spread. We didn’t keep it from having community spread, and without those things, it’s really not wise to go too far out there if you’re not able [inaudible 00:24:11] the way. And I think that’s one of the things that I know I’ve talked to JB Pritzker from Illinois. He’s confronting the same thing. Yeah. We have our regional conversation regularly. I don’t know if Phil and Ned I’d have the same experience, but I think that, that’s one of the frustrations. One of my concerns about [inaudible 00:24:28] we’re seeing [inaudible 00:24:29] country is with less testing, we’re not doing it right. Gretchen’s got it exactly right. Look, it took the federal government, it took the White House, to be blunt, a long time to take this seriously, and we were out there on our own. But we’re neighbors here. It was like a surge pricing on [inaudible 00:00:51. they had the PPE. It was coming in from China. Ready to go get that Uber car, bing, off goes the plane again. Phil and I and five other governors, we’ve gotten together. We’re going to purchase as part of a cooperative. Like Gretchen said, like the Christmas trees arriving on December 26, this is going to go on for a while. We’re going to make sure we have a stockpile in place that we needed for this fall, if it comes about. I got to tell you though, I do resent it the idea of a bailout. I heard the phrase mentioned. It was the federal government that stood there and said, it’s time for you to slow down significantly parts of your economy. We slowed them down, and 90% of our budget shortfall is related to the loss of revenues that disappeared, not [inaudible 00:25:38] disappeared. Right now, I [inaudible 00:25:41] an unfunded mandate [inaudible 00:25:43] federal government. I think they have to step up. And if you ever want to get this economy going again, you don’t want these states to be a lodestone on the economy, so I hope Congress does the right thing over the next few weeks. Well, [inaudible 00:25:55] did. Yeah, just briefly. Yeah. [inaudible 00:25:59] council, he and Andrew Cuomo were working morning, noon, and night as we closed our states, and we determined it would be smart if we formalize and added a few more neighbors. [inaudible 00:26:11] announced that we’re opening beaches today. Importantly, we did that in coordination with Delaware, New York, and Connecticut of something that’s really working. It’s no secret that as a nation, and certainly in our state, we did not begin the pandemic with remotely the horsepower and the supplies that we needed. Grateful that we were able to find common ground with the federal administration on testing, and ventilators, and PPE, and bed capacity. Gretchen’s point is a very good one. The state of New Jersey, I just announced today, is distributing [inaudible 00:26:49] two and a half million pieces of PPE. I might add a business line that we weren’t in two and a half months ago to give folks an idea of the volume of stuff that we’re talking about here. The question is, Mr. Vice President, are we prepared for a rebound in the fall or winter? I would say we’re trying to get there. We are literally … We had a team meeting on that literally today in terms of restocking bed capacity, PPEs, ventilators, the volunteer healthcare worker corps that raised their hand to come in and help. We’re not there yet, though. Without question, we’re not there yet. And please, God, we only have to go through this once, that we get there, and we get there preemptively. Well, Gretchen, as you said, we’re not going to be out of it until we have a vaccine. I have, like all of you, but every day I have between an hour and an hour and a half brief with our former surgeon general, anyway, with docs across the country, and they brief me on what they’re anticipating, what they’re seeing, what they’re worried about, and what needs to be done. And testing and tracing are a gigantic part of the answer in the meantime. We’ve been kind of, I say, it’s an exaggeration to say a little slow off the mark. We’ve been way, way, way off the mark in getting that material to you all. That’s the first part of the question. The second question I have, and I’m sorry to keep it so long, but you guys are right there. You know what’s going on. The second part of the question is, the world got together and decided that they were calling an international conference on seeking a vaccine. And we concluded, the President concluded he didn’t want to participate. Because we’re the best in the world, he didn’t want to participate. And so you have what’s going on in London, all across the world now, what I’m a little concerned about is if and when we get a vaccine, we’re going to need literally billions of those shots. We’re going to need to be able to have it available both here in the United States, rural, as well as suburban, as well as inner city, but we’re also going to need it internationally. And so I’ve thought, we have great scientists. I think we have the best in the world. We are working like hell on it here, but one of the things we’re calling for is a significant increase in funding for the ability to produce the vaccine here in the United States if in fact one is found. I want to control the supply chain myself. I don’t want to be sitting around waiting for the national stockpile to decide they can send it to me, or waiting for that plane to land from China any longer. Working with Phil, working with our regional governors here, Gretchen, I assume you’re doing the same, we want to get as much stockpile we can control ourselves. One state makes the vents. Somebody else is really focusing on pharma. Phil’s state is amazing there. Gina Raimondo up in Rhode Island, making mass. I want to make sure next time around, we control our own destiny. Well, one of the things I think you all did, and I’d call for really early on, was the need basically for a supply officer. If this were a military operation, if we’re going to war, you have to know where every weapon, every tank, every missile, every plane is at, and there’s a supply officer. You go to where the need is the greatest, the troops that need the most help. And the best of my knowledge, that doesn’t exist right now. At least for us, it’s been the FEMA administrator more often than not, who’s a northeast guy, by the way, I think Rhode Island native. I want to come back, Mr. Vice President, to the point you made, the sort of public health army. We’re standing up our testing and contact tracing, and Gretchen said it. That’s exactly, in terms of the percentage of our population, we think we’ve got to test every week. So we’ve said we’re going to be at least 20,000 tests a day by the end of this month, 5,000 a day by the end of June. But we also said contact tracing is a big piece of this, so we started with Rutgers School of Public Health, which is going to contribute several hundred folks. This is on top of the county folks who are already doing a really good job of this. But we then said, listen, if you want to sign up to be a contact tracer, go to our main COVID19.nj.gov website/tracing and give us your name. I made that announcement at a press conference Tuesday at one o’clock of this week. The next day, someone asked me, same press conference, same time, how many had signed up, and my colleague told me that in 24 hours, over 21, 000 people had signed up to want to do this, which tells you two things. The spirit of service, not just in our state, but certainly here and around the country, and two, the amount of people who are desperately looking for a job right now. That’s exactly right. We overestimated. Exactly right. Well, in order for you all to effectively carry out your reopening plans to get the economy back on track, to support workers and their families and communities, you need the resources, and I know that the rising costs imposed by the pandemic, declining tax revenues have hit you really, really hard. And like I said, the house has stepped up and said we should be providing state and local funding so you don’t have to make the painful cuts. This isn’t some math exercise. It’s about people. It’s about making sure you don’t have to cut firefighters, teachers, police officers, critical public health programs, or stop work on roads and bridges. Look, we included the Recovery Act in 2009, it being critical to keep all these folks in place. What are you hearing from your mayors and your county executives about the budget cuts that they’re having to make? I’m assuming they’re coming to the state asking for help, and the budget cuts that they’re worried about if Trump and McConnell continue to block this funding. They’re in tough shape. This has already started. That’s the other thing is we talk too often, I’m guilty of this myself, that this is a potential or possible eventuality, which runs the risk of this being abstract. We’ve got right now municipalities laying off firefighters in New Jersey. This is upon us, and the numbers are significant. Our numbers are deep, double digit billions of dollars that we think we need, and if we don’t get it, I think, Mr. That’s right. Right. … health related, unemployment claims filers, et cetera. So it’s real, and it’s upon us. Well, it’s the essential workforce that is still working. I mean, if you look at our budgets, we’re anticipating about a $3 billion shortfall in the current fiscal year. It will be bigger than that in the next fiscal year. All of which are absolutely critical in a global pandemic, where we are confronting this crisis. We’ve got to protect public health. We’ve got to protect public safety, and the education of our kids has already been so compromised. We think the usual learning loss of a summer is tough. We’re going to have real needs to wrap our kids around with the sports so that they can not lose all this time of education where they’re not in the classroom getting it. And so we do, and I think, to Phil’s point, as a group of governors, this is front and center for every single one of us, Democratic and Republican. And we are at the NGA trying to get Congress to take action. We’re grateful for what the House leadership did, but what’s going to happen in the Senate and where the White House is, I think, is the great unknown. And that’s why it’s got to be all hands on deck because these States are full of good people who just simply want government to work, and are desperately relying on these fundamentals that are at risk here if we don’t get this assistance quickly. If I could just add, Mr. Vice president, what makes the education particularly tough is A. the risks that you’re going to have to cut it by 20%. At the same time, we’re probably going to have to shrink the size of our classes, so that there’s some type of social distancing there. We’re going to have to maybe stagger schedules a little bit. Like Gretchen said, this is all coming on the heels of kids who have had their education, to some degree, interrupted. If you can give us a little bit of certainty in terms of what we can plan for and budget for, that will make a world of difference for the future of these kids and our States. Well, I think it’s a gigantic deal. What I’ve been interested to see is the governors that I used to work with in the Senate, like the governor of Ohio and others, a lot of governors are speaking up, Republican governors, and saying, “Hey, Mr. President, we need help. We need the help. It makes sense. And as I said, well, here’s what I’m hopeful of. And maybe I’m just, as one of my doctors said years ago, when I was hospitalized with an aneurysm, they said my problem is I’m a congenital optimist, but I think I am. I think that what’s happening is, all of this is sort of being stripped bare, and people are beginning to see and understand how things work and how they don’t work, and why it’s time to step up. And for example, I think it’s a false choice to say we either deal with employment or we deal with the virus. You can’t separate them. Unless you get the virus under control, unemployment and the economy is going to remain in real trouble. And so, one of the things that I think is important is as we get from stimulus, what we’re talking about now, into recovery, we have an opportunity to really provide for some real changes, economic change. For example, one of the things that we’re finding out all across the country, I’ve been pushing a thing. It’s not about me, but I’ve been pushing the thing for dealing with $20 billion for nationwide broadband. Particularly in rural areas, I worked a lot in your state, Gretchen, about dealing with this because in the peninsula, you got a lot of problems. And so all of a sudden, we’re finding out these parents from families that are not used to having to be concerned about their kids being able to get their education, now that they’re they’re home and they’re supposed to be attending, whether it’s college, graduate school, undergraduate school, high school, grade school, they’re finding they can’t get online. They can’t follow the teachers. They can’t do the classes. And so, I hope I’m not kidding myself. I think we’re going to be able to see some genuine, genuine recovery and creating as we deal with these issues. I think we could create 10 million good paying jobs just by dealing with infrastructure, the environment, and a whole range of things. It’s become clear to us that can be dealt with and employ people in a way that, in fact, is going to make us stronger, rather than weaker. But I’m keeping you a long time. I’m sorry. I’m taking advantage of you. Is there anything, any one of you would like to talk about before we close out, because I know kept you a long time. I’d like to talk about the fact that we needed a congenital optimist in the white house. Mr. Vice President. We’ve learned a lot from this COVID, and we’ve got to start thinking about what we’ve learned that we could turn the corner on. You mentioned the digital divide, and the IT. Look, it’s all been telehealth and telecommuting. Exactly. So Brown V Board of Education said if you can’t get access to the internet and can’t get access to online learning, you lose. We’ve got to expand that. I hope to God healthcare has learned what telehealth is, and we kind of build off of that. I hope we’ve learned a lot about nursing homes, Mr. Vice President, because that’s [crosstalk 00:41:10] going to recast in a big way. We need somebody who can think big in the White House. And I hope we’ve learned a lot about racial disparities and the agenda for America that really creates opportunity and equity. I hope that we have learned to embrace science and hey, let’s translate this into some good work to combat climate change. I mean, I’m hopeful that, in all of this grim reality, that we’re all doing our best to get through on behalf of our people, that we take with this some lessons learned that we can make a stronger United States, where there is opportunity, and that we are leaders on these fronts, because that’s where there is real potential for something positive to come out of this. I would just echo and say, I endorse everything that Ned and Gretchen have just said. In particular, what it would be like to have you in the White House, Mr. Vice President. We need that optimism. We need a plan. We need to make decisions based on data and science. We need to close the inequities Gretchen talked about. Every day, I speak to some loved ones of families who have lost someone to this. I just literally got off the phone just before you and Annie called me, Mr. Vice President with Mrs. Clegg, whose son, Michael, African-American Newark cop, died COVID-19. A healthy guy, 27 years on the service. Again, a proud African American community, a guy who was laying it out every day. We cannot afford, as a nation, to learn these lessons again. We’ve got to learn them now and take the steps we need to close those inequities. I could not agree more. And I’m incredibly honored to be on this conversation with each of you. Well, thanks. But look, folks, it was 85000 people who’ve died. They’re not a number. They left behind entire families and communities. And we all know from our own personal experiences that it’s awful hard to overcome the loss of a son, daughter, mother, father, husband, wife, mom, dad. I mean it takes a long time. The only thing I can tell those folks who have had those losses is that they’re going to stay with you. They’re in your heart. They’re not going to go away. They’re part of you. And the way I’ve focused on it is the way you can deal with it is have a purpose. And the purpose is changing the circumstances that created this circumstance in the first place. And I think there’s an awful lot of people who are willing to do that. To see all those kids out of medical school signing up, all those nurses are showing up. It’s amazing. It’s amazing. I drive you guys crazy over the last year about talking about we have to restore the soul of America. We’re seeing the soul of America. The soul of America is all those people who are just going out and literally, many of them risking and losing their lives to carry the rest of us on their back. Look, I know you all need to get back to governing. So let me close by thanking you again for your work and always being available if I pick up the phone and call and ask for your input, and you’ve been exemplary leaders in a time of crisis. For real. I’m not just saying it. I know I speak for all of us when I say, thank you, thank you for all of the frontline workers you’re backing up, for all the people that are keeping our community running during crisis and risking, as we’ve just pointed out, all of us, their personal health and safety in the process. They’re real American heroes. They real American heroes are the doctors, the nurses, healthcare workers, EMTs, firefighters, police. If I can, as they used to say in the Senate, a point of personal privilege, a family member who had a problem out on the West coast, found themselves in an emergency, and these EMT guys and firefighters showing up and being there to take care of her. She’s fine now. But the point is, they show up. They don’t ask, “By the way, where are you from? How much money do you have? What’s your color? What’s your religion? What’s your background?” They just don’t do it. And grocery store workers, clerks, meat packers, farm workers, delivery drivers, the mass transit workers. All those folks, all too often the lowest paid, least appreciated members of society. But in this crisis, they’re showing us what is essential. And it’s making it clear about who is invaluable in our nation. I think it’s time we reward these people and actually make this country work better again. I want to thank you all for taking the time, sharing your insights. I know you are really on the line every single minute. We’ve talked today about a lot of difficult issues, but I know that we’re going to get through this together, because seeing the American character, the very soul of this country on display every day, we know there’s not a single thing we can’t accomplish when we stand together as one nation, united in purpose, taking care of our neighbors, committed to getting the job done. That’s what we’ve seen. Seen us through every crisis of the past. I think it’s going to see us through again, in no small part because of your leadership. So, I wish you well. If my mom were here, she’d look at you all, and Phil, we always quote our mom. She’d say, “God bless you, dear. God bless you for what you’re doing. I really mean it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We need you badly. You’re doing an incredible job. Thanks for taking the time. See you in Connecticut, Mr. Vice President. All right. God willing. [crosstalk 00:47:09] Mr. Vice President. Take care. You’ll see me more than you want me See me more than you want me once this is done. As you’ve all pointed out in the past, I’m usually the first one to show up and the last one to go home. I’m like the poor relative. But anyways, thank you all very, very much. Thank you. Take care. Thank you so much. God bless you. [crosstalk 00:47:25] guys. Good to see you, Gretchen. Bye."
"74","05-20-20"," Well, Ron, thanks. And thanks for that generous introduction. I appreciate you referencing what I’ve been through, but the truth is that… and I’m so happy your son, God love him, it looks like you’re okay. But 90,000 dead so far from this virus, and it’s climbing. It’s going to get higher. And like you, and like all the people on this panel, I think of all those mothers and fathers, husbands and wives who… moms and dads who’ve just been the victims of this virus. And it’s going to get much higher, it’s going to go higher. And the difference here is so many, especially if they’re losing a parent, an older person, those folks are taking their last breaths alone. They’re with a nurse in an ICU unit, holding a tablet up or a phone to say goodbye. And when you’ve been the recipient of so much kindness and so much empathy and support, it’s real easy to return it. You know what it means. But that’s what you’ve been doing all along, Ron. Thanks for doing this today, and for your remarkable leadership. I know I measure what happens, how the leaders that I’ve served with, based on not only whether they’re bright as hell and know what to do, but whether their feeling, whether their judgment about what to do comes from their gut or their head. I trust people who start with their gut, like the people you have on the panel. Their gut, and they have a head bright enough to know what to do about that gut feeling. People arrive at it purely from an intellectual standpoint, they’re not always the ones that can be counted on to stay through right at the very end when it gets really tough. And I just want to think you, because you’ve lead with your heart and your head, and I really mean that. I don’t want to turn this into the Mutual Admiration Society, but there’s leaders we know in the House and the Senate, and I’ve served with many, many of them, who have that special thing. Republicans as well as Democrats, where it starts here in the gut and it moves to the head. And that’s what you do. And everybody, I want to thank you for taking the time to be on this and to speak with me today. First and foremost, I hope that all of you joining us today and your families are staying safe and healthy. It’s an incredibly anxious moment for our nation and quite frankly, for the world. And my prayers, and I’m sure yours as well are with all those who are scared, who are sick, who are grieving, who are struggling just to get by. This crisis has touched every country and every community and every community in America, but also countries around the world. And in many rural communities especially, and by the way, most people don’t realize I come from a rural state. They think Delaware is in the East, it must be one of those big eastern… They know it’s a small state, but it must be an eastern state that is very congested. Truth of the matter is, our largest city in the state is a little over 150,000 people and our next largest is 22,000. And we’re an agricultural state. On the Delmarva Peninsula, it’s a $5 billion industry, agriculture. Soybeans mainly and also chickens. It’s a big, big industry for us. So my community hospital is having staying open. They’re having trouble attracting docs, they’re having trouble getting reimbursed. Our farmers are in trouble, and bankruptcies are real. And the pain has been especially profound in rural America. As you all know though, it wasn’t easy for rural American families before this crisis hit, before COVID-19. Wisconsin lost 10% of the dairy farmers in 2019, the largest drop since the state started tracking this. More than 800 dairy farms across the state went out of business. And according to the American Farm Bureau, Wisconsin now leads the nation in farm bankruptcies, and you all know the ripple effect that has with farm closures. It has a ripple effect not just on the farmers and their families, but on the entire community. Let alone more than 800 of these. Look, each one is a tragedy, and so much of that devastation is directly attributable to I think the disastrous trade war the President got us into. It didn’t just hit farmers. It also raised the price of food, beer, clothing, appliances for every consumer, and how many families could use that money right now? How many farmers would be in a better spot if their profits hadn’t vanished? Because Trump goaded our trade partners into placing brutal tariffs on American cheese. Look, bringing us back from the brink is going to require a monumental effort. We have to put an end to the health crisis that has already cost us more than I said, 90,000 lives. American lives, and we have to bring back the economy. When more than 36 million people have already lost their jobs, 36 million, and we can’t ignore the crisis that’s already taking shape in rural America before the virus hit. Because when rural communities struggle and young people are forced to leave Eau Claire for example, or Warrens or Lacrosse, that’s a warning sign to all of us. That’s the central premise of America has been broken. That’s why I’m committed to restoring the promise of the middle class for rural America and rural Americans. I put forward an ambitious plan, one that recognized something that I don’t think the present President does. Farmers aren’t looking for a payoff, they’re looking for an opportunity. And we’re going to create a new bio-based multi-manufacturing job environment to deal farmers in on the benefits of a changing economy. We’re going to invest, I’ve been pushing this for a while and you have too, Ron, a $20 billion expansion in broadband across rural areas so that every child has a chance to thrive, every business has a chance to compete. Every hospital has a chance to do telemedicine. We’re also going to support smart legislation to get rural communities back on track. Senator Baldwin introduced a bipartisan bill that would help stabilize rural economies and repair food supply chains that have been disrupted by this pandemic. That type of action is critical now. There’s a whole lot more to my plan and others, but here’s the principle that underlines it all. Rural communities power our nation. They feed our bodies, they fuel our engines. They’re the stewards that protect our lands, and we cannot sustain an economy that exact value from them without ever sharing in the rewards. It doesn’t make sense from an economic perspective. And look, but more than that, it goes to the character of the country. Our fates are bound together now more than they’ve ever been, and people are beginning to realize it. And the only way we’re going to come through this crisis and rebuild our economy is by ensuring that we leave no one, no community behind. We need leadership and policies that reflect that truth because American people, they already get it. They’ve never let this country down given half the chance. And especially in the face of COVID-19, we’re seeing incredible American grit and the spirit of America shine through and you’re a big part of that. So I want to thank you all for keeping the faith, I’m looking forward to our conversation and any advice you have for me as well, I’m wide open. Look, rural America is America, is where our values emanate from. It really matters, and we’ve got to make it stronger. Well, thank you Mr. Vice President, for those comments, for your leadership through all this and you’ve got a great panel now to get some feedback from and to listen to and engage. So let me go to our first panelist, Mary [Freibert 00:08:46]. I’ve known Mary for a number of years. She’s CEO of Scenic Bluffs Community Health Center in Cashton, Wisconsin. It’s a small, rural community a little bit east of Lacrosse up in the bluff. Beautiful area, also the center of the renewable energy capital of Wisconsin right now. It’s been amazing what they’ve done. But Mary in her position has been on the frontline, servicing at-risk individuals, families, those who have a more difficult time accessing the healthcare system in rural Wisconsin. She brings a depth of knowledge and understanding that I’ve relied upon throughout the years. So, Mary, thanks for joining us and I’ll hand the screen over to you now. Awesome. Thank you, Congressman Kind. Thank you too, Vice President Biden for the opportunity to talk today. The issues that we are facing at the Community Health Center are significant on a normal day. During this time of the pandemic, it’s been seriously overwhelming. But we are proud and excited to continue to do the work and the hard work to try and protect the people of this region. Last year, I’ll give you a little background on the health center. Last year, we served 7,600 patients with about 23,000 visits. We have medical, dental, mental health services, we have acupuncture, chiropractor, massage therapy. We have an on-site pharmacy, and the people that we are privileged to serve come from all walks of life. Urban, more urban I guess for us, is people from the city of Lacrosse, which is about 50,000 and we serve people from Cashton, which is 1,100. That’s our home base, our mothership. We also have a clinic in the village of Norwalk. Norwalk is home to a meatpacking plant. We have a large number of new immigrant workers, primarily from the state of Oaxaca, Mexico. We have a lot of patients who are Amish, so they’re old order Amish relying on horse and buggies. And so for 26 years, the health center has been here providing services to those patients and those individuals and we’re super excited to continue to do that. The thing that’s been overwhelming for us has been the pandemic. So I feel like I would be able to share with you the normal, day to day work that we do, but right now, we’re in the midst of trying to address the focus that we need to take on preventing the spread of highly infectious disease. You mentioned Mr. Vice President, the 90,000 people that have died. I think of that, and that’s been in less than three months, and the fact that there isn’t a comprehensive national plan for testing, and there hasn’t been supplies that are needed. It feels like unforced errors and it’s preventable and that is tragic, and I get very sad. People talk about the healthcare workers, and we’re privileged to employ 80 people and they’re out there doing the work every day. I do not want any of our employees or any people that work at the critical access hospitals in Viroqua or Sparta or the hospitals in Lacrosse, I don’t want people to be in the midst of doing what they do best, which is providing healthcare services, but not having adequate equipment and supplies. And when you hear conversations about healthcare workers putting their lives on the line and going in as heroic battlers, it doesn’t have to be that way. Had we had adequate PPE, had we had an adequate supply of reagents and test supplies, had we had a comprehensive plan that was put in place, immediately, this could have been avoided. That said, we have what we have. And so in rural Wisconsin, we’re in a low incidence community right now and we want to keep it that way. So what we’re actually doing today as I speak is doing a community testing event. It’s drive-up testing for asymptomatic individuals. The goal is to identify people who have the virus if they’re ill and identify people who have the virus if they don’t know if they’re ill. And so testing and contact tracking through the local public health departments and everybody else who’s working on that treatment and support for those folks, until we get to the point until we have a vaccine, this is what we need to continue to do and it shouldn’t be a fight for rural communities to find contact individuals and to find testing supplies. And unfortunately, it has been a bit of a fight, but what rural does best is sort of stand and deliver. Right? You give us a problem, and we’ll do it. The people who have been working through this entire time are the people who we want to make sure we give the opportunity to understand the status, so the people who’ve been at the grocery stores and the hardware store, and people who have been driving truck and farmers and people as healthcare workers, and local volunteer EMTs and firefighters. Those are the folks that we want to make sure have the ability to understand their virus status, and we want to do that as many times as we need to do that to make sure that the community stays safe. Reducing the spread was effective. We lowered, we flattened the curve and now we’re dealing with a constant presence of a virus, and that’s public health and we know how to handle that. We need to follow the science, we need to listen to the epidemiologists, we need to listen to public health, we need to support primary care, community health center, primary care, that’s what we’re all about. So, those are the things that we’re most interested in working on. I think that just the other point I wanted to make, with this god awful economic downturn we’ve hit, this recession that’s moving into the potential of a depression, we have a lot more people who have lost employer-based health insurance coverage. The Kaiser Foundation, I was just reading, came out with a study that said they expect 26 and a half million people to lose employer-based healthcare coverage. When we have a strong Medicaid program, when we have a strong Affordable Care Act program, that gives people coverage. And the Kaiser Foundation said it’s 12.7 million are eligible for Medicaid. Let’s get those people enrolled. The health center is committed to making sure people are enrolled in Medicaid. Wonderful program, strongly effective for people in rural communities. And then the Foundation also said that over eight million are potentially eligible for Affordable Care Act enrollment, and right now, at a time when those programs are under stress and strain and a bit of attack is exactly the time that the large insurers are starting to come back to it. So we have to have a strong Affordable Care Act. We have to have strong Medicaid coverage, because people are going to be grappling with illness and wanting to stay healthy and we right now have an employer-based insurance program that supports healthcare services and we want to make sure to get those. So, I’m appreciative of the opportunity to talk with you this morning about some of those issues. Mary, there’s a lot you’ve raised. I’m going to just ask you one question now, and for insight and then maybe get to the rest and we can have a conversation. But one of the things I’m hearing as I do these round tables around the country, no matter where I am, whether it’s in the Northeast or out West or in the Southeast, is that community health centers are… They’ve always been under stress and reimbursement is a big thing. As you pointed out, you have 80 employees. You also affect the health of the economy in the town you’re in. It makes a big difference. You’re not on the verge of closing, but in my state and in many other states, a lot of community health centers, rural hospitals have closed down because they’re not getting reimbursed, they can’t stay open. The compensation is not the same. So, if you don’t want to answer now, think about it. But two questions. One, I hear an awful lot about the increased need for mental healthcare. Mental healthcare, that it’s rising significantly, and the resources available to provide that kind of care, because when we did the Affordable Care Act, we made sure there was a one to one correlation between… There’s no distinction between breaking your arm and having a mental health problem. They’re both health problems and there should not be a stigma attached. So if you could talk to me at some point a little bit about what you see in the last four months, if there’s been a rise, and number two, if in fact you expect things to change for the good or the bad in the meantime. And what that does, and how that impacts on your resources. And to make sure that every kid has access to online learning and because they have access to high speed broadband, every business can make their judgements to know what’s going on in the rest of the state, the rest of the world. As well as you being able to have telemedicine be part of the concerns that are available, that the kind of help you could provide to the very rural areas that extend beyond you, to those very small towns, from everything from accidents to advice. I’m happy to respond to those and actually the mental health question and the telemedicine question fit together for us right now. So the village that we’re in, Cashton, is supported by really strong telecommunication co-op that has wired the village for broadband. So, the village is covered. The mental health services are… You’re spot on. People, there remains a stigma around mental health services. We provide mental health services to the community. It’s a thing that we continue to focus on during this. During COVID, that was during the initial phases of the pandemic, mental health services was the one that maintained a lot of services because we were able to switch to phone based services. Scenic Bluffs had never had telemedicine capacity until about four weeks ago. And when this started, we had always been talking about doing that other places had done it. We had never stood up that because of cost and a lot of things. But when we quickly saw the need for reducing people’s exposures, safer at home, we switched and we turned on telemedicine services in three weeks. And half of the visits that we’re doing right now are telemedicine based. We are fortunate in the village that there is access to those services. The delivery of telemedicine services depends on a person in their home having access to a reliable internet. And when you’re in lots of rural communities that still doesn’t exist. So funding for broadband, support for building out that infrastructure is critical to continued growth of telemedicine services. So anything that you can do to continue the support for broadband building out is hugely important. Just one other thing I wanted to highlight is the ongoing stressful nature of this pandemic requires us to do more mental health services. It requires a comprehensive approach to understanding the trauma that people are facing. Even if you don’t know anyone who’s been stricken with the virus or is ill, this is stressful and it’s overwhelming and it’s exhausting. And we need to do more to support community health centers. We believe strongly in community and we work with our local public schools and we continue to do services there, but I’m very concerned that this pandemic will tax the mental health system. And we really need to continue to focus on building that out with programs and providers, because this is going to be a long struggle for a lot of people. Well, I think we need a strong and efficient and fair system in place to test and trace contacts of people who’ve been infected with COVID-19. But so far, I find it very unacceptable that several months into this crisis, we don’t even have that yet, and there’s no responsibility that is absorbed nationally. President says, “Not my responsibility. That’s not my job description.” This isn’t rocket science. It just takes an investment and execution. Both of which have been, I think, gravely lacking. That’s why I call on the President to create what I call, create a pandemic testing board, to make sure the testing is not just being scaled up, but scaled everywhere. So there’s adequate testing in place everywhere it’s needed. Now we’ve got to create a new, I think also a new public health service jobs court to ensure that contact tracing reaches at every underserved community in America, and that it’s ideally done by members of those folks in the community. After this pandemic passes, they’re going to help fight other health crises as well, like opioid addiction, an epidemic which you’ve had to face as well and which haunts rural America. And finally, the experience of other nations in past pandemic teaches us one, we have to be prepared for a resurgence of cases. And I know Donald Trump says the weather, everything’s going to be fine, and we’re going to have a vaccine tomorrow, and don’t worry about, it’s going to go away and going to be like a miracle, et cetera. Well, I think it’s pretty important we tell the truth to the American people. They can handle anything. What they can’t handle is false expectations that then get just absolutely dumped over the edge. And I think the President should immediately establish a second wave strategy through plenty stockpiles of personal protective equipment and other key supplies that were going to needing in the months ahead. And so there’s a lot we can do. And I want to get back to this when I talk again, we talked a little bit about the business side. But part of what I find is the great, great anxiety and the mental health concerns relate not just to whether you are worried that you have COVID-19, whether you are infected, but how do you keep the lights on in your business? You just had to lay off your 12 employees and Main Street. You just had to [inaudible 00:25:09] you’re going bankrupt. You’re going to… I mean, this is causing great anxiety and there’s a lot we can do that related to what has already been passed with small businesses that the President just hasn’t done. And look, a combination of failing to move quickly. If we had moved back in January, when not only was our outgoing administration telling them that this is a big problem and set up a pandemic office within the White House and the like, but they had 12, I think it’s 10 or 12 times, there’s a thing called, excuse the acronyms, a PDB, Presidential Daily Briefing that occurs every morning. I’d sit with President Obama every morning, we’d get a briefing from the intelligence community and what was going on internationally, et cetera. The intelligence community warned the President 10 different occasions, according to the press and according to the accounts that had been made available, that there is a pandemic. This is a problem. You’ve got to be prepared. This was in early January. And he either as was stated by, I think I’m correct to this, and at least it was stated in the press. He either didn’t read the report or he didn’t listen to it and didn’t do anything. A lot of this could have been prevented. A lot of it could have been prevented. COVID-19 is not his fault. Failure to respond quickly is a big problem. It’s called lack of leadership. And now I am hoping, and I don’t see it yet, he has to speed up the process as well. He has to move on to things that have to be done now, and that’s not happening. So I’m hoping that what he does is when people listening to this and many other things out there, that they put pressure on the President to step up. Start to tell the truth, listen to the science, lay out how the federal government has a responsibility to make sure that the resources get to places they’re needed. I noticed your phrase, you use the phrase and I know listeners, I know everybody on this panel knows it, but you said that what you need more is you need… You talked about PPE. [inaudible 00:27:29] the help. And you said you need the reagents. That’s the stuff for testing. You have the machine, and if you don’t have the material that goes into that testing machine to determine when you put the swab in whether or not you have COVID, it doesn’t work very well. And we’re short on that as well. So, but I’m talking too long right now as if it’s just you and me. Let us go onto the next couple of speakers and then maybe we can have everybody else chime in on what concerns them as well. But thank you. And I am a gigantic supporter of a significant increase, I’ve called for in the whole idea of community hospitals, community centers, community health centers. It just is a big deal, especially in rural communities. Thank you. Thank you Mr. Vice President, and you’re exactly right. And the people are desperately looking for leadership that can unite us, that we’re all in this together. Rather than just seeking the political fault lines in an attempt to divide us. Mary, thank you for your insight today and for joining us. Let’s turn next to Rob Grover. Rob is the Economic Development and Tourism Coordinator in rural Trempealeau County. Rob is a five generation family farm owner in a small community up by Galesville. He’s also a small business owner. He’s at the front lines of helping these small businesses and helping our rural communities fight through this virus and also the economic recovery plan that we desperately need. So, Rob, thanks for joining us today. Well, thank you, Ron. And thank you, Mr. Vice President. It’s a real honor to be able to join you here from Trempealeau County today. And some of the folks told me I had to make sure that you saw my Trempealeau County shirt here. I see it. That’s nice. So, we’re not in Trempealeau County. Yeah, we can’t wait until we can have you in County here. I like to be there. I wish I were with you now. You have a hell of a job pal, right now. A lot going on, a lot going on. And as you know, in mid-March really almost overnight, we saw a shutdown of huge segments of our economy here in rural Wisconsin. Bars and restaurants and hair salons and small shops and places like that, that are really the backbone of rural Wisconsin. And just to give you a little taste of Trempealeau County, we have no city or village more or larger than 3000 people. We’re a very small, tight knit community. And those sorts of businesses really are essential to our community, not only as social hubs, but as important economic drivers. So when those places close, overnight, basically, we had business people losing their income and we had their workers losing their incomes as well. And Trempealeau County and a lot of rural Wisconsin is a very low wage County, if you will. We’re not wealthy people. A lot of people working for minimum wage or a little higher. Maybe 10 to 12 to $15 an hour. And a lot of people’s supplemental income too is working at these bars and restaurants and side jobs. And they sort of depend on those side gigs to be able to get by. So it was incredibly devastating. And as I’ve mentioned earlier, with so many people losing jobs, they also lost access to things like their health care and things like that. So, one of my big jobs has been to try to connect both business owners and individuals that find themselves all of a sudden without either their business income or any income coming in personally, connecting them to both local state and federal program. And that’s really been the majority of my work lately. And one important program that some businesses have been able to take advantage of is paycheck protection program. And I just want to take the opportunity to thank you Representative Kind for your work helping to get that program funded. It’s an incredibly important program that some businesses have been able to utilize. But one real problem has been that a lot of small businesses, especially in the first round of funding for that, couldn’t get access. There was a young lady, she owns a salon in a Whitehall here, it’s called the Bluebird Salon. Brandy Berg is her name. And actually that’s not Brandy up, but that’s okay. Brandy applied for the program. There she goes. There’s Brandy at the bottom of your screen there. But she applied for the program, did all the hard work of organizing it, worked with her local lending institution, and finally got her application in. Well, the bank told her that they were having so many problems actually accessing the SBA portal to be able to put these loans through, so it created an incredible backlog. And that’s a story I heard from so many lending institutions in our area. But what ended up happening is the program ran out of money about a half an hour before Brandy was able to have her bank, her lending institution put in her application. And I think where a lot of anger has come with some of the federal response to this, especially in rural Wisconsin, is that it seems really easy for large corporations, million, billion dollar companies, to get this funding really quickly. They’ve got teams of lawyers, they’ve got teams of lobbyists, they’ve got connections to people in power. But when it comes to small businesses that were relying on that money, they couldn’t get access to it when they needed it. Now, a silver lining. Brandy, she was able to get funding when the second round of funding came. That’s one thing I point out, I think right now, rural Wisconsin and rural businesses feel like they’re being left behind by this administration. They feel like unless you’ve got connections, unless you are a million dollar donor or something like that, your voice isn’t going to get heard. So I think that’s a big problem. Now here in Wisconsin, as you know, good or bad, the state is starting to reopen. Our stay at home order was overthrown by the state supreme court. And now a lot of businesses find themselves in the situation where they’re uneasy about the future. They want to get open. Every business wants to get people back in and enjoy their business, but they’re really worried about doing it safely. And I think we’ve really lacked leadership from the federal government down to the states saying, “Hey, this is our plan for you to do it safely. And also what businesses are telling me and my own business is dealing with this, how do we properly secure the PPE that we need to both protect our workers and to protect the general public coming in? It’s hard to get, it’s expensive right now. And I really think we could have benefited from a national plan to, first off, make sure hospitals have what they need. And then as we think about the reopening working with our business communities in all areas, including rural areas, to be able to secure that. Even though Wisconsin is starting to open up again, if people don’t feel confident that they can come into your business and be safe, they’re not going to show up. And I know a lot of businesses as well are really worried about being open again, but because we don’t really have any plans for how we’re going to deal with this now, especially in Wisconsin, are we going to have to close again in three months because of a resurgence? And then what’s the plan going to be? Businesses can’t survive if they can’t be open, but if we don’t have guidance on how to do it safely, it’s a real mess for everyone. Businesses thrive on consistency. We need that from the federal government. I really don’t think that’s what we’re getting right now. So, I’ve talked a lot about challenges that rural businesses are dealing with, but I also just want to touch real quick on the fact that in rural Wisconsin, as was mentioned earlier, people are resilient. They make things work because we always have. We always have less resources, we’re less populated, so we have to make things work. So there’s a lot of businesses that adapted really quick, and even though there’s incredible challenges, are thriving. One of them is this wonderful little cafe in Galesville, it’s called the Garden of Eden. I think we’ve got a picture for you there, coming up at some point. But the Garden of Eden, Bill and Amy own it, husband and wife couple. And basically overnight… And if you’ve ever been to their place, it’s incredible. It’s the sort of place you want to sit inside and be a part of. But overnight, they basically had to transition their whole operation to be to go orders and things like that, and the logistics of making that happen. And they’ve done it and they’ve done it really successfully. Another business, Anna’s her name, she owns a place called Cooley Boutique. Also in southern Trempealeau County. I think we’ve got a picture for you. And she was a woman’s clothing store, which of course in Wisconsin, technically wasn’t considered an essential service. So what Anna did… There she is. And that’s her in her shop. She was able to really quickly transition her business to doing more online, using social media. They started to do live fashion shows and auctions and that sort of thing. So she transitioned quickly. So I guess I didn’t want to just talk about the doom and gloom. Rural business owners, rural business people, rural people in general, when times are tough, we make things work. But it sure feels like right now from the federal government, rural Wisconsin isn’t getting a fair shake. Rural America is not getting a fair shake. So I guess I would leave you with that. There’s always challenges in rural Wisconsin, some have been talked about. Access to broadband internet, which to business people, it’s just as important as rural electrification was for us 80 years ago. We need to have strong internet for us to be able to survive in a 21st century economy. Funding for rural infrastructure. I know you’ve been a real champion when you were a Vice President for infrastructure investments, which are incredibly important to us in rural America. You know if a bridge goes out or a road goes out here and this area often not another way to get your products out, to get people to your business [crosstalk 00:38:09] to get to your home. So affordable housing is such a huge issue for us here. A lot of folks would love to actually move to our rural area, but it’s tough to find affordable housing. And I guess I could go on and on about the challenges of rural Wisconsin. But again, I want to thank you for focusing on us today because I maybe said it a few times, but really feels like rural America sometimes gets forgotten about, and we really need a focus economically that’s not just about Wall Street, but once again focuses on Main Street business because that’s what really drives us here in rural Wisconsin. So thank you so much. Well, Rob, thank you very much. You guys are lucky you have the Congressman that you do, and I’m not being solicitous when I say that, because what I’m going to talk about for a second here are things that he’s led the way on. And I think we’re going to get there, but it’s been a painful way to get there. Look, small businesses are the foundation of our communities and of this country and the American dream. And they also hire more people than everybody than all those major corporations combined. Now, long before COVID, there used to be a basic bargain that was built in this country and it’s been broken. For too many working families the Trump economy was far from booming. Now because of what I call the corrupt recovery, is focusing on helping the wealthy and the well-connected, not the millions of mom and pops facing financial ruin. The warning signs are flashing. 40% of the initial small business funds didn’t go to small businesses at all. Period. And two months after Congress created the Main Street Lending Program for small and midsize businesses, the administration is still hasn’t lent a single dollar, not a single dollar has gone out. Now I’ve done this before, and I think we’ve done it the right way. In our administration when we had the financial collapse that we inherited, the President put me in charge of administering the $800 billion Recovery Act in the last recession to boost small businesses, sparked 75 months of job growth. As President I’m going to make sure that we’ll do this the right way. Reserve half of all the new payroll protection funds for small businesses with less than 50 employees. Now technically, small businesses with 500 or less employees. Well in your community or mine, 500 employees is a big business. It’s huge. Okay, it’s huge. But small businesses with their fixed costs like rent and overhead so they can not just keep their workers on the payroll, but also keep the lights on. I’m working on a new ideas to help bring small businesses out from under the shadow of this high interest debt and these debt collection agencies so you get a fresh start. And look, I would keep a close eye on the distribution of relief so it goes to the small businesses who need it rather than the wealthy and the well connected. Look, I’d appoint an inspector… But let’s think about this for a minute. When I was doing that $800 billion program, we got all that money out in 18 months, keeping us from a depression, even conservative economists acknowledged. And less than two tenths of 1% waste or fraud. Because I worked, every single week I sat down with the inspector general, an independent agent who looked over my shoulder to make sure I was doing what the law required us to do. And this President has fired every inspector general from the state department to what was called for and Ron and others set up an inspector general proposal in the CARES Act, which they passed. He fired him. Why is that? Who’s looking over anybody’s shoulder here? So on day one, if I’m elected, with Ron’s help I’m going to appoint an inspector general to make sure that the funds are spent fairly and transparently. This is beginning of January, [inaudible 00:42:23] and the way in which we can be in a situation where that happens is we’re able to take a look and see what is going to happen. Because if we don’t look at it, we’re going to find, and we’re already finding. You know where the bulk of the loans went? The biggest loans went to the folks for small businesses who have major hotel chains and making sure chains worth a billion bucks, or maybe it’s not a total billion, but close to it, and they’re getting the loans. And so what Ron did, he came along and said, we’re going to have on this PPP program, this paycheck protection, we’re going to make sure that it in fact gets to people who are on Main Street and it’s about employees. I think we have to focus on how do you keep Main Street open. You’re going to ride down and you ride down the small towns of my state and your state and you see they’re closed. Not just closed because of the order of social distancing, they’re closed because they can’t turn the lights on, they can’t pay the rent. They can’t keep it open. They can’t keep their employees. Not one more penny should go to a Fortune 500 company, period. Period. Not a single penny. They don’t need it. They don’t need it. We have to keep Main Street open because it’s the heart and soul that makes everything beat in all these small communities in my state and yours. And the other thing you mentioned was that you said that you talked about the salon and the SBA portal being overrun. Look, what’s happening with unemployment in your state, unemployment insurance and access to it. We now have a position where, because of the leadership of Ron and others, that if you lose your job, we beefed up the unemployment position so that in addition to what unemployment you’d get, including in a gig economy, they’re now being covered, you get $600 on top of that, up to the equivalent of $75,000 income. Well guess what? It’s not getting out there. The reason it’s not getting out there is the federal government did not help prepare states that are going to be overwhelmed, overwhelmed as they have been with all these claims. Over 30 some million claims so far, it’s going to go up. The other thing is that when you talk about the PPE there is no national plan. The President says, for example, tomorrow he’s going to be in Michigan visiting the Ford plant that was arranged to make sure the respirators were available [inaudible 00:45:05] the Defense Production Act. Well, guess what, I call for him to do that, not just me, but I happen to be the first one to call from and do that a couple months earlier. What took so long? Why is it taking so long? And now we’re in a situation where we need essentially a supply commander, just if you’re ever in the military, like the military. Who knows in war where every tank, plane, rocket, every piece of equipment is so you know where to send it where it’s most needed. Well, the President says that’s not my job it’s the local governors. I mean, it’s the governors, the local mayors and the county executives. And this is a national problem. We’re at war. We’re at war with the virus. We need a commander and chief who can garner the resources and distribute the resources, ways that everybody can get them. And what is the other point I wanted to make, because I’m making notes of what you were saying here… The blah, blah, blah. Well, I’ll go back to it when I talk about an IGN… Oh, I know it was. The whole idea of you saying that a lot of your colleagues who are in small businesses don’t know what the circumstances on how they should reopen, what they should do. Well, as Ron can tell you, there is a report, and I can’t comment beyond this, that said the Center for Disease Control laid out detailed plans as to how you should reopen, what precautions you should take to not only give confidence that your employees will be safe, but also have confidence that people will come into the restaurant because they know all the major precautions are being taken. Well, guess what? President blocked that from being released. And then after a lot of heat saying what was going to happen, they finally did release a plan, I promise you, is not the detailed plan they first wrote. Not the plan they first wrote. Why is that? Why would the federal government, with the experts of the Center for Disease Control, not be able to lay out in detail, how you can most safely reopened to protect your employees, to protect your customers. Why? Because the President wants one thing. He wants to be able to be going into the fall saying the economy’s coming back, look at the stock market, is rising. But what everybody’s predicting, has happened to other places, if you don’t do this well, there’s going to be a second wave. But the bottom line is protecting people and telling the truth, laying out truthfully what it is that needs to be done, what the problems are, because guess what? You said, Wall Street is getting too much. Wall Street didn’t build America. I’ve been saying this for 35 years. Ordinary, hard working, middle class, hard working people, working class people, built the country. But you got to give them half a chance. You got to give them at least half a chance to do it. I find myself staring at you in the screen. And they’re probably wondering what, tell I’m looking at here because I’m looking down. But the point is that we got to make sure that these funds are spent fairly and transparently, that everybody knows where every dollar is going. And this program that your Congressmen helped put through, which was this whole notion that we’re going to deal with the Main Street fund, not a penny has gone out yet. There’s a lot of things we can do, but I’ll get into it later if you want to. But anyway, thanks for what you’re doing. God bless you for trying. And I think that what the, what, the one thing that I think is being underestimated is the resiliency of the American people. 20% of the population is rural America, but it is the heart of America. It’s the heart of America, not a joke. In my state and every other state, and it needs to be treated more fairly than it’s been. Thank you, Mr. Vice President. And Rob, thanks so much for your insight and the leadership that you’ve been showing. And Mr. Vice President, I couldn’t agree with you more. All Americans should share your concern about the current President’s penchant to fire all of our independent inspectors. These are nonpartisan, career investigators in charge of rooting out waste, fraud and abuse within our federal departments, programs and agencies. They’re literally the sunshine democracy needs, which is the best disinfectant to root out waste, fraud and abuse. And so you’ve got to wonder why President Trump so fond of firing these nonpartisan inspector generals right now. I think it’s very dangerous. And Ron, you know that used to be a hobby horse for Republican senators. Republican senators joined Democrats, they were strongly, strongly, strongly supportive of these independent inspector generals, starting with Chairman Grassley and others. Where are they? Why aren’t they speaking up about this? It really bothers me and bothers me a lot, but I don’t want to get going on it. No, absolutely. Let’s bring into the conversation in Darren Von Ruden. Darren is the current President of Wisconsin Farmers Union. He has a three-generation family farm himself, an organic dairy farm up on the Ridge east of Lacrosse. And there’s probably no one who has better insight on the challenges that our family farmers production, agriculture’s, going through right now here in the state of Wisconsin. Darren, thanks for joining us today. Thanks Darren. And thank you, Mr. Vice President for the opportunity to tell my story and tell the story of a few farmers across the state too. And I think in your opening remarks you said one thing that really sticks true to what’s happening in the dairy industry, in Wisconsin’s number one industry. 10% of our farmers went out of business last year. Yep. And the year before that we lost 8% of our farmers in the State of Wisconsin. And it all boils down to economics. I think the other comment that you made in your opening remarks too, that really sticks true to farmers beliefs is that we want to get our income from the marketplace. We don’t want to have to continue to take those government handouts, but when you are stressed and we need them, you take them. So how do we get to a system where farmers have more control over their own destiny? Is probably the biggest question. And that’s something that Wisconsin Farmers Union has been working on over the last three years is looking at a growth management program area industry, and how farmers can control their own destiny by making sure that they’re not wasting our most number one natural resource in water. It takes a lot of water to produce really any agricultural product. And so why are we producing and continuing to overproduce, all commodities. Not just milk but corn, soybeans, fruits, and vegetables. We’re seeing because of the Coronavirus now, issues of having to just dump milk, euthanize hogs, chickens, and pigs, simply because we don’t have the slaughtering capacity to deal with it because the workers in the plants are sick. I think it’s a really one thing when a President uses his Presidential authorities for war powers, but when you’re asking combat warriors, which meat plant workers are, to go in unprotected, it’s like sending our military into a war without weapons. It’s just frustrating as a farmer to have to see my fellow farmers destroying animals and destroying crops because of the system that we currently have. I think one of the other things that we really need to look at and focus on is bringing those dollars back into rural communities. It’s been said by the other guests here too, that rural communities really are the backbone of what happens around the States and around the country, really. And once you start losing the backbone of those communities, which is the businesses, the farmers, you lose the whole community. And we’re seeing way too much of that here in the State of Wisconsin. Getting to the trade issues, farmers from around the country spent millions of dollars building up trade partners in other countries, and really overnight with the President’s trade wars that started back in 2017, farmers lost those partners. And like any other business, if you’re a bad partner, you’re a bad salesman. You don’t get to sell again. They find somebody else to deal with. And that’s exactly what’s happening with a lot of the countries right now. They found another partner to buy their goods from. And when you look at agriculture as a number one business in the state of Wisconsin, we’re really struggling right now because we’re not getting that income coming in because our foreign markets have disappeared. Really an agriculture, we really took a double whammy with the trade wars that were started. Number one, we lost our income. A lot of places dropped by 25% to 30%. And then we turned around and tried to buy the materials that we need to keep our businesses running, and those prices raised 20%. So really was the trade war good for agriculture? No, I think it was about a year ago, the President said dairy farmers are over the hump. We’re still losing over two dairy farms a day in the state of Wisconsin. So being over the hump really isn’t here yet. And will we see it? I don’t know. The Coronavirus has had a detrimental impact on the dairy industry. Our pay prices went from the high teens, $17, $18 per hundred weight down to, most farmers in May are receiving $10 to $11. The average cost reduction is in that $17.50 cent range for milk. So looking at that kind of a loss, even the PPP program, a lot of individual farmers like myself, we didn’t qualify because we were our sole employee. And to get dollars, even a few dollars would make a difference on some days. So Congressman Kind has worked on that issue too, to try to make sure that more people are eligible to receive those payments. I wanted to say, thank you, Vice President Biden for your work in the past. I think one other issue, I guess, I’d like to mention too quick is monopolies. Social security. Under your leadership and President Obama’s leadership, there was a task force that was put together back in 2010 that looked at the monopoly issues, antitrust issues. And that’s a big impact in agriculture and really in all industries, when we have fewer and fewer players controlling what’s going on, we’re all at the detriment of that process at the end of the day. So thank you, Mr. Vice President. Well, by the way, Joe’s good enough. But let me respond to what you had to say, Darren, if I may. First of all, this country is now being reminded that that food just doesn’t magically appear on our plates. For ingenuity and hard work. We’ve long been able to feed the nation and most of the world. And we couldn’t be any more critical today than it’s ever been. You’re really and all your colleagues are incredibly important, and you deserve support from every level of the government. And you need some leadership from the highest level to do what’s best. Now that’s not what Trump is providing. Today in the richest country in the history of the world, tens of millions of people don’t have enough to eat. In the United States, don’t have enough to eat today. One in six Americans may be unable to afford their next meal within this year. The same time, farmers are left no option as you point out, but to dump millions of gallons of milk on the ground they’ve worked so hard to produce. Plowing over produce that used to sell in restaurants and schools and in stadiums, and wondering how they’re going to stay afloat through the year. We don’t have a food shortage problem. We have a leadership problem. And from the start, Trump has failed to support food producers. Slow to order the government to buy food from farmers and send that food to food banks. He failed to step up to do that. Instead of getting hard hit families the food they need, Trump is in court right now trying to condition food assistance on a work requirement at a time there’s no work. At a time 36 million people are already out of a job. The so-called SNAP program. If I were President today, here’s what I’d be doing: I would have the federal government should be purchasing milk from dairy farmers that lost their big purchasers like restaurants and schools, and have been badly hit by this terrible trade policy that made no sense. The problem with China was China was stealing our intellectual secrets. China was stealing intellectual information. China was engaged in cyber warfare. China was insisting that a business to do business in China had to have a 51% ownership in China. There are the things China was doing. It wasn’t about milk. It wasn’t about agriculture. And what’s happening is we’ve got to make sure the food goes now because we’ve lost those partners. And now they can’t even afford it so nonprofits feeding the hungry. Congress should pay agriculture. Pay you guys to buy this stuff from you and deliver it to those folks that in fact desperately need those public programs, that desperately are feeding thousands of people. You turn on your television. How do you see those lines of cars two miles long to get a meal? They have someone come up in a mask, open the trunk, and drop food in for the day. Congress gave Trump’s agriculture department to do exactly what I’m talking about in March. To get funds processors, like companies that bottle milk so they can move a food supply to the people that need it. You can get it to them, a point of food systems coordinator, that’s going to know where there is a food shortage and how to get food to people in need. And we’re going to work to enact Feed Act. And I did an event last night with that Chef Jose Andres. His nonprofit paying restaurants to make meals for people who were experiencing hunger. This is a win-win. It allows restaurants to stay open or reopen. It hires back their workers. It gives people going hungry access to meals, and is good for farmers and ranchers because it means restaurants will be able to buy and prepare those meals. So look, the Feed Act is going to also allow us to scale up the idea nationally. Now, that’s the type of leadership we need from the White House right now and the leadership that I pray, with the help of Ron, I can restore. But you’re right about everything you’ve said in my humble opinion. And think about what we try to do in our administration. Look how hard it is for a young farmer to get a start. That’s why we provided that 15,000 bucks right off the top. I mean, we set up a system whereby we’re going to have the Justice Department look at the issue of whether or not you’re engaged in this whole notion of monopolies. And what happens to a lot of folks like both of you who have been in your families for two, three, four, five generations, whatever it’s been, well, if you have enough land, you can hold on. You can make it. But there’s a lot of people who can’t. They’re gone. How do they get in the business? How do we keep people in farming? And the idea of us going to just one big agribusiness notion I think is a gigantic mistake. It lacks flexibility. It keeps people out of the system. And there’s a whole lot. There’s a whole lot we can do. And I think one of the things we should be focusing on now is for every one of those meals that a restaurant prepares essentially, and that Chef Andres is talking about, they get paid $10 on average for each of those meals. Well that keeps their employees on a payroll. It allows businesses to stay open. It hires people. Doesn’t mean people are going to that restaurant in large numbers. It means they’re able to get those meals to people who in fact don’t have a meal, including the school lunch programs, and get into them getting fed. I don’t know whether you guys have, and I’m sure you do in your county and in your region, food banks. Well, people are hurting big time. And this is a place where could help farmers, we could help restaurants that prepares the food, and we could also help the idea that people aren’t going to have a meal. Talk about being deprived of your dignity. Being a parent who lost a job and can’t figure out how to feed their family. Tomorrow what’s going to happen? And at the same time, what’s he doing? As I said, he’s trying to eliminate the SNAP program. He’s cutting the amount of money the SNAP program gets instead of paying you all more to produce the food and make sure they have more access to buy the food. I don’t know. I find it as ridiculous as we talked to Mary about talking about trying to get rid of Obamacare in the middle of a health crisis. Going to federal court to wipe out health insurance that’s available. And by the way, one other the thing. Maybe I failed to mention that report you referenced where 26 million people are going to lose their employer-based health insurance. Well, there’s a system in place where if your company can’t afford to continue to maintain that program, you can buy in and pay more money to keep that program you had. Well, people can’t do that anymore. It should be funded a hundred percent by the federal government, that program, so people can keep their healthcare until this crisis pass. Look, there’s two pieces to this and I don’t know the Congressman will agree with me on this. I think he will. But look, we have to number one, deal with the first part of this whole crisis, which hasn’t been dealt with well at all. And that is we have to sustain people in basic needs that they have, try to keep businesses open, try to keep in a situation where people have their unemployment insurance. They’re able to take care of their healthcare, et cetera. That is to sustain. Then we’re going to have a next phase, which is going to start probably in January, February, March to rebuild a country. To rebuild what’s happened. And it goes back to what you’re talking about, Rob, in your part of the world, rebuilding the infrastructure. For example, with the help of Tom Vilsack, I put out a rural plan. We should be encouraging you all to put more land in land conservation and to maintain. And get paid to do it because you absorb carbon from the air in carbon sinks. You should get paid to do that. We should be buying from farmers product they have now that they’re happy to just get rid of. We should be making sure that we have all the PPE that is needed to keep open the slaughterhouses and the chicken … We call them hanging chickens here in the Delmarva peninsula. It’s a small version of a slaughter house. Well, guess what? It was always a dangerous job. It was always a dangerous job. But now, now look what’s happening. Look where these outbreaks are taking place. So there’s a lot we can do, I think, to get us to the place where we can begin to rebuild by sustaining. Sustaining employment for people who in fact are in businesses that they cannot hire their employees, keep them on. Because right now on that program that exists that’s not getting out there. That if you keep a worker on your payroll, that is you get the money from the federal government to do that. And it is not a loan. It is flat out deductible. You do not have to pay that back. And now the main street program that the Congressman’s talking about, you’ll also be able to keep those businesses open so they can keep the lights on. So they don’t get foreclosed on their mortgage, or can’t pay their rent payment. And you talked about housing. I didn’t even talk about housing yet, but it is a giant problem. We’re now in a situation where why in fact do people want to … They get raised in a community like your county, sir, Ron, and they don’t want to leave. But where are the jobs? What happens? And where’s the housing? How do they do it? And there’s a lot we can do. I’m going to send each of you, because I don’t want to keep you much longer, a copy of my housing proposal and how we can get farmers. Small farmers. Keep them healthy and get new farmers into the business of farming. And I know there’s a lot more to talk about, but I’d rather hear from you than me. What you do for me, one of the reasons I’ve been doing these things with the Congressman and others around the country, is it gives me an insight that I’d ordinarily get if I was in your community. I’d be visiting the hospital to begin with. I’d be visiting your health services facility to begin with. I’d be talking to you and I’d be with you and talking about the farmer’s union and what the problems are. I’d be out talking about small businesses, how we keep them open. And this is the way in the midst of this crisis to be able to keep me informed so that I hear directly from all of you. But I’ll end by saying that my dad used to have an expression. He’d say, “Joey a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about, it’s about your pride. It’s about decency. It’s about your ability to be able to hold your head up in the community. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, ‘Honey, it’s going to be okay.’ It’s more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity.” And so many people are being deprived of their dignity. How in God’s name a mom or a dad to turn and look at a child that needs healthcare and they no longer have access to it until they do. Or how when a kid comes in, and you have friends this has happened to, “Mom, dad, I love to stay but there’s nothing here. I’m going to move to Madison. I’m going to move to … I’m moving to the city.” That’s not a sensible way for us to do our business. It doesn’t need to be this way. And if we lose the heart of the community we’re going to find ourselves, and that’s rural the community, we’re going to be in real trouble. Real, real trouble. But it’s time farmers start to get a fair share again. And part of that is if we … I’ll end by saying that we talked about infrastructure. Think of how many schools in your communities, they’re not sure whether or not they can turn and drink the water from the water fountain or whether or not they can breathe the air. Or they’re being told to duck and cover when they go to second grade, how to deal with a mass shooting. I mean, think about what’s going on in education right now. We propose, I propose, a hundred billion dollars for infrastructure for all of our schools across the nation. Build them back up. Make them accessible, make them clean. Make them safe, make them schools that are as good as any school that’s in a metropolitan area, or in an area where there’s a high tax base. Think about what we could be doing in terms of we have to rebuild our highways to meet the new standard based on the environment. Well, we ought to be able to put in over 500,000 charging stations, along our highways, new and old. We can own, we can own the electric vehicle market, creating millions and millions of good paying jobs. Making sure that people have access. We can now. We’ve learned how the science … We’ve learned how all that manure that’s out there in Delaware, the chicken manure, is a gigantic issue because it’s having real impact on the health of the Chesapeake Bay, for example, on the tributaries. We’ve now learned how we can pelletize that. We can take out the hydrogen and we can build these small factories in all our areas that employ somewhere between 10 and 15 people at a good pain salary to pelletize. It uses fertilizer that does not pollute. There’s so many things that we can do to build up rural America. And just talk about whether or not the President is keeping his commitment, dealing with the promise what he’s going to do relative to ethanol. And I mean, there’s, there’s a lot that’s out there that we can do that’s not being done. And I don’t quite get why the President has walked away from any responsibility to do it. Yeah, go ahead. Excuse me. Mr. Vice President, that to me sounds like a great wrap up statement for a wonderful round table discussion today. I’m sure you join me in thanking Mary and Rob and Darren for your participation today. All that feedback was terrific. And Mr. Vice President, Joe, we thank you for your past leadership. We are in desperate need of your future leadership, as you can help lead us out of this pandemic and the recovery that our nation is in desperate need of. So thank you for the generosity with your time today and for visiting us here in Wisconsin. Well, look, I’m going to send to each of you a contact point. You can get to me directly. If there’s any follow-up questions you have for me or ideas today or two months from now, let me know. For real, for real. This is the way that Ron and I have to learn these days because we can’t be with you. We can’t be in your community right now, but the bad news for you all is I’m coming. I’m coming. But anyway, thank you all so very, very much. And Ron, thank you, pal. You’re the best. I really mean it. Thank you. Thank you. Stay healthy everyone. Please stay safe."
"75","05-27-20"," President even supports it, but absent something like that, our teachers are frontline workers. They’re not going to have the jobs that we need them to have. They are our frontline workers. They’re the ones who are protecting us and keeping us. They’re the ones who are teaching our kids and we cannot stop the education process right now. All those things are really important and none of those things can take place if we don’t get the help we need from the federal government. The Heroes Act actually is out there. And the really good thing that will keep all 50 states and however many territories, five territories from acting counter to what the federal government is doing with the Cares Act. It is really important that we do this. It’s important for the most vulnerable or fellow Pennsylvanians, that we allow teachers to keep on teaching, that we give the frontline healthcare workers what they need to keep on working again, serving us, police officers, the firefighters, all those folks. We cannot do without them and they can’t survive unless they get the help that is in something like the Heroes Act. I mean, I can do all and will continue to work for a higher minimum wage, for better access to childcare, for paid family leave, for worker safety. I think the pandemic has given some real opportunity to make sure that when someone goes to work they’re safe. You made the absolutely the right point saying people have to have confidence because nothing that any employer does reopening or any governor does is going to do anything. If an employee does not or a worker does not feel safe going back to work. There is nothing that any of us can do if a student doesn’t feel safe going back to school or shopper going back to being a customer somewhere. All those things are really important. And again, this is where working at the federal level, things like the Heroes Act, leadership like the kind of leadership you would provide, I think is so important to all of us right now. Well, you know, I think the house has done a pretty good job and the Congress, in the Cares Act and in the Heroes Act. But for example, you in Pennsylvania, big state, 2 million, Pennsylvanian’s have filed for unemployment in recent weeks. There are school bus drivers, restaurant workers, hairdressers, manufacturing workers, often low wage workers, folks struggling to enter or hold onto their place in the middle class, if they’ve even made it. Tell me about the unemployment claims you’re seeing in Pennsylvania. And what industries and income levels, et cetera. How do you think we should be thinking job creation and dealing with … Because all the studies show a lot of work that Gene Sperling has done as our economic advisor in the last administration points out that one of the problems is the longer someone is unemployed, the less likely they’re ever going to get a job, because there is just sort of a intuitive prejudice that two people with the same resume applying for the same job, one who’s been out of work for six to eight months and one who’s been out of work a month. The one has been out of work a month, gets the job because there’s an implicit notion there must be something that’s a problem for the person who’s been out of work longer. How do you think we should be thinking about a job creation? But even before that, that’s a tough, I mean, that’s a really broad question. Not that you could answer any question, but when you seem to have been able to move faster than other states like Florida and others, in terms of getting the unemployment money out, the unemployment checks to people, get them out to process them. How difficult was it because you have this incredible deluge of people on a system that isn’t designed to handle that many people. Talk to me a little bit about how you were able to do it and I guess you’re still, you got about 80% of them out now who’ve applied. I think that’s the number. I may be wrong. Talk to me a little about that. It’s been tough. I mean, we had, I think a two and a half times the largest influx of first-time claims in our history and we were swamped. We I think had 500 people in our call center, unemployment compensation when this started. We’re now on our way to 13, 1400 people working there and do the processing. We also have first time unemployment benefits going out to gig workers and the gig economy and self-employed folks. There are a lot of real challenges and we have been swamped. I think what we did was to take it very seriously. We still have a ways to go to do a good job. We’re getting close to 80%, as you pointed out, in terms of getting claims out. Some of those claims are just held up because of some unusual things that, checking social security numbers and all that kind of stuff. But we are trying our best because we recognize that if we don’t do a good job here, all the other stuff we do is not going to mean a whole lot. We’ve got to get this money out. And so we are working night and day, seven days a week to make sure we are getting the money out. Two more questions. I know we both have to go. You have to go you’re governor, you’ve got a real job out there to take care of. But one of the things I wanted to ask is that when they passed the unemployment insurance bill, that the house did, they increase the maximum payment by $600, up to an income of 50 some thousand dollars you can be reimbursed. And they actually put in over half a billion dollars to help states accommodate the inflow that was coming, with almost now close to 40 million people, nationally 38, I forget the exact number. It keeps changing every day. Seeking unemployment, including gig workers, which we pushed very hard. I’ve worked with, I don’t take credit for it, but I spent a lot of time with Nancy and with Chuck Schumer about who we think should be in the legislation. But a lot of states have had difficulty getting enough people transfer from other departments into the department that distributes this and makes judgments on unemployment claims. Well, we have had a very collegial cabinet right from the beginning. And so it was not that hard. We’ve done what you just said. We have a lot of people moving from different agencies. We’ve also brought people back from retirement, but from all over the Commonwealth agencies that are not quite as busy as they might’ve been before the pandemic hit, they actually can’t afford to send workers over to labor and industry where there really is a big need for workers. The training period is between two and three weeks so there is some lag in terms of bringing people in and getting them trained up to the stuff. We are continually working on upgrading our computer system because the one that we entered this pandemic with is not as great as it should be, but the fact that the agencies are working together in this collaborative fashion, it’s really been a big resource for Pennsylvania. No. I mean, I participate in all the governor’s calls but I find them much more of a taker than a giver. I think it’s the kind of thing that every governor out there is trying to do the best for their states and that’s what I’m trying to do in Pennsylvania. I know when I was in college and graduate school, plagiarism was wrong, but I’m plagiarizing left and right from the good ideas from all the other governors and all the other states and nations around the world. I think there are a lot of things that people have tried that work and I think we ought to be open to those things. And luckily I’m surrounded by people in Pennsylvania and the leaders in my agencies who recognize that and are willing to take new ideas and run with them. You picked a lot of good people, some of whom are friends of mine. I know pretty well, but I really mean it. It’s a matter of making sure that you surround yourself with people who are competent, smart and know what they’re doing and you’ve done that. Look, I have a lot more questions. One of the things I want to do is not now, I know we have to go, but I have an idea about what I think we should be doing between now and the end of the election, which I can’t very much control right now. But how I would put together the country, if I am fortunate enough to be elected president and what I’d do on January 21st of 2021. It’s about a work plan and how to rebuild and how to regenerate an opportunity not to build back, but to build better because you and I talked a little bit, everything from childcare to making sure we spend that $20 billion in been trying to get spent for broadband so that every kid in rural Laverne County has the same access to home learning as the kid in central Philadelphia does. And to get all those things that we can be doing to create good jobs, not just the $15 an hour job, which I fully support your effort in doing, and it has to happen, but jobs where people are making a prevailing wage. We’re investing billions of dollars in infrastructure and improving our whole economy. But one of the things that, and I want to be able to send that to you and talk, not that you don’t have a full time job already, but I’d talk it over because I think it’s a lot of things you’ve been talking about. We don’t have time to do it now, but one of the things that I want to end with is that I really think that it’s important that we let people know that there’s nothing this country’s ever been unable to do when we’ve done it together. I mean, that sounds like hyperbole, but we’re an incredible, incredible country. One of the things that I see Tom, and I see it … The old joke was that people used to say that arc that goes into Pennsylvania, “in Delaware.” I had somebody once say “The best part of Delaware’s in Pennsylvania.” It’s not, we have a whole state, but my point is, we’re very close. I want to remind you that Delaware used to be part of Pennsylvania. That’s right. But we declared our independence on December the seventh, by the way. And it’s not just D-Day. Anyway, but look, one of the things that I think is really important is that we somehow put that back on. That somehow that we’re in a situation where we work together. And I think what’s happened is, as I’ve observed, particularly in the Tri state area here in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, which the old joke used to be and I was very proud of the joke that Biden was Pennsylvania’s third Senator for a long time. But all kidding aside because I’m from Scranton. But look, one of the things is that I think, when I announced I was running, I said that over a year ago, now that I wanted to restore the soul of the nation. I think we’re seeing the soul of the nation. We’re seeing all these people, that in fact are doing heroic things for other people. The way we’re pulling together, the sacrifices people are making, the lives being lost saving other people’s lives, the way in which people have stepped up. And I’m absolutely confident that we’re going to get through this. The approaching 100,000 people have lost their lives and left behind family is going to be really, really, really hard for them, but we will get through it all. But one of the things that I think is the most important thing is we’ve got to be in a position where we acknowledge what we’ve seen this country is capable of. And it’s not enough, in my view, that we as I said, build back, we got to build back better. And I think the blinders have been taken off a whole lot of people out there, not people who were prejudiced or anything, but people who just didn’t understand how important that grocery store clerk was. Didn’t understand that nurse who early on had to take out a plastic garbage bag and put it over her because she didn’t have the proper protective equipment. The people, the cop who shows up in a car crash, and doesn’t worry about a burning car, pull somebody out, doesn’t ask whether they’re Muslim or they’re black or they’re white or Asian or anything else, just goes ahead and does it. I mean, the way people have stepped up across the board, and I think they’re ready that to change the system. I think they’re ready to do essentially what happened with Roosevelt, that they can through a depression and came out stronger. We came out with social security. We came out with unions. We came out with a whole range of things. I think we can do that again, but I know how busy you are and you have to get back to work, but I promise you that if and when I’m President, I promise I’ll have your back, we’ll work together. And for working families and small businesses and they’re the people we should be focusing on now. Not one single dollar of age should be gone to a major corporation now, if you’re going to small businesses. It should be going to keep families on a payroll. It should be going to make sure people, in fact have the basic necessities they need. And I think that we’ll get through, I know we’ll get through this. I think we can come out stronger. And because of folks like you, who are real leaders and Tom, you’ve done one hell of a job. And I just want to thank you for taking the time to be with me and hope we’ll keep in touch like we have. Let’s keep in touch and thank you. Thank you. I’m proud to be a supporter. I’m a supporter as well of you as you know. All right, well, thanks an awful lot folks. And I look forward to talking to more of our governors, with more of our governors and this is not a … Wearing one of these masks when you’re outside, it’s not a partisan issue. The secret service outside my house here, they all have the masks on. We don’t talk. We don’t talk unless I walk out with a mask on. It is a matter of protecting other people, not just yourself, other people. That’s what this is about. So thanks. Thanks again, gov. Appreciate it. Thanks. Thanks Joe."
"76","05-29-20"," An act of brutality so elemental, it did more than deny one more black man in America his civil rights and his human rights. It denied him of his very humanity. It denied him of his life. Depriving George Floyd as it deprived Eric Garner, one of the things, every human being must be able to do, breathe, so simple, so basic, so brutal. With the same thing happened with Aubrey. The same thing happened with Brianna Taylor. The same thing with George Floyd. We’ve spoken their names aloud. We’d cried them out in pain and in horror. We chiseled them into a long suffering hearts. They’re the latest additions to the endless list of stolen potential wiped out unnecessarily. It’s a list that dates back more than 400 years; black men, black women, black children, the original sin of this country still stains our nation today. And sometimes we manage to overlook it. We just pushed forward with a thousand other tasks in our daily life, but it’s always there. And weeks like this, we see it plainly, that we’re a country with an open wound. None of us can turn away. None of us can be silent. None of us can any longer can we hear the words I can’t breathe and do nothing. We can’t fail victims like what Martin Luther King called “The appalling silence of good people.” Every day African-Americans go about their lives with a constant anxiety and trauma wondering who would be next? Imagine if every time your husband or son, wife or daughter left the house, you feared for their safety from bad actors and bad police. Imagine if you had to have that talk with your child about not asserting your rights, taking the abuse handed out to them just so they could make it home. Imagine having police called on you just for sitting in Starbucks or renting an Airbnb or watching birds. This is the norm black people in this country deal with. They don’t have to imagine it. The anger and frustration and the exhaustion, it’s undeniable, but that’s not the promise of America. It’s long past time that we made the promise of this nation real for all people. This is no time for incendiary tweets. It’s no time to encourage violence. This is a national crisis. We need real leadership right now, leadership that will bring everyone to the table so we can take measures to root out systemic racism. It’s time for us to take a hard look at the uncomfortable truths. It’s time for us to face that deep open wound we have in this nation. We need justice for George Floyd. We need real police reform that hold cops to a higher standard that so many of them actually meet. That holds bad cops accountable then repairs relationship between law enforcement and the community they’re sworn to protect. We need to stand up as a nation with the black community, with all minority communities, and come together as one America. That’s the challenge we face. It’s going to require those of us who sit in some position of influence to finally deal with the abuse of power. The pain is too immense for one community to bear alone. I believe it’s the duty of every American to grapple with it and to grapple with it now. With our complacency and our silence, we are complicit in perpetuating these cycles of violence. Nothing about this will be easy or comfortable, but do we simply allow this wound to scab over once more without treating the underlying injury, we’ll never truly heal. The very soul of America is at stake. We must commit as a nation to pursue justice with every ounce of our being. We have to pursue it with real urgency. We’ve got to make real, the promise of America, which we’ve never fully grasped. That all men and women are equal. Not only in creation, but throughout their lives. Again, to George’s family, thanks for taking the time to talk to me. I promise you, I promise you, we’ll do everything in our power to see to it that justice is had for your brother, your cousin’s case. God love y’all. Folks, we got to stand up. We got to move. We got to change. It’s always been here. It’s always been here. We just haven’t came together yet, but I’m starting to feel it. I’m starting to feel it. I’m starting to feel it. And I thank God for everybody here, but we came for justice. We came for convictions. I definitely came because this city is definitely going to take care of my brother’s kids. He has two beautiful daughters that he can’t provide for. Two nights ago I’m on the phone with Roxy. Gigi don’t even know. She still ain’t told her daughter so she decides to tell her while I’m on the phone."
"77","06-02-20"," Mr. Mayor, thanks for your hospitality. And to all the elected officials that are here, I’m bringing you greetings. “I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe.” George Floyd’s last words, but they didn’t die with him. They’re still being heard echoing all across this nation. They speak to a nation where too often, just the color of your skin, puts your life at risk. They speak to a nation where more than 100,000 people have lost their lives to the virus, and 40 million have filed for unemployment with the disproportionate number of those deaths in job losses, concentrated in black and Brown communities. And they speak to a nation where every day, millions of people, millions, not at the moment of losing their life, but in the course of living their life are saying to themselves, “I can’t breathe. It’s a wake up call to our nation, in my view, it’s for all of us, and I mean all of us. It’s not the first time we’ve heard those words. They’re the same words we heard from Eric Garner when his life was taken away six years ago. But it’s time to listen to those words, to try to understand them, to respond to them, respond with action. Our country is crying out for leadership, leadership that can unite us, leadership that brings us together, leadership that can recognize pain and deep grief of communities that have had a knee on their neck for a long time. There’s no place for violence, no place for looting or destroying property or burning churches or destroying businesses. Many of them built by the very people of color who for the first time in their lives are beginning to realize their dreams and build wealth for their families, nor is it acceptable for our police sworn to protect and serve all people to escalate tension resort to excessive violence. We need to distinguish between legitimate, peaceful protest and opportunistic violent destruction. We have to be vigilant about the violence that’s being done by this incumbent president to our economy and to the pursuit of justice. When peaceful protestors dispersed in order for a president, a president, from the doorstep of the people’s house, the white house, using tear gas and flash grenades in order to stage a photo op, a photo op, in one of the most historic churches in the country, or at least in Washington, DC. We can be forgiven for believing the president is more interested in power than in principle. We’re just serving the passions of his base than the needs of the people in his care. For that’s what the presidency is, the duty to care, to care for all of us, not just those who vote for us, but all of us, not just our donors, but all of us. The president held up the Bible at St. John’s church yesterday. I just wish he opened it once in a while instead of brandishing it. If he opened it, he could have learned something. We’re all called to love one another as we love ourselves, it’s really hard work, but it’s the work of America. Donald Trump isn’t interested in doing that work, instead he’s preening and sweeping away all the guard rails, the law that protected our democracy, guardrails that have helped make possible this nation’s path to more perfect union, a union that constantly requires reform and rededication. And yes, the protest from voices that are mistreated, ignored, left out or left behind, but it is a union, a union worth fighting for? And that’s why I’m running for president. In addition to the Bible, the president might also want to open the US constitution once in a while. If he did, he’d find a thing called the first amendment and what it says in the beginning, it says the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition their government for redress and grievances. It’s kind of an essential notion building into this country. Mr. President that’s America, that’s America. No horses rising up on their hind legs to push back peaceful protest, not using the American military to move against the American people. This is a nation of values. Our freedom to speak is a cherished knowledge that lives inside every American, almost from the time you’re a kid. We’re not allowing any president to quiet our voice. We won’t let those who see this as an opportunity to sow chaos, throw up a smoke screen, to distract us from real legitimate grievances at the heart of these protests. We can’t, we can’t leave this moment, we can’t leave this moment thinking that we can once again turn away and do nothing. We can’t do that this time. We just can’t. The moment has come for our nation to deal with systemic racism, to deal with the growing economic inequity that exists in our nation, to deal with the denial of the promise of this nation made to so many. I’ve said from the outset of this election, that we’re in the battle for the soul of this nation, and we are in the battle for the soul of this nation. When we believe it may be most importantly, who we want to be, it’s all stake as truer today than it has ever been at least in my lifetime. And it’s this urgency, it’s in this urgency we can find a path forward. The history of this nation teaches us that in some of our darkest moments of despair, we’ve made some of our greatest progress. Some of our darkest moments, the 13th, 14th, 15th amendments followed the civil war. The greatest economic growth in world history grew out of the great depression. Civil Rights Act of 1964 and ’60, the Voting Rights Act of ’65 came in the tracks of Bull Connors vicious dogs. To paraphrase Reverend Barber, “It’s the morning we find hope. It’s in the morning we find hope when we mourn.” But it’s going to take more than talk. We had talked before, we had protest before, we’ve got to now vow to make this at least an era of action and reverse the systemic racism with a long overdue concrete changes. The action will not be completed in the first hundred days of my presidency, if I’m fortunate enough to be elected, or even in my entire term. It’s going to take the work of a generation. But if this agenda will take time to complete, it should not wait for the first hundred days of my presidency to get started. A down payment on what is long overdue should come now, should come immediately. I call on the Congress to act this month on measures that will be the first step in this direction, starting with real police reform. Congressman Jeffries has a Bill to outlaw choke Kohl’s. Congress should put it on the president’s desk in the next few days. There are other measures, to stop transferring weapons of war to police forces, improve oversight and accountability, to create a model use of force standard, that also should be made law this month. No more excuses, no delays. If Mitch McConnell can bring in the United States Senate to confirm Trump’s on qualified judicial nominees who will run rough shot over our constitution, now it’s time to pass legislation that will give true meaning to our constitutional promise of equal protection under the law. Looking ahead in the first hundred days of my presidency, I’ve committed to creating a national police oversight commission. I’ve long believed we need real community policing. We need each and every police department in the country to understand a comprehensive review of their undertaking, a comprehensive review of their hiring, their training, their deescalation. Some have already done it, some are in the process of doing it. The federal government should give, give the cities, the States the tools and the resources they need to implement reforms. More police officers meet the higher standards of their procession, most of them do it. All the more reason why bad cops should be dealt with severely and swiftly. We all need to take a hard look at the culture that allows for the senseless tragedies to keep happening. And we need to learn from the cities and the precincts that are getting it right. We know though, in order to have true American justice, we need economic justice as well. Here too, is there’s much to be done. As an immediate step, Congress should act now to rectify racial inequities that allow COVID-19 recovery funds to be diverted from where they live. I’ll be setting forth my agenda in economic justice and opportunity in the weeks and months ahead, but it begins with healthcare. Healthcare should be a right, not a privilege. The quickest route to universal coverage in this country is to expand on Obamacare. We can do it, we should do it. But this president, even now, in the midst of a public health crisis with a massive unemployment, well, wants to destroy it. He doesn’t care how many millions of Americans will be hurt because he’s consumed with this blinding ego when he comes to the Barack Obama, president Obama. The president should withdraw his lawsuit to strike down Obamacare and the Congress should prepare to pass the Act I proposed to expand Obamacare to millions more so everyone is covered. This last few months, we’ve seen America’s true heroes, healthcare workers, docs, nurses, delivery truck drivers, grocery store workers. We’ve come up with a new phrase for them, essential workers, essential workers. We need to do more than praise them. We need to pay them. We need to pay them because we weren’t clear before, it’s clear now. This country wasn’t built by wall street bankers and CEOs. It was built by the great American middle class, which is built by unions and our essential workers. I know there’s enormous fear and uncertainty and anger in the country. I understand. I know so many Americans are suffering, suffering loss of a loved one, suffering economic hardship, wondering can I feed my family tomorrow? What’s going to happen? Suffering under the weight of a generation after generation, after generation, of hurt and inflicted on people of color, on black, brown and native communities in particular. Like many of you, I know what it means to grieve. My losses are not the same as losses felt by so many, but I know what it feels like when you think you can’t go on. I know what it means to have that black hole in your chest where your grief is being sucked into it. Just a few days ago, marked the fifth anniversary of my son Beau’s passing of cancer. And there’s still moments when the pain is so great, it no different than the day I sat in that bed as he passed away. But I also know that the best way to bear loss and pain is to turn it into, that anger and anguish into purpose. And Americans know what our purpose is as a nation, it has to be guided, it has to be guided, it’s guided us from the very beginning. It’s been reported the day that president John F. Kennedy was assassinated, little Yolanda King came home from school and jumped in her daddy’s arms and said, “Oh daddy,” she said, “Now we’re never going to get our freedom.” Through daddy was reassuring, strong and brave, he said, “No, don’t worry, baby. It’s going to be okay. It’s going to be all right.” Amid the violence and fear, Dr. King, he persevered. He was driven by his dream, of a nation where justice runs down like water and righteousness like a mighty stream. Then in 1968, hate cut him down in Memphis. Two days before Dr. King was murdered, he gave a final Sunday sermon to Washington, where he told us that though the arc of the moral universe is long, he said it bends towards justice. And we know we can bend it because we have, we have to believe that’s still, that’s our purpose. It’s been our purpose in the very beginning, to become a nation where all men and women are not only created equal, but they’re treated equally, not just created equal, but treated equally, to become a nation, to find in Dr. King’s words, not only by the absence of tension, but by the presence of justice. It’s not enough just to not have tension, but justice. Today in America is hard to keep faith that justice is at hand. I know that, you know that. Pain is raw. The pain is real. The president of United States must be part of the solution, not the problem, but this president today is part of the problem and accelerates it. When he twitted the words, “When the looting starts, the shooting starts,” they weren’t the words of the president, they were words of a racist Miami police chief in the 60s. When he tweeted that “Protestors would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, when people would have been really hurt.” They weren’t the words of a president. They were the kind of words Bull Connor would have used unleashing his dogs on innocent women and children. The American story is a story about action and reaction. That’s what actually works. We can’t be naive about it. I wish I could say that hate began with Donald Trump and will end with him. It didn’t, and it won’t. American history isn’t a fairy tale with a guaranteed happy ending. The battle for the soul of this nation has been a constant push and pull for more than 240 years, a tug of war between the American ideal that we’re all created equal, and the harsh reality that racism has long torn us apart. The honest truth is that both elements are part the American character, both elements. At our best, the American ideal wins out. But it’s never a route, it’s always a fight and the battle is never fully won. But we can’t ignore the truth that we’re at our best when we open our hearts rather than to clench our fist. Donald Trump has turned this country into battlefield [inaudible 00:19:39] by old resentments and fresh fears. He thinks division helps him. His narcissism has become more important than the nation’s wellbeing that he leads. I ask every American, I mean this in the bottom of my heart, ask every American, look at where we are now and think a new. Is this who we are? Is this who we want to be? Is this we want to pass onto our children and our grandchildren, fear, anger, finger pointing rather than the pursuit of happiness? Incompetence and anxiety, self absorption, selfishness? Or do we want to be the America we know we can be? The America we know in our hearts, we could be and should be. Look, I look at the presidency as a very big job and nobody will get it right every time, and I won’t either, but I promise you this I won’t traffic in fear and division. I won’t fan the flames of hate. I’ll seek to heal the racial wounds that have long plagued country, not use them for political gain. I’ll do my job and I will take responsibility. I won’t blame others. I’ll never forget. I will never forget. I promise you. This job is not about me, it’s about you, it’s about us. I worked not only to rebuild a nation, but to build it better than it was, we are the only nation in the world that goes through a crisis and comes out better. To build a better future, that’s what America does, to build a better future. We build a future. It may in fact be the most American thing to do, build the future. We hunger for liberty the way Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglas did. We thirst for the vote like Susan B. Anthony and Ella Baker and John Lewis did. We strive to explore the stars, cure disease, make an imperfect union more perfect than is been. We may come up short, but at our best we try. My fellow Americans, we’re facing a formidable enemies. They include not only the Coronavirus and a terrible impact on the lives and livelihoods, but also the selfishness and fear that have loomed over our national life for the last three years. And I choose those words advisedly, selfishness, and fear. Defeating those enemies requires us to do our duty. And that duty includes remembering who we should be, who we should be. We should be the America of FDR and Eisenhower, of Rosa parks and Martin Luther King Jr. Of Joan and Neil Armstrong. We should be the America that cherishes life, liberty, and courage, and above all, we should be the America that cherishes each other. Each and every one of us. We’re a nation in pain. We must not let our pain destroy us. We’re a nation enraged. We cannot let our rage consume us. We’re a nation that’s exhausted, but we will not allow our exhaustion defeat us. As president, is my commitment to all of you to lead on these issues and to listen, because I truly believe in my heart of hearts, we can overcome. When we stand together finally as one America, we will rise stronger than we were before. We’ll move that arc closer to justice. We’ll reach out to one another. So speak out for one another and please, please, to what’s recently been happening, take care of one another. This is the United States of America. There’s never been anything we’ve been unable to do when we set our mind to do it and we’ve done it together. Together, united, that’s what we are at our best. May God bless you all and may God protect our troops. Thank you."
"78","06-11-20"," [inaudible 00:00:29]. [inaudible 00:04:38]. Thank you all for being here. Before we begin, as a reminder, this event today has been set up to adhere to the social distancing guidelines as provided by the health experts. Due to those six feet social distancing restrictions, the vice president will not take individual photos today, but at the conclusion of the event, we will provide instructions for a group photo. Thank you again for being here. That’s assuming you’d want one. Thank you, vice president, for coming here in the third congressional district in one of the most fantastic places in the city and in the state. I think that basically you will see today and hear from all these fantastic people some great stories. They’re residents of West Philadelphia. That’s where you are, in this area. And they just have, I was just talking to them in the back, and they have some fantastic things to talk about. I think this is a great opportunity you have to hear. And Tiffany, who I told her don’t be bashful. The vice president doesn’t bite you. I told her, don’t be bashful. You just speak your mind. So Tiffany, you want to start? Tell him what you was telling me in the back room when you was saying the vice president. Hi Tiffany. I am wonderful. So as Congressman Evans said, my name is Tiffany Easley. I am the owner of [inaudible 00:06:11] Eyewear, which is a full service optical store in West Philadelphia. As well as having my business in West Philadelphia. I’m also a resident of West Philadelphia. We’ve been in operation now for about three and a half years. So are my grand daughters. Yeah. Okay. Okay. We’ve been in operations for about three and a half years now, and I have a lot of ideas of what should happen in West Philadelphia, as far as small businesses. I’d like to hear them. Looking forward to hearing them. Tamika, [inaudible 00:06:49]. Tamika also is on the front line. I would deem her as the essential worker in what she does. And she’s in a very proud union that does a lot for this city and this country. And I’ve had the opportunity just listening to Tamika’s story and the things. Hi Tamika. My name is Tamika Anderson. I’m an essential worker. I work downtown at 15th street, the One Liberty Place Cleaning. I also live in West Philly. So basically, I’m here just to find out what can be done different so things won’t happen the way that they’re happening now. Vice president, here’s someone who’s not a stranger. We have known each other for, I won’t say how many years, but we’ve known each other a lot. I would like for her, in addition to talking about the enterprise center, is give you a little history of this location, so the vice president has a little feel of you, Della. I could never dance well, Della. Well, Congressman Evans, he’s probably too young to know anything about American bandstand. Thank you. I love you. I know everything except I couldn’t dance. You are sitting in the birthplace of American bandstand. This was the first building built in our country as a television station from the ground up by Walter Annenberg. And at that time, he owned the Philadelphia Inquiry, and he owned the letters, WFIL, which is now at Six City Avenue. And Dick Clark used to stand right in front of that mural, and this is where the bleachers used to be. And this literally was the dance floor. And my last name happened to be Clark. So I took a picture around this building and said that Dick was my first husband and it was before integration. And I ended up with the building. And I am pleased to tell you we’ve been in this building 23 years. And when we moved in 23 years ago, we opened up our doors without any debt, because I was able to convince the business, the federal government and state and city that we couldn’t afford to open up our doors with debt because we knew we could not be financially induced by our pressure that we couldn’t help minority entrepreneurs. And the organization is 30 years old and I’ve been here 28 years of the 30 years. And you’ve done a heck of a job. Well, I knew, vice president, that when I walked into the enterprise center, that it was God’s assignment in my life, and I’m staying here until my job is done. Wow. If I have nothing to do with it, your job’s going to be made easier, not harder. I hope so. I’ll give you some orders before I leave. I don’t have any doubt about that. I don’t have any doubt about that. What I’d like to do is, first of all, thank you all. And do we have copies of what I’m, you’ve gotten it. Okay. Look, the National Bureau of Labor Statistics points out there’s 3.3 million business owners have shut their doors since February, 3.3 million. And God willing, a lot will open up again, but 41% of African American businesses have shut their doors, 32% of Latino businesses and 19% of white businesses. And Trump may have forgotten about coronavirus, but it hasn’t forgotten about us. And we have 20 million unemployed. You all know that. And the failure to respond to the pandemic, I think the federal government has abdicated any effective leadership role, the white house at least has abdicated that role. The rapidly rising with… I don’t know, his just inability to focus on any federal responsibility, him saying, I take no responsibility. It’s not my problem. I don’t have this responsibility. But what I’ve laid out here for you is the outlines of a major, a much larger initiative that I hope, if elected and before elected, if that occurs, that we’re going to be able to do. And so we have to give guidance, it seems to me, better guidance than we’ve been able to give. And so what I talk about here is Trump has basically had a one point plan. Open businesses, just open. But it does nothing to keep workers safe and keep businesses able to stay open. And secondly, it has done very little to generate consumer confidence. A lot of businesses that are ready to open also find themselves positioned that the customers aren’t coming. They don’t have the confidence that they’re ready and safe. And so I lay out here, and I don’t want to get too wonky here, but how I think we should approach it and what responsibility I think the federal government has to begin to deal with us getting out of this dark hole we’re in. And the first one is to, which we’ve been saying for a long time, Dwight’s been saying it as well. And that is you got to guarantee testing, and you got to guarantee the availability of personal protective equipment, and for anybody called back on the job, period. And it has component parts. Direct the federal government to provide regular and reliable COVID-19 tests for every worker called back to work. They should be able to be tested and paid for by the federal government. The federal government pay for all of the testing, and make it available that they have rapid results. And for the duration of this crisis, be able to continue to do that. Secondly, you got to ensure that all workers and all communities have access to effective personal protective equipment. We already now know we don’t have it. If there’s another bounce back here, we don’t have the equipment ready for this next occurrence if it bumps up. And you see the states now that are showing an increase in hospitalizations. And so you have to make sure we may have access to effective personal protective equipment across the board. And no workers should be forced to give up benefits and return to work in unsafe conditions unless they’re able to have the protective gear available to them. And third part of that guarantee in testing and personal protective equipment is we have to ensure workers and unions have a voice in reopening plans. These decisions by tribal governments as well. I’ve laid out a detailed plan, which we won’t go into now, but we have to be able to deal… I think we should establish, and I will establish what we call a pandemic testing board, not unlike what Roosevelt did in a different circumstance, a national testing board during the depression, to surge testing nationwide and ramp up the production and fair distribution of the PPE. Federal government still isn’t taking responsibility for where that equipment goes, how it gets there. We should have, from the beginning, I think Dwight joined me, or I joined Dwayne three months ago saying we shouldn’t have essentially a commander. Just like all military equipment, there’s a supply officer who knows where it has to get, who needs it, where it goes. We need the same kind of supply officer nationally to know where the need is and what equipment is needed and how to get it to people that need that equipment. And parenthetically, I think we should be doing right now is were I in office, I would be taking $25 billion, putting essentially a vaccine czar in charge. When, God willing, we get this vaccine, how will it be distributed? Where will it go? How will it get there? How will we guarantee that it will be able to be distributed in a way that all Americans, all Americans have equal access to it? Because the same thing is going to happen. God willing, we get a vaccine, maybe one, if God was great, maybe even in the fall. I doubt it, but I hope it, but probably beginning of next year. Where does it go? We’re going to be faced with the same kind of dilemma, Dwight. How’s it get to whom? And how does it not get the way in which all the work you guys did in the Congress? All this legislation you passed, most of the help went to the very wealthy, went to the corporations, went to the people who are hanging out at Mar-a-Lago. They didn’t get to where it was designed to get. 40% of all the money for small businesses, only 40% of it got there. And then it didn’t get there in a way that I’m sure you can talk to, Tiffany and others can. So, that’s the first part of this. The second piece of this is I think we have to guarantee paid leave, federal paid leave for anyone who gets sick. And they shouldn’t have to choose between their paycheck and their health. And so what I would do, and I have it laid out here, is that I would ensure paid leave for all workers that get sick from COVID, and the paid leave would be paid for by the federal government and for as long as they need to recover and have a complete quarantine. And I’d also guarantee federally funded paid leave for workers caring for family members who have COVID, who are back home. They should be able to be off and not have to work. Now, I would also ensure, the third thing I would do, I’d ensure worker protection and accountability. Look, right now, some of you, I know anybody involved with labor knows about OSHA, and the Occupational Safety And Health Administration. And they have to set down and they should be setting down rigorous standards for the context in which it’s safe to reopen and how you reopen, in terms of not just social distancing, but in, for example, meat packing plants, slowing down the line so that people don’t have to rush and be closer together, making sure there’s plastic dividers, a whole range of them. But that’s the job of occupational health and safety. And they should doing it across the board to give advice to small businesses on how they can and should open. And so right now, we have to be in a position where there’s rigorous temporary standards protections for all the workers who go back, and we have to protect workers not fully covered by OSHA. We don’t cover some. For example, we don’t cover a lot of public employees directing other agencies and forces. Everyone should be covered by this who weren’t ordinarily covered during the period of this crisis. And we got to pursue tough fines for those larger businesses that don’t abide by the standards, or recklessly expose their workers to this. I’m beginning to get bored by my own talk here. But why don’t I, instead of going through all of this, why don’t we talk about, give me your sense of what you worry most about in going to work, opening and having to close, why you close and open your business, and what you think small businesses need the most help in? I’ll speak later to building a national contact tracing workforce. And we can do it quickly. Protecting older Americans and people with disabilities who have special needs, there’s things we can do. Providing technical assistance to small businesses from accounting capability, lawyers, the things that need to be able to get access to what is needed out there. We should have, for example, a safer shopper program. If in fact, a business abides by all the rules that are set out to enhance the probability that someone can walk in safely and everything is being met, they should be able to get a certificate, a safer shopper plastered on the window of the business that you can walk in. Because they’ve taken it all precautions that are rational and necessary in order to protect the safety of the customer. But there’s a lot of other things we can do, but why don’t you talk to me a little bit about what’s on your mind, what worries you most about your business? What worries you most about what’s happening to SCIU workers? And thank you for your national endorsement. I mean, you in fact are really up against it, so many folks. We should be, for example, having a circumstance where if we have the whole idea of the thing that the congressman did in terms of the CARES Act was to keep people employed. And so I proposed that we have not just an unemployment system, but an employment system insurance. So that, for example, if you have 25 workers and you only have enough work for 12, you keep them on the roll, all 25 on, you pay them half pay, and the federal go makes up the rest of the pay. So you’re able to keep the workforce in place throughout the time. And the whole idea is once you’re fired, once you’re laid off, once you leave, the longer you’re out, the harder it is to get reemployed later on, especially if in fact you’re a minority, if you’re black or brown. Businesses. Tamika, you heard what the vice president said to you when we was standing in the back room. This is your chance. Really. I’m anxious to hear it. She took her mask… Oh, go ahead. [inaudible 00:22:16]. Sure. You said that magic wand, and just regards to the pandemic and being a small business and having to open because the longer we stay closed I don’t make any money. I didn’t get a large funds for the PPP. I got what they told me that I could get, even though I was eligible for more. I am most afraid for my staff coming back. Most of my staff had newborn babies during this pandemic. So they’re more afraid to come back and contract the virus and take it back to their newborn babies. So what do I do when I don’t have any more PPP? I’ve dipped into my savings already. I have to open, so I can’t really open my store at 100% capacity because, me by myself, I can’t service everyone fairly and give them the service that they deserve. I can’t fire my employees because that’s my team. I appreciate them and I understand what’s going on, but what do I do when they have to stay home but I still have to open and I don’t have any more funds to be able to pay them to stay out, and I can’t work at full capacity to be able to have income come in to run my business the way that it should. So I think if you had a magic wand and if it was up to you and you were in place to do so, to make it a little bit easier for small businesses like mine, not small businesses like, and maybe I shouldn’t say names, but like the larger corporations that are considered small businesses, but to really make it easier for small businesses that have anywhere between 20 and less employees to have access to capital, to have access to some government funds to help you to continue to pay your employees, to help you to continue to stay open. Let me ask you a question. Originally, it was sis. Six. But how many at the… You’ve closed. I have two and I had to close one. Close one. The one that I had to close, it was three employees. Right. Absolutely not. Right. It did. I was able to get a grant and I was able to get a loan. I was able to get a loan from The Enterprise Center and I was able to get a grant from The Merchant Fund. They were small grants. And I know that it had to be spread around. I was blessed enough to be able to get those grants, but they were gone within a day because my bills exceed what I got. Yeah. Well, one of the things that Congress has been talking about and this new act they’ve passed and the Senate Republicans are holding out, is whether or not you are able to get, not just a loan for overhead, but a grant, that if you’re keeping people employed, then you get significantly more money to be able to deal with overhead cost. And that is everything from electricity to heating, air conditioning, open the doors, whatever. And that is not a loan. That would be a grant. One of the things that I propose here is that we don’t have very much information from a medical standpoint on what the impact of COVID is from a parent to a child or a newborn. And so, I propose we spend a fair amount of money in research focusing now, providing research now where NIH focuses on, zeroing in on what is the impact, what are the impacts on infants, on young children of parents who may be exposed to COVID at their work? Because they are scared to death, as you said, that, my Lord, last thing I want to do is go to work, I could be someone who is not showing any signs of having COVID and have it. And that’s why the testing is so important for those people coming back to work as well, being able to be tested. But with regard to the whole notion of whether or not you’re going to be able to restart a small business, one of the things that, as I indicated before, is that too much of the money in these programs has gone to big business. Most people don’t think 500 employees is a small business. Of course. And the mainstream businesses like yours that have fewer than 50 employees, fewer than 20 employees, some as few as 10 employees, they’re the ones that are getting crushed right now. And so, I think we have to have also technical assistance to be able to provide small businesses like yours with the ability to have access to accountants and lawyers and others to how you apply for, how you qualify for, how you in fact can take full advantage of what is out there that’s not being taken advantage now. And so, I really think that one of the things that we have to think about is this testing and tracing. That also is going to take a lot of pressure off of employees who are coming back to work to know when they go home they are going to not be taking it home to their family or they’re taking care of an elderly mom or they have a six month old baby. It requires also to have all the protective gear and the safety circumstances required for your particular business. Every business is slightly different. And so, tell me about your business. Tell me about dealing with the eyewear. We do. We’re a full-service. I have optometrists that come in, and it was hard trying to get them to come back. We did follow the CDC guidelines for optometrists. And because they work closely with the patient and then when the patient comes out, as an optician we work closely with the patient. So we have to be in close proximity to the person that we’re working with. So we do try to take temperatures. We do require everyone to wear a mask. We do have the hand sanitizers. Those things are running out, and it’s very hard to get. When I need the supplies of hand sanitizer, now I’m going to the store and a eight ounce bottle is $15. When I need to buy 10 bottles of that to last me throughout the month, because not only do I have to supply it for my employees, I also need to supply for my patients or my customers that also come in. Right. I think that should be covered by the Federal Government. I think they should be covered, too. I think it should be covered. But I’m serious. And under the way the law was written, it was intended that it be able to be covered. Correct. … what it is they could qualify for and what they can get. Capital. Capital. Yep. Well, before we leave Tiffany’s story, I want to make one point. I thought it was tied to it. I wasn’t trying to leave it. Yeah. She’s one of our clients. Okay. Okay, is that Tiffany is a good example of an entrepreneur that was working in what I would call pre-pandemic, the old economy. We’re now facing a economic reset and there’s going to be a new economy. And so an entrepreneur like Tiffany who required a place-based strategy of a client coming in her door to get glasses, and we had this conversation as we were waiting on you, is that she now needs to pivot to build a technology infrastructure for a e-commerce so that whether I go to her optometrist or not, I could send her my prescription, I can look online at her eyeglasses, and she can still generate revenue while we continue to figure out this COVID-19 pandemic and PPE, because she still needs to get business. But she doesn’t have the dollars now to invest in that technology platform that she needs in order to be ready for this new economy. Going back to your question and my response around capital, right, is that as you were driving to this building here and to this center, you entered into a distressed community. And so, one of my first orders, because I’m bossy, is that as you look at these distressed communities I’d like for you to change your lenses and look at them from a standpoint, how do I use my influence to convert them from distressed to prosperous? And how do we lay those strategically to accomplish that? And one of the biggest things in this distressed community is under supply of capital. Right? I would like to see Tiffany become multi-millionaire. Me too. Okay? Do acquisition. But we don’t have the capital as a service provider to invest in her. And we don’t want to be just debt lenders, we want to be also equity investors. So we need blended capital, right? Because right now, when Tiffany comes to us, all we can do is make her a loan. And what we’re doing, Vice President, is stacking on more debt, stacking on more debt. She’ll never be able to grow with debt. It puts her in a position of where she is a risk manager versus a growth manager. I got that. And that’s why this is not the totality of what I’ve done. As you probably know, I double the amount of money for this SBA and small business loans and I cut their interest rates on it. And you know all this stuff about that. I got another wand, too. Yeah. Well, I tell you what, well the other wand is that… But what I was trying to get at is the immediate concern this moment. Look, I see this in two phases. The first phase of this is how do we deal with the stimuli to keep the economy from completely crashing? And the second thing is, how do we then rebuild the economy? How do we reinvest in the things that are going to be the future? How are we going to bring people to a different place? And they require significant investment. Significant. For example, I call for over a trillion dollars in increased spending by the Federal Government on infrastructure, including dealing everything from housing to a whole range of things. And in addition where we should be moving in a direction that… Look, I’m the guy that managed the $830 billion handed out in our Administration and Recovery Act. And if you remember, you got a lot of it, and less than 2/10 of 1% was waste and fraud. But it requires a national plan, it requires a national coordination, and it requires to have a, the fancy word is used in Congress is that there should be someone who is able to look into all of this. In other words, somebody follows this every single day that’s independent of the president, independent of the Congress, says, “This isn’t being spent well.” Inspectors general. Well, guess what? This president’s fired every inspector general. First thing I’m going to do as President of the United States if I end up being President of the United States is hire an inspector general to go back and look at the entire two trillion dollars you guys appropriated and spend the time with a fine toothed comb going through who got it, who cheated, who in fact didn’t deserve it, and get it paid back and/or go after them for violations of the law if they violated. That includes a whole range and we got to build a new economy. For example, one of the things that is going to be necessary is for you to be in a position to be able to just, right now, if you just had the ability of consuming more telemarketing than what you have right now. I don’t know whether you have that capacity now. But what I’m talking about today is the immediate need to keep bread on the table, to keep people employed so that when the economy does begin to come back and we do all these larger things, which I’ll send you a 60 page copy of what I’m proposing, is that people are still alive, people are still running… We haven’t broken up more families. We haven’t put people in a position where they’re in debt for so long they can never get out. We haven’t put people in a position where they in fact have given up and become very depressed. For example, one of the big things we’re going to have to do, and I know you know it, is significantly increase access to mental health. Significantly increased access to mental health. Not just for African Americans, across the board. And so, there’s a whole range of those things. But in the meantime, for example, what we should be able to do is make sure that everybody, for example, has access to housing. For example, we got to learn how to allow people to accumulate wealth. How do they accumulate wealth? They accumulate wealth, the vast majority of people, through investments in their home, they build equity in their homes. If, for example, the homes of African Americans were valued at the same number that a white home, the same exact home was valued at, because of the prejudice that exists, it’s not, it would be $154 billion more wealth among African American communities just by the valuation of homes. So there’s a whole range of those things. But what I’m trying to figure out is how we keep people from drowning at the moment, at this moment. And for example, if we’re going to go back to work, how do we go… For example, there are no standards how we send kids back to school or daycare. None at all. None. What are we going to do? We got to lay that out now, because how many… For example, I think every single solitary person out there who has a child should have childcare. I think every single paid for by the Federal Government if they don’t have the income. We were just discussing that with a friend of mine, is that, even my job, they are calling people back, but they are calling them on a Friday and say, “Report to work Monday. They’re the things I think that we have to put in place now to get us to survive through this, to get people so they all aren’t drowning, so we don’t end up in such despair and loss. But most of all, what we’re going to have spent probably by January, close to three trillion dollars to try to save people from total bankruptcy or save people from absolutely having nothing to be able to provide for themselves or their families. And how do we get that done? How do we get that done? Because we have to then… Then we’re going to come in with real genuine, what we call rebuilding, the changing for the 21st century. For example, schooling. I’m sure people come in to you right now. We’re finding out that, what we knew, I’ve been trying to get a $200 billion passed to be able to provide for high speed internet for the entire country. Well guess what? A lot of people don’t have it. A significant number, particularly in rural areas, even more than in urban areas. Not working good. Not at all. No. What are we going to do about that? Because what’s happening is we are going to find people further and further and further behind. And so, from my standpoint, the way I look at this is kind of in two phases. How do we keep people from falling off the cliff completely, keep them on dry land up there, number one, and have them be able to move forward? And then, how do we move them into a completely different circumstance than they were before? We have a chance to make significant institutional changes to exist out there. Like I said, we’re one of the only civilized countries, industrialized countries in the world. I misspoke. Industrialized countries in the world that does not have childcare, that does not have paid leave, that does not have all these things that affect their daily, daily lives. And so, there’s a lot of institutional changes that we can and will make, and we lay them out. For example, the proposal I put forward. I’m not going to bore you with it because it doesn’t affect your day-to-day operation right now. But the proposal I put forward, every expert who looked at it, is going to create at least 10 million new jobs, 10 million new and high paying jobs. Not six bucks an hour, eight bucks an hour, not even 15 bucks an hour, but 48 or 50 bucks an hour. For example, we’re going to install in the first year that I’m president over 550,000 charging stations on every new highway. We’re going to own the electric vehicle market. Why should that not be us? But that’s not going to affect your eyeglass business today, this moment. And so there’s a whole range of things that… So what I’m trying to find out today is how do we build? For example, everybody’s been saying, all the experts have been saying from the beginning that you have to test and trace. You see what’s happened when you don’t trace, you see how the coronavirus is escalating in the states now. Okay? Not all states, but at least 12 of them, escalating. And probably, going into the winner, it’s going to probably get worse. So, what are we doing? Well, there a lot of people that are unemployed now, particularly young people. What I’m proposing that we do is we have a nationwide data-driven disease surveillance system. We need to hire 100,000 people now, now, as tracers from communities. Pay them a decent wage to be the ones who go out and trace when they find a new COVID case. That’s their thing. Only thing we know what’s going to [inaudible 00:41:55] maybe for vaccine that’s going to make a difference. It’s going to keep things down. But we can do that. But permanently, I think we need an entire new Public Health Corps out there. We need to be able to provide for significantly greater care across the board in terms of public health and that can create millions of jobs across the country. My point is that what do you do right now to ensure that there’s worker protection, there’s accountability, and as we reopen, we reopen responsibly and put you in a position where you’re safe when you show up to work, and it’s guaranteed you’re going to be safe, where you’re tested, tracing going on, and the circumstances, the protective gear, and the protective circumstances that you work in exist. And how are you going to be in a position now to be able to reopen and be able to do what needs be done to provide for what you do in terms of giving people… For example, we’re finding out that a lot of optometrists are in trouble right now because people don’t want to go in and put their eye up against that glass and have someone else look in that close to them. And they’re worried. There are things that can be done to increase the many significantly, the likelihood that you are going to be spreading the disease. No, definitely not. No. That’s my point. So, this is why I wanted to talk just bread and butter about immediate things that can be done. … debt overhang. Even if none of her employees had children back at home or were worried about spreading anything, people aren’t going to come in. So what enables them? Not anybody, but they’re not going to come in. What you can do and you’re right about near term. You can begin to be able to get help in terms of how you have a business where you can go online and say, “Send me your prescription. I can have it filled. This is how we’ll do it. And tell me the doctor gave you the prescription and we will fill the prescription. We will in fact be able to do that.” Or “I need a new prescription. My doctor tells me, and this is …” So you can do a lot of telemedicine that way. But the first thing we have to do is like, for example the idea you get called back on a Friday, there’s no one available on a Saturday, Sunday or Monday or a Tuesday or a Wednesday or Thursday or Friday the next week take care of the child. How do you get that done? Well, that’s why I lay out here and I propose a significant childcare capacity that we have to build, that we should build now and the government should be paying for as long as this crisis exists. And think of all the people that don’t ask for testing. They’re afraid to get tests, even if it’s available to them because of the cost. They think it’s going to cost them something. And if they get sick and they have to acknowledge their sick and quarantined for the days that they’re sick or while they’re sick, or cost of hospitalization. Right now, the President United States is trying to do away with the only healthcare policies out there. And you have millions of businesses, major businesses have gone out of business, where you, in fact, you lose your ability. They’ve gone out of business, big ones, where they provide health insurance, they’ve gone out of business and what do you have? You’ve been paying in half for that program? Well, I think under the existing law now we have, I think the federal government should pay the other half as long as this exists so you can maintain your privately held insurance. But the generic point I’m trying to make here is and there’s so much out there is one, how do we enable you with surety to be able to go back to work and feel safe yourself? Number one. Be able to ensure that your employees are physically safe and thirdly, have a sign on the door of the customer say, “I can go into that business and I know I’m going to be protected” because they’ve done everything that has been said that needs to be done in order to enhance the prospect that I will not, whatever I get in that store, whatever I get in that facility, I am going to get in a way that is not totally dissimilar, that like it was before the COVID hit. We need to be able to guarantee that we federally fund paid leave for workers that are caring for their families. We need to ensure that all workers that get sick from COVID for as long as they need that their costs are going to be paid for by the federal government. We need all the things that needs to be done to make sure that you are safe and your employees are safe and your customers are safe, is in the meantime, paid for by the federal government. You shouldn’t have to borrow that money. This is a crisis. This is a national, international health crisis. And so if we don’t do that, it’s going to cost the government a lot more down the road because we can’t keep these businesses open. I got an idea. Sure. One of the largest industry clusters for minority businesses is in janitorial. And so as we think about getting people back to work, many buildings like this are accustomed to regular cleaning. But now you have to do a higher level, which is called sanitizing. And so here in Pennsylvania, a group of minority and business and civic leaders have come together and formed a PA COVID task force. And we’ve been looking at janitorial firms and thinking about how we help them get their certifications and licensing for this higher level of cleaning. And so vice president, it’s a way we could get people to work right now because every restaurant, every business could put an [inaudible 00:48:40] this building was cleaned and sanitized. And that should be paid for by the federal government. I agree with that. Well, that’s part of my proposal. Okay. All right. That’s part of my proposal. The whole idea is how do you change the circumstance? Where when the press and all of us leave here, we would feel confident to walk into a building. Look, we talk about essential workers. How we give them such credit, we clap for them. We bang pans together. We do the rest. Well, I don’t want to clap for them. I want to pay them. Pay them a living wage to do what they do, because a lot of them are losing their lives. You’re going in and you’re sanitizing that operating room afterwards, it exposes you. The fact that you don’t have all the protective equipment, these janitorial services don’t have, they should be able to get that because they’re doing a public service. In addition to being able to get paid. And again, they just go, “Well, there goes up big spending Democrat again. Spend all that money.” If we don’t do this, we’re going to be in deep, deep and deeper trouble economically. Why are we, when we learned about the coronavirus, the same time that countries like Germany and South Korea and others found out? Why are we in terms of on a percentage basis? Why is our unemployment so much higher? Why is our death rate so much higher? Why do we have so many cases that have been diagnosed so far? Compared as a percent of population significantly higher. Obviously, we have a larger population, but it’s significantly higher percent of people in the United States who’ve contracted COVID. Significantly higher percentage based on the population have died. Why? Because the federal government, this administration not federal, this administration did nothing. They did nothing. The Columbia study at Columbia University points out that if the president acted just two weeks earlier, 54,000 more people would be alive today. Alive today, today. And so that’s why we can’t waste any more time. Imagine the impact on the economy. Just think of it in terms of numbers. If those 54,000 people were still alive. I think we have to create this public health jobs corps. Mr. Vice President, I think it was the Wall Street Journal said that “80% of Americans think that the country is out of control.” So when you say about the soul of America and you’re in the district and West Philadelphia, where I said these are fantastic people, they are very passionate and they feel like somewhat who’s talking to them? So can you talk a little bit connected because at least me, I think when you talk about the soul of America, talk a little bit about that in context of what you’re saying. Well, look, I know West Philly a little bit, not a lot. The only reason I know a little bit is I have all granddaughters and grandkids that went to school here and lived up in 59th Street. Anyway, I don’t know it well, I don’t mean to imply I don’t. Okay. But I do know the east side of Wilmington, Delaware really, really well. I do know my state has the 8th largest African American population in United States of America. Okay. My city’s well over 50% African American, that’s what I come out of. I know it. Here’s the point about the soul of America. This president from the very beginning, from the moment he came down that escalator and his golden building, what did he start off saying? “I’m going to see to it, that we get rid of all those Mexican rapists.” That’s the first thing he talked about. Secondly, what did he do? He decided that he was going to pit us against one another based on race. When you saw those people in Charlottesville coming out of the fields, carrying those torches, their veins, they’re bulgy and screeching that anti-Semitic hate and bile using the same phrases used in Germany, in the 30s, in the early 30s in Nazi Germany accompanied by the KU Klux Klan. The Grand Wizard said, “This is why we elected him.” Okay. Of the KU Klux Klan. And then a young woman gets killed and he gets asked, he gets asked to comment. And he said, “There were very fine people on both sides.” No president of the history of the United States of America has ever said anything remotely like that. And so what I learned coming out of the movement, much, much earlier as a kid is you think you can defeat hate. You can only make it hide. And when you give it oxygen, when a president speaks, no matter how good or bad he is, people listen. And when he speaks and gives credibility to these racist, I’ll watch my language, folks out there, he breathes oxygen, they come out from under the rocks and you’re seeing it. You’re seeing it all across the country. As a consequence of that, what happens? We then tile on top of that a triple whammy. Then we end up with COVID and remember, I’m the guy that asked for the CDC to keep detailed reports on exactly who contracts it. Exactly who based on ethnicity, race, national origin, et cetera. And how many die? Because a friend of mine, the Mayor of Detroit told me what was really happening in Detroit, which I was responsible for in our administration where people who in fact are people of color. Well, guess what? Why is that happening? Because lack of access. And so, this is something that I think and then on top of it, the Floyd family. George gets brutally murdered for the whole world to see it. You’ve never seen and I come out, I was a kid when Dr. King … I came back from law school when Dr. King was assassinated. And when I came back, my city is the only city in America occupied by the National Guard since Reconstruction, because a significant portion was burned to the ground. I came back, I had a job with a good law firm and I quit and became a public defender. But even Dr. King’s assassination did not have the worldwide impact that George Floyd’s death did. Because just like television changed the Civil Rights Movement for the better when they saw Bull Connor and his dogs ripping the clothes off of elderly black women going to church and fire hoses ripping the skin off of young kids. All those folks around the country who didn’t have any black populations heard about this, but didn’t believe it but they saw it. It was impossible to close their eyes. Well, with George Floyd, what happened to George Floyd, now you got how many people around the country? Millions of cellphones. It’s changed the way everybody’s looking at this. Look at the millions of people marching around the world, the world. So my point is that I think people are really realizing that this is a battle for the soul of America. Who are we? What do we want to be? How do we see ourselves? What do we think we should be? Character is on the ballot here. That’s what this is about. And so, that’s why I’m convinced that with rational proposals that costs a lot of money. The American public is ready to step up. They understand the need to make these systemic changes, dealing from racism to structures that our economy has just stacked the deck against anybody who doesn’t have any money. By the way, the unemployment rate among Latinos is higher than among blacks. They’re both ridiculously high, but what do we talk about? Well, we got to take the blinders need to be taken off the American people. And they’re looking at it and they’re saying, “We got to do something. This is not who we are. It’s not the world I want my kid growing up.” Even if they are upper middle class folks, this is not the world I want my kids growing up in. So we have a chance, but I think it’s important to lay out ahead of time what are the things that will most affect your collective ability to be around, have jobs and have the capacity to grow when we get this under control? And that takes you to the thought about wealth. That’s why every single first-time home buyer I provide for a $15,000 down payment period, period. That’s why I make sure that we double the amount of money that goes from the federal government to small business operations in every state, from a trillion and a half bucks to two and a half to three trillion. I mean, it should be three billion taking off the sidelines about $60 billion. That’s what it will do. That’s all about people that are able to get the kind of loans and/or guarantees that they need to be able to move. We have to start educating people that the evidence is that black entrepreneurs are equally successful as any other group of entrepreneurs. Their success rate is as high or as good. But we’ve got to provide the mechanisms. And I guess, as I said, maybe this is just too wonky as we say. Too much detail about how to get there, but we have to do, in my view, we have to create a testing and personal protective gear right off the bat for businesses that they don’t have to pay for so they can in fact, move forward. Secondly, we got to go out there and we got to make sure we’re in a situation where we guaranteed paid leave for anybody who cannot show up because they have somebody suffering from the disease and/or they have to be quarantined. Thirdly, it seems me, we have to go out there and make sure that we’re in a position where we ensure workers have the protection and there’s accountability from those companies, those bigger companies that don’t provide that protection. And that’s where you get in the whole idea of what are the standards that are going to be set up by OSHA and how are we going to make sure they’ve kept? I think we have to build a national contact tracing workforce that has the benefit of putting a 100,000 people to work now to get paid in excess of $15 an hour just to do the tracking by the federal government. That’s the thing that is going to pull things under control. And I think we also have to protect older Americans or those with disabilities and require big employers to tailor work requirements to their needs. And we have to create this, I think this safer shopper program, because no matter how good you do, unless people are confident they can walk in and be okay, they’re not going to walk in your door. And then we have to restart small businesses. We’ve got to do it in a big way. And that deals with everything from allowing you to be able to get grants for fixed costs.In addition to keeping people employed. We have to make sure we grant businesses the cost of restarting in this challenging environment. And we have to reopen our schools and our childcare programs, but there’s no guidance. There’s no guidance out there for how you do that. No guidance. And I think this is a reflection. If we don’t do this, Dwight it does reflect a lack of us all. Because so many people, so many people are in trouble right now. And we’re getting virtually no guidance from the White House. Just going to open up. He’s going down to Texas on Juneteenth, right? The first major massacre, literally speaking of the Black Wall Street, right? Years ago. He’s going to have a rally, going to have a rally. And he doesn’t wear a mask. I mean, come on. In the meantime, this is not your problem, but it’s going to be your consequence. He’s also doing an enormous damage to us internationally. You walk away from any cooperation with the World Health Organization, we walk away from any cooperation on vaccines. What worries me the most, I see nothing that is being done to prepare for what the experts and scientists are telling us is likely to be a bounce back. You already have a CDC say, “They do not have enough protective gear, stockpile now for what’s happening.” You got 12 States. I’m praying that this is an aberration, but I don’t think so. I meet with almost four days a week, I have an hour to an hour and a half briefing with Vivek Murphy and the former head of the FDA and the health staff. They’re worried, but they’re worried about it’s coming back. And again, what we said from the beginning and I’ll stop. You got to have testing and tracing. You got to have all the protective gear necessary and you’ve got to have it stockpiled now, just as a bare minimum to start. But I also think that what we should be doing is giving you and other businesses, the ability to say, “This is a circumstance in which you can reopen safely. These are the things that have to be done in order to do that.” We will pay you to help you do that because it’s in the national interest to do that. You will be able not only to be able to have money to keep people employed, but to provide for overhead and infrastructure that you need in order to be able to get. Because I think what you said, Tiffany is you’ve been completely honest with me. Even if tomorrow, you had no restrictions on, you open up completely. And you’re right, Ms. Clark. We’ve got to prepare the way, begin to prepare the way for the 21st century here. We’re well into it. We got to prepare the way of we’re going to come back to the future. How we’re going to come back and make sure that we are able to deal with what is not just the pandemic, God willing we’ll have a vaccine. But what happens is how can we better impact on your bottom line and the number of people you have employed by, for example, having the equivalent of telemedicine for you being able to be online. You having the ability and you getting the technical expertise available to tell you how you get and how you do that. And that should be a federal government responsibility as well. Because again, it’s all about having business to be able to be open and employ people to generate economic growth. … with growth. And I haven’t even gotten into the things which are even larger. Access to housing, access to healthcare, access to so many other things that are just basic human necessities. But I’ve talked too much. You actually touched a lot of things that was going through my mind as far as how we go back to work in a safe environment. It’s not going to. We cannot let… As long as this crisis exists, we have to make sure that unemployment is paid. And the unemployment that these guys put together is the most generous unemployment program in American history. $600 on top of whatever your expected unemployment would be. But look at the states that have been so slow in getting it out. States like Florida and others that have been terrible. Your state’s been better because it’s required. They even put money in, half billion dollars in there to make sure that you can pull people from other parts of government and quickly train them on how to deal with an unemployment claim. Because the number of claims is overwhelming, more than any time in American history. But you’re going to be able to get unemployment. We’re going to be able to have unemployment for anyone as long as this crisis continues. And for businesses that are larger than yours but smaller than the big businesses, but even those, we should have basically employment insurance. If you had 20 employees, you only needed 10, you keep all 20 on the payroll. They all work half time and the federal government makes up the rest. So they get their full salary. You have all the workforce you need. And people aren’t left out and sitting home and then end up in a circumstance where they’re collecting unemployment. And you know as well as I do, you know extremely well, that if you have someone who has the same exact background and record as the other person. One person has been unemployed three weeks, another person been unemployed six months, and they both apply for the job, what happens? The person who’s been unemployed six months, they just take off the table. Don’t even look at them. Implication is they must be not as good as the other or they would have been hired already. So there’s a real concern about providing people with some dignity. Just some dignity. My dad used to have an expression. He said, “Joey, a job’s about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in the community. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, ‘Honey, it’s going to be okay. It’s going to be okay,’ and mean it. We moved from Pennsylvania. When coal died, I was in grade school. My dad didn’t have a job. I remember him walking up the stairs and saying, “Honey, you’re going to have to go live with grandpa. It’ll be about a year.” The longest walk any parent makes, and a lot of black and white and Hispanic parents have made that walk. He said, “I’ll come home every weekend,” only 157 miles down to Claymont, Delaware. And I thought, God, that’s like going to the moon. I was in grade school. Well, I then moved down to Claymont, Delaware. You know Claymont. Okay. Well, Claymont was a real working class town, a steel mill town. Get up in the morning when there was frost in the window and drive you to school, turn on the windshield wiper, and there’d be an oil slick, not joking, an oil slick on because of there’s more refineries and markets up in that area than anywhere else. Pennsylvania didn’t do much about it because the prevailing wind is south and east. So, I think people are going through the devil, but at least my dad, he thought that he meant it. We’re going to be okay. He thought there was kind of an even shot out there. And if you work like hell, it took two years to be able to get enough money, to three years to be able to put a down payment on a house. We had four kids, three bedrooms and a grandpop in a split level home. We didn’t think anything was wrong with that. It was a safe neighborhood. But my point is he had a shot. Look at all the people that don’t get a shot now, even to get there. This is not only about dealing with, in my view, it’s not only about restoring the dignity and soul of this country, it’s about this time when we have a chance to rebuild a middle class, bring everybody along. Everybody. Black, Hispanic, disabled. Bring everybody along. And we can do this because the public is now seeing what happens when you’re left out. You’re left aside. More of your folks have died, providing services. The grocery store workers stacking the shelves have died. All of a sudden people are realizing that people can shelter in place like you all have been able to do and me. Who’s been carrying this on their back? Essential workers. Anyway. I think we want to take a picture of us like this. Does anybody want to say anything? Because what I need is your phone numbers too. I want to be able to call you, too. For real. One of my big concerns, Vice President is time. If you look at three months and we’ve had approximately 41% of minority businesses shutter their doors in another three months, because we’re living with uncertainty about opening up doors and whether it be PPE equipment or whatever we need, the clock is ticking, right? And every month I go by that these small businesses are not able to generate revenue, not able to bring back or keep employees. Just putting us further and further behind. And so my concern is what are we going to do right now from a timestamp point? And how do we get, Tiffany as an example, I recognize she’s in eyewear but maybe it’s an investment to her to start this sanitizing business as an example. And so I going around to other eyeglass places and sanitizing their business, we have to be able to help businesses pivot right now. Well, I think what you have to do is right now, there are a number of programs available where you can be closed and still in fact, make money. Where the federal government makes sure your employees and you are taken care of, as providing for the programs that have already been passed that have not been made available to small businesses. The money is there. It’s sitting there now. I like it now, yeah. I guarantee you, it is. I guarantee you it is. $2 trillion, but you have now a significant portion of is going to the wrong people, because either you don’t have the capacity to know how to apply for it, or you have the capacity. For example, one of the things that happened when we started and I’ll end with this. One of the things when we started, when this program first passed, the first CARES Act. What I would propose the President do is I would have him use the Defense Production Act, which is a thing that allows him to designate an operation. You’re going to shift from making pajamas, to making gowns for people in operating rooms. I said, we should have someone oversee the large banks. And where they’re going to lend because they never lend to small businesses. So you go to a big bank and I’m not going to mention any of them right now, but I can. And their loan is guaranteed, they’re guaranteed. We bailed them out. They’re guaranteed. Okay. And so they’re supposed to be the conduit. What do they say to you? Do you have an account here? Do you have account? Do you have a credit card with us? How long you been doing business with us, et cetera? Well, what the hell? And I knew they don’t like lending to small businesses. It’s too tedious for them. It takes too much time. So they’d much rather have somebody come in, a major real estate developer or of a Trump friend who come in and lend them $58 million giving them $58 million out of the program is easy to do. It’s easy to do. And that’s when Dwight and others went back and said, we’re going to get community banks then involved. If you work in a community in West Philly, then you got to be able to lend in West Philly. Well, that’s helped some, but the idea the money’s not getting there and it was designed to get there. How many Dwight, I can’t remember how maybe my staff remembers, but how much money is in the downtown small business fund? I forget the exact name of it. I think it’s, I forget how many billion dollars it is as of last week not a penny of it was loaned yet. Not a penny of it was put out there. There’s a lot of money there now. And what we did, what we’re pushing to do is make sure that it’s not only covers the employees you keep employed. If you’re trying to keep someone on the payroll, you get paid to keep them on the payroll, number one. And number two, your overhead gets paid. Your overhead gets paid, whether or not you have a customer coming in. That was the intent of the program. So that while we built back, the ability to show up and open up, then in fact, you still had employees who were getting paid. And you were able to make it so you didn’t lose your business. How many people are losing their business, because they’re basically going bankrupt? They’re going bankrupt. Think of all the people right now in West Philly who have a home who can’t pay their mortgage now. Well, they should be guaranteed while this is going on their mortgage gets paid. How about rent? Look at all the people now. Sitting there and saying, “Okay, so I get a loan. But what happens when, in fact, six months from now, now I have a rent bill that I have, that is a, I don’t know, 6,000 bucks or larger? Where do I get the money for that?” And so that’s what these programs were designed to do to help. And if you notice you don’t have any, it’s going to sound self serving. But when I was asked to take care of the Recovery Act in the Obama Biden administration, it was over $80 billion. We got out in less than 18 months. I was on the phone every single day. I spoke with over 156 mayors, every governor, but one, the woman from Alaska who could see Russia from her front porch. I tried, but she was not interested. All kidding aside. And they’d say, “We need this much money.” I said, “Okay.” And this is what we’re going to do to increase employment. One guy said, “We’re going to build a polar bear park.” I said, “No.” He said, “Under the law, I can do that.” I said, “Yeah, you can, but it’s going to make the program look silly. Here’s the deal. If you build it, I’m going to come out and hold a press conference and say you’re wasting money.” “You wouldn’t do that.” “Try me, try me.” It takes moment to moment to moment care. But guess what? The money got to where it had to go kept all those teachers employed because the states couldn’t pay for them. Kept all those firefighters on the job because they couldn’t be paid for. Those first responders on the job as you couldn’t be paid for. That’s where it came from. Look, what’s happening now. Dwight’s been trying to get money for state and local assistance. Because they all have balanced budgets. Correct. And what’s happened. They’re all going into gigantic debt. They can’t borrow the money. It’s not happening. So there are answers. There are answers and their answers that are available right now. But you know, this idea of somehow separating the COVID crisis from the jobless crisis is a fool’s errand. They’re tied together. Unless you deal with the COVID crisis, you’re not going to be able to openly deal with the job crisis and they’re simultaneous. But like I said, even now I’ll give you a few little points. Texas has reported the highest number of hospitalizations since the pandemic. Meanwhile, the white house taskforce on the pandemic has not even met since May the 28th. Okay, hadn’t even met. And the testing czar, the guy’s supposed to be the czar to set up testing is resigning. What is this? What in God’s name are we talking about? So, we got to be able the old saying goes, walk and chew gum at the same time here. Because there’s no reason why a woman who’s as capable as you running a business should be in a position as a consequence of the failure of the President of the administration, to be able to deal with this crisis, essentially going out of business and have nothing over your head. No reason, none. This money wasn’t supposed to go to the fortune 500 companies. I’m not making, they don’t need it, but look at what’s happening. So anyway, what I’m going to do is I’m going to send you a memo that lays out the specific things that I think we could do to promote small businesses, particularly minority owned businesses. And make sure how we do it. So you know what I’m talking about and what we do in the real recovery. When we have to re-invest money to create significantly new jobs. I’ll send to you what we’re doing relative to all the issues relating to health and safety of SEIU workers. I mean, you represent everyone from nurses all the way down to sanitation workers and what we do. And I’ll send you Tiffany, a layout of what I think. And I will get one of my experts on the phone with you to see how we can actually personally try to figure out how we can guide you to get to the programs that are available to you. And just send me the I want to win. Well, you know, if I win, it’s in no small part because you came out earlier and said I should win. Well, look, I don’t have to state the obvious all the answers. But the one thing I promise you I’ll do, I’ll take responsibility. No President that I’ve ever witnessed as a student of history was smart enough to handle all the problems. When I make a mistake, I’ll say it, I’ll acknowledge it and fix it. And I think we just have to just take more responsibility in government. And the idea, like I said, the words of a President matter. No matter who the President is. The words of a President, no matter how competent or incompetent they are, can send a nation to war, they can bring peace. They can make the stock market rise or fall. Look what’s happening now. Only thing he’s been concerned about is the stock market. And there is very little correlation between the health of the stock market and the quality of life for the vast majority of the middle class and working class and poor folks. It’s just almost totally disconnected. Doesn’t mean it’s not a good thing to have the stock market boom, but it does mean it’s not a good thing when there’s no way in which that wealth is able to be shared. And imagine if we had that $2 trillion tax cut that he promoted and got passed for the wealthy, even places like the Heritage Foundation said that didn’t grow the economy. $2 trillion. Imagine if we had it right now, to focus on the things that can build a new economy, invest in everything from teleconference, into providing for the kind of health. Vice President, I would love for you to wave your hand at Jeff [Wicklam 01:23:43] back there. He’s got that blue shirt, Jeff, stand up. Jeff has been with the Enterprise Center over 20 years and he manages our real estate and facility and he helped to make this event successful today. And I just want you to recognize him. Well, Jeff, thank you very much, pal. I really mean it. Thank you. Thank you. So we’re going to take a group photo, if you just look at Adam in he blue blazer with his hand raised. Think about questions you haven’t asked me, you want to ask. I’ll make sure you have phone numbers you can get we so we can follow up on the things I said. Yes. I’m smiling, I forgot I had a mask. I do that all the time. Well, I’ll tell you what with all the heat I got for wearing a mask. Trump not wearing a mask. Tell you what, science matters. Yes. Dwight, thank you, pal. Any time. Any time, Vice President. I got my card. And make sure staff took all those notes. And I’ll follow up on it. I got my card, Vice President. All right, there you go. Thank you. I think we have Tiffany’s number I think I’m not certain. Yes, we have all of their numbers, and I took notes to follow up. Okay. Dwight, thanks, pal. Any time, Vice President. Thanks for the passport into your district. I appreciate it. You were here a week ago at City Hall. That’s in there. So if you want to get a place, let us know. Well, I tell you what, all I know is that my son who passed away, went to Penn and he had to borrow the money. We had to borrow to get there. And he’s never missed a payment. And so I’m still hanging out paying the last thing of that loan. That was the best thing to happen for him. Philly’s a great city. Thank you for having us. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, all. Appreciate it. Every time I walked out of my grandpa’s house in Scranton, he’d yell, “Keep the faith.” We can do this, guys. We can change this country for the better. I agree. The nest thing about America is every significant crisis we’d had, we’re the only country to turn it around. We can do this. [crosstalk 01:26:24]. Thank you. [inaudible 01:26:39] Tiffany, passion, fired up. I felt like I was just sitting here. You didn’t use it. Get into it. I was trying."
"79","06-17-20"," We thank the local officials for joining today. I know they’ve got a lot to do and they’ve really been very, very busy. Before I begin my remarks, I want to acknowledge that it was five years ago today when a white supremacist walked into Mother Emanuel Church in Charleston, South Carolina and slaughtered a friend of mine, Clementa Pinckney, and eight other parishioners. It was hate unbridled, and it was poisonous, a poisonous expression of white supremacy that still infects our nation and many of our institutions and of the dangers we face as a society if we don’t root out this corrosive and deadly ideology. When I reflect back on the amazing grace and compassion and forgiveness of the Mother Emanuel community, I see the very best in what we see in America as Americans, but we know that grace alone is not enough. We have to put it to work, that grace, and we’re seeing the best of America in that as well. In the weeks of peaceful protest, civil action is taking place in cities and towns of every size, in this state and every other state across the country. People are keeping their eyes focused on how danger it is, how much danger it is to live a life of a black or a brown-skinned person in this country, and Americans are out there marching, notwithstanding the fact that we’re in the middle of a pandemic. That’s how critical they think it is. On Monday, Donald Trump said, “If we stopped testing right now for COVID-19, we’d have very few cases if any.” If we stopped testing, we’d have very few cases if any. It’s a statement that’s not only absurd, it’s absolutely tragic. Yesterday, the head of the White House task force on coronavirus, the vice president, claimed success in the fight because deaths are “down to fewer than 750 a day.” 750 fathers and mothers, sisters and brothers, uncles, aunts, husbands, wives, children dying every day. More than 20,000 a month. That’s greater than World War II level casualties each month, that’s more than five 9/11s each month, and this administration is engaging in self-congratulations? Maybe good enough for Donald Trump, but it will never, ever be acceptable if I’m your president. Researchers have shown that tens of thousands of Americans have died needlessly because Donald Trump was slow to respond to the crisis and then when he did he bungled the response. For weeks in January and February, I but I wasn’t alone, I was raising my concerns about how we need to take this virus seriously, all while Trump was ignoring the reporting from his own intelligence community in his daily briefings, and the warnings of his closest advisors, all the while praising the Chinese government for being transparent in handling this virus instead of demanding access for the CDC that Beijing was refusing to give in Wuhan. The American people have sacrificed so much to fight this virus. We’ve lost lives, we’ve lost businesses, we’ve lost paychecks, and now thanks to Donald Trump’s bungling, we may lose some of the progress we begun to make. All because he’s lost interest. He’s once again ignoring the facts. The public health response is still woefully, woefully lacking from this administration. More than 117,000 people have died in the United States of America, with an average daily number of cases still climbing in 21 states. We still don’t have what we need when it comes to rapid results testing, contact tracing capacity, widely available personnel protective equipment for them, or clear nationwide guidance. Instead, President Trump pushes dangerous disproven drugs, stands in the way of the CDC issuing guidelines on reopening. They had them, wanted to issue them and he wouldn’t let them. He refuses to wear a mask, failing even the most basic test of leadership. He scaled back meetings of the COVID-19 task force. I guess there’s not much to do in spite of experts saying that testing and tracing is necessary for reopening, he sent his testing czar home. The money provided to the Pentagon for essential medical supplies, only 15%, only 15% has made it out the door. Donald Trump wants to style himself as a wartime president against this invisible enemy, the coronavirus. Unlike any other war, any other wartime leader, he takes no responsibility, he exercises no leadership, and now he’s just flat surrendering the fight. Instead of leading the charge to defeat the virus, he just basically waved a white flag and has retreated [inaudible 00:06:45] to get back on his campaign, to his campaign rallies that he’ll put people at risk as everyone’s pointed out, in violation of the CDC Guidelines that still warn against large gatherings as long as he’s going to allow this to happen, but he’s ready to do it as long as, notwithstanding CDC guidance, as long as the people showing up sign a waiver promising they’ll not hold the campaign liable. Donald Trump’s failure to fight the coronavirus with the same energy and focus that he uses to troll his enemies on Twitter has cost us lives and is putting hope for an economic recovery at risk. Job numbers and retail sales were better than expected in May, and that’s great news for the country, but now Donald Trump’s desire to declare victory and be done with it is only going to imperil the continued progress we have to make. Our economy is still sputtering, with more than 20 million people unemployed and no clear guidance from the federal government for what businesses need to do to reopen safely, efficiently, and generate a strong recovery. This isn’t a debate about whether to reopen. It’s about how we make reopening work for everyone. The employees at the White House, they get daily COVID-19 tests. They know they’re safe before they go to work and they know their co-workers are safe. They have the confidence to resume their lives. Workers across the country aren’t asking for daily testing. They’re just asking for regular, reliable access to tests. So it’s not that Donald Trump doesn’t recognize the importance of testing, it’s that he’s not up to the task or doesn’t care and now he’s seemingly decided he doesn’t even want to try, but just like he couldn’t wish COVID-19 away in March, just like he couldn’t tweet it away in April, he can’t ignore it away in June. So I have some basic questions for President Donald Trump. What are you going to do to make sure every worker has access to regular testing so they have the same confidence to go into a store or go back to work that White House staffers have? Why are you leaving schools and child care centers to navigate the uncertainty all on their own without an effective guidance and resources that they need to protect the kids and their communities? Why don’t you enforce the OSHA standards for worker protection during this global pandemic? Why is it the Main Street Lending Program created more than two months ago by the Congress to help struggling small businesses only opened for registration to lenders two days ago, and still hasn’t distributed a single penny. Why don’t you disclose the names, Mr. How many cronies got bailouts? How many donors? How many big businesses that didn’t need it? What business had to shut down because they were denied funding in April? What businesses didn’t get special approval that others got by a nod from the top? Why did you get rid of the watchdog, Mr. President? Why did you get rid of the watchdog, appointed to oversee every dollar distributed, an inspector general? Why did you get rid of that person the Congress passed? What are you trying to hide? It’s bad management on top of bad planning on top of neglect and it’s totally unacceptable for a great nation like ours. Folks, here’s the truth. The pandemic is still here. It’s going to be here for the foreseeable future until we get it under control or until we have safe and proven widely available vaccine. COVID-19 is a fact of nature. We have to deal with this virus and everything that comes with it. We have to deal with it head on, honestly, tell the people the truth. To paraphrase Franklin Roosevelt in the Depression, the American people can handle anything, just tell them the truth. We can’t deal with it the way you’re doing it. The only way to deal with it, Mr. President, if we put in the work, investing and building a dynamic, resilient economy and health system capable of getting and then staying ahead of new outbreaks. We have the capacity and the resources to do that. I have laid out baseline steps of what needs to be done from make it work checklists for a successful accountable recovery that I put out back in early April to the steps for a strong reopening that I released last week. It’s not rocket science. Granted I have incredible scientists advising me on almost a daily basis on how to proceed, but it’s not rocket science, it’s common sense. It’s straightforward, and that’s why this is perhaps the greatest indictment of Donald Trump’s complete, compelling lack of leadership. He wasted months and months and months passing the buck, blaming everyone else, refusing to act when he should have been preparing our country for a longterm response and building our resiliency to respond to future flareups. Yet we still don’t have a comprehensive system for collecting COVID-19 case data. These are the basics. He should have been preparing us to weather the valleys and peaks of this virus. He should have been working to shore up the vulnerabilities in our healthcare system that have been laid bare in this crisis that he’s trying to eliminate in court. He should have been working to bridge the inequities and strengthen the cracks in the foundation of our economic system that are exposed for everyone to see. He hasn’t done any of it. Because of the depth of Donald Trump’s failures, this pandemic will continue to be worse for all Americans and much worse for black and brown Americans who are getting hit the hardest. Folks in communities like [inaudible 00:15:06], Donald Trump thinks if he puts his head in the sand, the American people will too, but it doesn’t work that way. Not when hundreds of people are still dying every day and millions are unemployed wondering how in God’s name are they going to keep the lights on and food on the table. Not when workers are weighed down with worries about their safety or what happens if they get sick. There are the steps that we need to be taking now to steer us steadily and strongly in the right direction, see us through this time, to make a more resilient future. They’re all available. First, we have to do everything we can to avoid deadly spikes in the infections as people begin to back out into the world. We’re not that much better prepared today for the run of cases that overfills our intensive care units than we were three months ago. Second, we have to help give people the assurance and precautions that are necessary to restart the economy with confidence. If Americans lose what faith they have left, what little faith they have left in the government’s ability to manage this pandemic, we’ll see much deeper and longer lasting economic impacts than we even, and with even greater repercussions for people’s well-being. Mr. President, don’t leave the American people to face this threat on their own with no guidance, resources, or leadership from the federal government. Don’t let support from the CARES Act expire next month while people are still hurting. Don’t leave our frontline workers exposed without the resources they need and don’t waste any more of our time, Mr. President. The American people need confidence and clear guidance grounded in science that’s going to allow them to resume their daily lives. American businesses need the support of the federal government to continue to backstop them through this phases of reopening and workers need assurances that their health is your first concern. Americans need a president who will put the American people first, not his or her own ego. America needs a president who will do the work. I’m ready on Day One, after more than three years in office, why isn’t Donald Trump ready? Mr. President, wake up. Get to work. There is so much more to be done. Thank you."
"80","06-25-20"," Today, we’re in the middle of the worst global health crisis in living memory and Donald Trump will file in the Supreme Court today an attempt to strip away healthcare coverage from tens of millions of families in the United States. Strip away their peace of mind, away from more than 100 million people with pre-existing conditions. If he succeeds, more than 23 million Americans will lose their coverage overnight, including nearly a million Pennsylvanians. Insurers could once again discriminate or deny services or drop coverage for people living with pre-existing conditions like asthma, diabetes, cancer, and so much more. Perhaps most cruelly of all, if Donald Trump has his way, those who have complications from COVID-19 could become the new pre-existing conditions. Some survivors will experience lasting health impacts like lung scarring and heart damage and if Donald Trump prevails in court, insurers would be allowed once again to strip away coverage, jack up premiums, simply because of the battle they survived in fighting coronavirus. Those survivors, having struggled and won their fight of their lives, would have their peace of mind stolen at that moment they needed it most. They would live their lives caught in a vice between Donald Trump’s twin legacies, his failure to protect the American people from the coronavirus, and his heartless crusade to take healthcare protections away from American families. I’ve called on Donald Trump many times to withdraw his lawsuit. Today I’m renewing that call. Mr. President, drop the lawsuit. Stop trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. Stop taking away people’s healthcare and their peace of mind. Now more than ever, stop trying to steal their peace of mind. I cannot comprehend the cruelty that’s driving him to inflict this pain on the very people he’s supposed to serve. You know, one of the families the Affordable Care Act has delivered peace of mind to have been the [Ritters 00:02:40] who live not far from here in Manheim, Pennsylvania. [Jan 00:02:47] and [Madeline 00:02:47] Ritter were just four years old when their mom [Stacy 00:02:51] heard some of the most devastating words that a parent can ever hear, both of her twins had been diagnosed with leukemia. I promise you, that news is news that literally stops your heart. It wrenches your entire world off its axis and the very last thing on your mind, the very last thing that should be on your mind, is whether you can afford the treatment for your children. When Stacy’s twins got sick, there was no Affordable Care Act so after draining days and endless nights, harrowing stem cell transplants and the fickle waves of hope and fear as they undulate, after enduring more than any parent should have to endure, the Ritters still faced a future where their twins could be denied coverage for the rest of their lives because they had a pre-existing condition. The Affordable Care Act was created to put a stop to that inhumanity, to ensure that people like Stacy, thrust into the worst nightmare of their lives, could focus on the fight that matters, save their children. Stacy’s twins won their fight. They beat cancer, and now they’re 22 years of age. Jan is studying early education in Elizabethtown College. Madeline just graduated from Arcadia University with a degree in international studies. Because of the law, the ACA, the insurance companies could no longer deny them coverage because they’re survivors of cancer, a pre-existing condition. I’m proud. I’m proud of the Affordable Care Act. In addition to helping people with pre-existing conditions, this is the law that delivered vital coverage for 20 million Americans who did not have health insurance. A law that bars insurance companies from capping American benefits and from charging women more for insurance simply because they are a woman. It’s a law that reduced prescription drug costs for nearly 12 million seniors [inaudible 00:05:26] see their costs spike because the Medicare donut hole would have suddenly reopened and their costs would have gone up precipitously. It’s a law that saves lives, but now, but now, in the middle of the worst public health crisis in modern history, at least since the pandemic of 1918, Donald Trump is suing to take the Ritters and millions more Americans back to the way things were. I think it’s cruel, it’s heartless, it’s callous, it’s all because in my view he can’t abide the thought of letting stand one of President Obama’s greatest achievements, the Affordable Care Act. You know, we’ve seen that same callousness in his handling of the coronavirus. Just over three months ago, as most Americans were first coming to grips with this unprecedented scale of danger, this pandemic, President Trump publicly claimed that and I quote, “Anybody, anybody that wants a test, anybody can get it.” It simply was not true and he knew it. Then five days ago, in his campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, he admitted telling people and I quote, “We have to slow the testing down. Slow it down please.” He actually said it. In his hour and 50 minute speech, “Slow the testing down please.” At first his spokespeople tried to say he was joking, but then Trump himself said he wasn’t joking. He called testing “a double-edged sword”. Testing is a double-edged sword, that’s the quote. Let’s be crystal clear about what he means by that. Testing unequivocally saves lives and widespread testing is the key to opening our economy again. That’s one edge of the sword. The other edge is that he thinks that finding out that more Americans are sick will make him look bad. That’s what he’s worried about. He’s worried about looking bad. Well Donald Trump needs to stop caring about how he looks and start caring about what America, what is happening to the rest of America. The number of cases is increasing in 29 states. We’re going to be dealing with this for a long time. Trump can’t wish it away. He can’t bend it to meet his political wishes. There are no miracles coming. We’re not going to have to wait for this miracle because none is coming. We’re going to have to step up as Americans, all of us, and do both the simple things and the hard things to keep our families and our neighbors safe to reopen our economy, to eventually put this pandemic behind us, and sadly, we’re going to have to do it without responsible leadership coming out of the White House. So it’s up to us, all of us. We’re going to have to wear masks. I have mine off because we’re socially distanced and I’m standing in front of a microphone. I wear it everywhere I go, when I step outside of my house and I know as Americans it’s not something we’re used to, but it matters. All the evidence from all over the world tells us it just might be the single most effective thing we can do. We’re going to have to socially distance like we are here today. It’s not easy, and it seems so strange to us. Not as Americans but as human beings. We’re built to talk, to laugh, to hug, to gather with other people. I know I am and I know you are, but for now we have to socially distance. It matters. We’re going to have to find a way to keep our economy running as we bring the number of cases down. The president wants us to believe there is a choice between the economy and public health. Amazingly he still hasn’t grasped the most basic fact of this crisis. To fix the economy, we have to get control over the virus. Say it again, to fix the economy, we have to get control over the virus. He’s like a child who can’t believe this has happened to him. All his whining and self pity. Well this pandemic didn’t happen to him. It happened to all of us, and his job isn’t to whine about it, his job is to do something about it, to lead. If I have the honor of being president, I promise you I will lead. I will do everything I can to take responsibility and ease this burden on you and your families. I’ll put your family first. That will begin the dramatic expansion of health coverage and bold steps to lower healthcare costs. We need a public option, now more than ever, especially when more than 20 million people are unemployed. That public option will allow every American, regardless of their employment status, the choice to get a Medicare like plan. It will force private insurers to keep premiums low, offer better coverage because for the first time, will have to compete for your business against the public insurer that doesn’t have to make a profit. We’re going to lower premiums for people buying coverage on their own, by guaranteeing that no American ever has to spend more than 8.5% of their income on health insurance, and that number would be lower for lower income people. All of the details of this plan will be laid out in the next few weeks. We’re also going to further reduce costs by making it less expensive for Americans to choose plans with lower deductibles and out of pocket expenses, by lowering prescription drug prices, by ending the practice of so-called surprise billings which can leave you with unexpectedly high bills after you leave the hospital. So here’s the bottom line. My plan lowers healthcare costs, gets us universal coverage quickly, when Americans desperately need it now. Families are reeling right now, enduring illness, forced into risky choices, losing their employer’s plans in droves as their employers go out of business or have to suspend business. They need lifelines now, now. That’s what the families here today deserve. That’s what the families all across this nation deserve. They don’t need a president to go into court to deny them the healthcare they now have. They need a president who would go into the White House and will fight like hell to make sure they get the healthcare they need. If Donald Trump refuses to end his senseless crusade against health coverage, I look forward to ending it for him and working quickly with Congress to dramatically ramp up protections to get America universal coverage and lower healthcare costs as soon as humanly possible. This is my promise to you. When I’m president, I will take care of your healthcare coverage and your family the same way I would my own. This is personal to me and to my wife Jill. When I was sworn into the United States Senate next to a hospital bed, my wife and daughter had just been killed in a car crash and lying in that bed were my two young boys, surviving boys and I couldn’t have imagine what it would have been like if we hadn’t had healthcare, healthcare we needed and needed immediately. 40 years later, one of those little boys, my grown son Beau Biden, after having been the attorney general and coming back from Iraq for a year, had contracted a fatal cancer. The question wasn’t whether or not he could survive it, the question was how long he would have to live, how many months. I remember sitting in that hospital, Walter Reed, with my two other children Hunter and Ashley, and Jill, and his wife and his two children, holding his hands and I remember thinking, and I give you my word to this, “What in the hell would I do if the insurance company was allowed to do what they could have done before the Affordable Healthcare Act? Come in and say you’ve run out of time. You’ve run out of your coverage. Suffer the last two, three, four, five painful months dying on your own. Suffer in peace.” I can’t fathom, I cannot fathom a parent having to go through that which is exactly what happened to many families before the Affordable Care Act. So Amy, I understand. When I say I’ll take care of your healthcare coverage the same way I take care of my family, there is nothing I take more seriously. That’s my promise to Stacy and Victoria and Amy and to every American. That’s what the presidency is. The presidency is a duty to care. A duty to care for everyone, not just who voted for you but to care for everyone, for all of us. No trust is more sacred, no responsibility more solemn, no purpose more fundamental than for a president to do absolutely everything that he or she can do to protect American lives. So we want every single American to know, if you’re sick, if you’re struggling, if you’re worried about how you’re going to get through the day, I will not abandon you, I will not leave you to face these challenges alone and we’re going to get through this together. We’re going to build a healthcare system. We’re going to build on it. We’re going to build our economy, our country, back to better than it was before this godawful crisis. That I promise you. Let me end by thanking the families for being so public and willing to come here because there’s so many families like yours all across America. When they heard you today, they said, “That’s me. I get it.” There’s real solidarity. We’re going to get this done. I promise you. God bless you all and may God protect our troops. Thank you."
"81","06-27-20"," Hi, everyone. I’m investigative and consumer correspondent Vicki Wynn for NBC News. I am pleased to be with you this afternoon for this virtual event. That takes a look at the presidential campaign through the lens of our communities. Hi everyone, I’m Amna Nawaz, senior national correspondent and primary substitute anchor for the PBS News Hour. And behalf of Vicky of myself, we are so happy to welcome you to the presidential town hall 2020 hosted by Asian and Pacific Islander American Vote or APIA Vote. Vicky. Yes, Amna. Let me go ahead and take it from here. The presidential town hall is the most important forum in which Asian-Americans, native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders will be able to hear directly from the candidates and their surrogates. They will in turn hear what matters from our perspective. The campaigns will address key topics related to healthcare, discrimination and racism in America, immigration, as well as safeguarding the economy during this pandemic in two separated, moderated, discussions. 2020, as you all know, has been a historically challenging year, often tragic, all around the world. In our country and especially for Asian Americans, native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders. COVID-19 became a global pandemic and then we witnessed the murders of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and so many others. Many Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders are committed to becoming better allies at a time when this is needed more than ever. That’s right, Vicky. Today’s important, unprecedented conversation is the result of many community organizations and leaders making the case that our collective voices need to be heard. The foundation has been set, Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders are all becoming more engaged, both as voters and as elected officials. And we hope today’s program encourages you to find your voice and use that voice in your local communities. So first I want to introduce our speakers. We’re going to hear first from Christine Chen, she’s executive director of our host organization, Asian and Pacific Islander American Vote, or APIA Vote. And then from Steven Gong, who’s executive director of the Center for Asian American Media. They’ve also both served as the co-producers of today’s program. So we are grateful to them both. We’re then honored to have joining us from the AARP Daphne Kwok, chief vice president and multicultural leadership for the Asian American audience and Khelan Bhatia, voter engagement director. But first we’re going to hear from Christine Chen. ( silence) [inaudible 00:11:46] though, is excited to welcome all of you for the next two hours as we provide a platform for presidential candidates and campaigns to address and engage the concerns of the Asian American, native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander communities. Since 2008, API Vote has hosted the presidential town hall for the last every four years. This historic event is only made possible with the participation and organizing efforts of over 250 national and local partners that exemplify the beauty of the diversity of our community. Whether it is by geography, age, gender, and ethnicity, foreign born or American born. Today’s event is only made possible with the support of our sponsors, ARP, Comcast, and Nielsen. And we’ll hear from ARP shortly. We also like to thank the Center for Asian American Media, for their pivotal role as co-producer of this presidential town hall. So to kick off, let’s generate some viewer participation. Now, everyone, please grab your smart phones and texts APIA Vote to 72727 the code is now being displayed on your screen. This short survey will allow us to get a general idea of who was tuning in. Again, the code is APIA Vote to the number 72727. We’ll be sure to share some of the survey results with you later in the program. Now, it’s a sign of our times that Vice President Joe Biden and the Trump campaigns will appear at their first major event together at APIA Votes presidential town hall today. It’s hard to ignore the country’s growing racial group of voters, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are on the rise. We’re gaining in popularity, strength, institutional capacity, political sophistication, and expanded coalition and exciting new leaders led by members of the U.S. Congress and first time candidates across the country. And we cannot forget those running in local elections. They are transforming the political debate and landscape. We’re expanding in the popular and new media, using the internet to challenge political ideas, mobilizing activists, and helping to recruit and support candidates. So with that, confronting crisis isn’t new to Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. The pandemic calamity, deepening recession, and racial outrage in the country are stirring energy, in our communities that’s diverse and growing. Outrage and mobilization of an active APIA base continue to build, creating one of the greatest voter participation engines than ever before. Asian American Pacific Islanders are using social media to organize and fight back against racially motivate attacks during the pandemic. We’re a group with a history of being scapegoated from Japanese Americans detained during World War Two, a Chinese American man by auto workers, angry about Japanese competition in the 1980s. And to the tax against South Asian Americans after the tragedies of 9/11. There’s an urgency to drown out both bigotry and apathy. By coming together for today’s event, this is only a testament that this community is using their relationships to activate their families, friends, neighbors, and communities to register and get out the vote. Thank you for your participation. So let’s get on with the program. Hello, we at the Center for Asian American Media are honored to partner with APIA Vote to present this historic presidential town. These are extraordinary times with the COVID-19 pandemic, rising unemployment, the increase in anti-Asian hate crimes, and now a nationwide movement for racial justice and reform. All of these things make it more critical than ever for the Asian American community to participate in the democratic process. CAAM was founded 40 years ago in a similar time of tremendous cultural and political turmoil. And we’re drawing on decades of experience in public media and our mission to bring Asian American stories to the broadest audience possible. So we’re proud to be here with APIA Vote, both to bring the diverse Asian American community together for these important conversations. And also to ensure that our voices and perspectives are heard and discussions that will shape the future. Enjoy the town hall. Welcome. I’m Daphne Kwok with AARP. Empowerment. That is why we’re all here today. And that’s why AARP so honored to be supporting APIA Votes presidential town hall as AARP works to empower people to live as they age. There are over 4.3 million AAPIs over the age of 50 now. And in 40 years, that number will go over 13 million. We are a critical block of voters. And as we all know, family is a core value for our community. That means we all need to advocate for issues to improve the lives of all of our elders, be they LGBTQ or not. This is June, which is pride month. In November, our future is on the ballot and we need to make sure language access, healthcare access, and affordability, culturally competent care, and maintaining the dignity of all of our elders is on the ballot. Today, I want to invite you to pledge with me that every single one of us will do our civic duty to not only vote for a brighter, but to make sure our families vote as well. Thank you so much. Hi, I’m Khelan Bhatia, AARP’s director of voter engagement. Thank you so much for the opportunity to sponsor your presidential forum and the opportunity to come speak to you today. AARP is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization representing people over the age of 50, the most powerful voting block in every election cycle. And during this time of COVID, the way we live our lives has changed from the way we work to the way we vote. AARP is committed to making sure you know how you can vote safely this fall and you know which issues are on the line, including social security, Medicare prescription drug prices, longterm care, and the economy. For more information, please go to aarp.org/election2020, and please remember to vote. Thank you. During the coronavirus pandemic Asian Americans rose to answer the call as frontliners, caregivers, cure-seekers, truth-tellers, providers, and modern day heroes. We can’t say enough about how grateful and proud we are of you and the work you do. And thank you to Christine, Stephen, Daphne and Khelan. Now, as you’ve heard many people mention, in just the past six months, all of us have struggled to make sense of a pandemic that has changed the way we live. And that’s taken the lives of more than 120,000 people here in the U.S., nearly 450, 000 around the world. We’ve also had to bear witness to the death of so many others stemming from police brutality. So please join me now in a moment of silence to honor those loved ones lost to both the global health crisis and to our crisis of violence. Next, we’d like to share a video. One that highlights, the work of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, or CAPAC, which was established back in 1994. Following the video, we are delighted to have with U.S. Representative Judy Chu. She was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in July 2009, and now represents the 27th congressional district in California. As the first Chinese American woman elected to Congress, Representative Chu has been the CAPAC chair since February 2011. She also serves on the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, the House Small Business Committee, and is chair of the Cub-Committee on Investigations, Oversight and Regulations. But first, to the video. In 1994, the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus was formed. Now it is my hope that this caucus will serve as a foundation for future advances for our community. Laying a groundwork for growing AAPI leadership. To finally make the full story of the Asian Pacific American communities known in Washington D.C. as well as throughout the country. We came together to have a greater voice in Washington and ultimately throughout the country. We did this with the strong belief that everybody in America benefits when those making the decisions look like America. Today, for the first time in 130 years, the House of Representatives will vote on a bill that expresses regret for the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. One of the most discriminatory acts in American history. With each passing year, our voices grow stronger on the issues we all care about. If we lose the belief that our education system can give every child a shot I think our country’s democracy is in grave danger, and that’s what I came here to fight for. If we lose sight of our nation’s founding principles, we will lose out on the innovations we’ve seen from immigrants and immigrant families. They are joined by the voices of rising new leaders. There are a lot of people who are hurting in America. And they see a system that is not working for them. I rise today in support of taking action to lower healthcare and prescription drug costs. I heard from my neighbors that they’re tired of the politics. They can’t afford the partisanship. And they need Congress to be the adults in the room and to act now. Together, we work to protect and advance the rights of all Americans and fight for the policies and needs of the AAPI community. And joining us now is Congresswoman Judy Chu. Congresswoman, over to you. Hello, everybody. First, let me say thank you to Christine Chen and APIA Vote for hosting today’s history making presidential town hall. As chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, or CAPAC, I am so gratified to see thousands of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders joining us virtually for this milestone event, ready to engage in the 2020 election. And I want to thank APIA Vote for highlighting history and growth of CAPAC through your video. You seeM it wasn’t too long ago that AAPI’s, were so invisible in the U.S. Capitol that if you saw someone walking down the halls, you just have to turn around and look, it was so unusual. But thankfully, this is not the case anymore. AAPI’s are now the fastest growing racial population in the country and the fastest growing voting block. Over the past decade, we’ve had more AAPI’s run for office and get elected than ever before. And as a result, we now have a record 20 AAPI members of Congress, our highest number in history. But not only that, AAPI’s have more than doubled our voter registration numbers over the last decade, with more than 11 million AAPI’s eligible to vote this year. And by 2044, we will have doubled even those numbers. We are also the swing vote in key swing states and districts all across the nation. And that is why I like to say we’ve gone from being marginalized, to the margin of victory. But in order to make a difference this November, we must do everything in our power to ensure that AAPI’s make our voices heard at the polls. And that’s why today’s presidential town hall is so important because the stakes have never been higher. These are difficult and sobering times with this country’s very health and economy at stake. Over 127,000 Americans are dead and over 40 million have filed for unemployment. The coronavirus has disproportionately impacted communities of color, including native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders who in California have three to four times the COVID-19 mortality rate relative to their population. Small business is the key to the American dream for so many AAPI families, and yet they are struggling to stay open with language barriers making difficult the access to Payment Protection Program loans. We are also at a critical moment in our history about inclusivity and racism. Over the past month, Americans have taken to the streets to demand justice for the shocking murder of George Floyd and so many other victims, helping to kick-start a national conversation on racism and inequality that we have not seen in decades. On top of this, the coronavirus has incited intense anti-Asian xenophobia and hate crimes over the past few months that have threatened the safety of our community. It started in January with dirty looks, insults and misinformation that Asian American restaurants and businesses were more likely to have the disease and should be avoided. But in the last few months, it’s escalated to spitting, yelling and physical attacks against Asian Americans all across the nation, including an incident in Texas, where a man stabbed three Asian Americans, including two children, ages two and six, at a Sam’s Club saying that he wanted to kill Asian-Americans. This xenophobia has been exacerbated by political leaders have used the racist term Kung Flu and Chinese Virus to refer to coronavirus, even though health experts at the CDC and World Health Organization have repeatedly warned not to associate the disease with a specific geographic location or ethnicity due to the stigma it causes and is why they officially use the scientific and neutral term COVID-19. Regardless of which candidate you support or what your political affiliation may be, we all know that violent and hateful rhetoric and policies targeting a AAPIs or any American has no place in our society. But simply condemning these remarks is not enough. We need to know what candidates will do to stop hate speech, address inequality, and protect the health and wellbeing of all Americans. Today, it is more important than ever that we elect leaders who can govern in times of crisis and move our country forward. And AAPIs can be at the forefront of this. We can register people to vote and we can get those already registered to cast their votes in November. We can exercise the true power that we have as an AAPI community to make a difference in this country. Together, we can make sure that AAPI voters are the margin of victory in November 2020 and beyond. Congresswoman Judy Chu, Thank you so much for being with us here today and for your continued leadership. Now, before we welcome our campaign speakers, we have one more short video for you. This one taps into the emerging power of the Asian American Pacific Islander electorate. Let us be clear. We may have arrived in this country at different times and under different circumstances, but one thing is certain. Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have been a part of the fabric of this country since its very beginning. We may not have always been the most visible community, but our contributions have always had an impact that far outweighs our numbers. Today, we live in a world that barely resembles what it was even six months ago. Like many Americans we face issues and challenges that deeply affect communities, from healthcare to hate crimes, from the census to social justice, from immigration to equity, our stake in the next election has never been more personal. Let us be clear. AAPIs will be a part of the solution to these challenges and we will make that difference just like we always have. Today, we are mobilizing to meet the challenges we see and our communities vote will be the difference maker. It already is in multiple key races throughout the country. We are a community that is more energized and politically active than ever before. So let us be clear. As the fastest growing group in the country, our voting power has doubled over the last decade. Our voice has never been louder and our vote has never counted for more. And that is something every candidate should be clear on. Does that get you excited for the 2020 election or what? All right, we are almost there, but we want to show you one more video, which really showcases the diverse voices from across the country and the issues that these folks want to hear from our candidates through self recorded videos. I identify with the Filipino American community. I identify with East Indian culture. I’m representing Cambodian community. I’m a Samoan American. I’m a Vietnamese American woman. I am a proud Filipina American. I identify as an Indian American. I’m a Chinese Cantonese American. I am Korean Italian American and an adoptee. I am from Campbell, California, and I’m Tongan. I’m Vietnamese American and based right here on the Gulf coast of Alabama. We represent the South Asian community for the state of Texas. My family and I immigrated from Bangladesh in the early nineties. I was born and raised in Seoul, South Korea. I’m a first generation Asian America who immigrated from Hong Kong. I belong to the Sikh community. My passion is serving and empowering my multi-generational Filipino American and API community. And I’m proud to be part of the API-SEIU Caucus. We represent the Asian American community. With the COVID-19 global pandemic and the protests over the murder of George Floyd, the political landscape has changed not only for Asian Pacific Islanders, but for everyone living in the United States. During the time of COVID-19, we’ve also seen a rise in the use of anti-China and other xenophobic messaging that has led to an increase in harassment and discrimination against Asian Americans. More recently, the Black Lives Matter movement has been heavy on my mind and how that’s hopefully ignited a revolution for the nation. So I’m looking for a candidate who will commit to these changes and will do so to protect people in my own community and the Vietnamese American community and the Southeast Asian American community. And who will also commit to the lives of folks in the Latinx community, of folks in the black community as well. Asia Pacific Americans are the fastest growing minority population in the United States, but we have particularly low civic engagement. This is something that needs to change. And that’s why I’m going to do everything I can to make sure our community votes in November. Voting in this time is the first step to not only realizing but actualizing a world where future generations can heal, prosper, and have the right to the pursuit of happiness. It belongs to me, it belongs to you. And it belongs to all of us. It belongs to the people. It has to transcend political parties. It can’t just be a conservative or liberal thing. It has to be a human thing. Part in electing individuals who will work to bring about positive change and move our nation forward. I am voting for democracy and for the candidate that is best able to make true the promise of America. So please vote this November to make a change. Thank you. All right guys. Let’s turn now to the campaigns. Now here’s how it’s going to work. In each case the candidate or surrogate will make brief opening remarks. He’ll then take questions from the moderators and from the community, some will be live, some will be taped, and of course, provide some answers. Just as a reminder we as the moderators are going to do everything we can to be respectful of everyone’s time. We ask all of you to please do the same, but without further ado, I am pleased now to introduce the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, former vice president Joe Biden. Mr. Biden, over to you. Well thank you very much. I appreciate it, and thank you all at the APIAVote, you’re all talking about voting. This organization has an opportunity for us to be together. I also want to thank Congressman Chu for her incredible leadership in the House of Representatives and for her commitment to keeping the issues that matter to members of the Asian-American Pacific Islander community top of the mind for all of us. I’d like to start today by briefly addressing what I consider to be a horrifying revelation in the New York Times last night. Assuming the Times report is accurate, the U.S. intelligence, they report, the U.S. intelligence community has assessed that a Russian military intelligence unit, the same unit that was behind the assassination of a former KGB agent in London five years ago, has been offering bounties to extremist groups in Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops. There is no bottom to the depth of Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin’s depravity if that’s true. It’s a truly shocking revelation that if the Times report is true, I emphasize again, is that President Trump, the commander in chief of the American troops serving in a dangerous theater of war, has known about this for months according to the Times, and done worse than nothing. Not only has he failed to sanction or impose any kind of consequences on Russia for this egregious violation of international law, Donald Trump has continued his embarrassing campaign of deference and debasing himself before Vladimir Putin. He has had this information according to the Times and yet he offered to host Putin in the United States and sought to invite Russia to rejoin the G7. His entire presidency has been a gift to Putin, but this is beyond the pale. It’s a betrayal of the most sacred duty we bear as a nation, to protect and equip our troops when we send them into harm’s way [inaudible 00:37:07] betrayed. It’s a betrayal of every single American family with a loved one serving in Afghanistan or anywhere overseas, and I’m quite frankly outraged by the report. If I’m elected president, make no mistake about it. Vladimir Putin will be confronted and we will impose serious costs on Russia. I don’t just think about this as a candidate for president. I think about this as a dad, a father, who sent his son to serve in harm’s way for a year in the Middle East, in Iraq, and I’m disgusted on behalf of those families whose loved ones are serving today. When your child volunteers to serve, they’re putting their life on the line for the country, they take risk, known and unknown for this nation, but they should never, never, never ever face a threat like this, with their commander in chief turning a blind eye to a foreign power putting a bounty on their heads. If I’m president, this and so many other abuses will not stand. I know this is a difficult time for our country. More than 125,000 people have died because of COVID-19, with millions more infected. More than 20 million Americans are still out of work and all of us, all of us are contending with how we can ensure a strong reopening of our economy and the many AAPI-owned small businesses across the country without endangering the safety and health of ourselves, our families, and workers across America. At the same time, during a pandemic, Donald Trump is telling his administration to “slow down testing”, ending federal funding for test sites. I understand he just reversed that today. He was going to end funding for federal test sites, but Republican governors said don’t do it, he changed his mind. Fighting in court to strip people of their healthcare under the Affordable Care Act, and on top of all of this, Asian-Americans are being targeted with violence and subjected to xenophobia rhetoric from the mouth of the president himself. This is a president who instead of bringing our country together does everything he can to fan the flames of hate and division in this country. From the moment I launched this campaign, I’ve been speaking about the battle for the soul of our nation. This is part of that battle, and in this moment of national and global crisis, where the racial inequities that plague our society are even more evident now than they’ve been. At this time we need a president who can address every aspect of this pandemic with urgency and seriousness, including anti-AAPI bias. I know Donald Trump only knows how to speak to people’s fears, not to their better angels. He only ever speaks to place blame instead of claiming responsibility. That’s not who we are. We’re so much better than this president can even conceive of us being. Just look at how the AAPI community and so many others across this nation have responded to Trump’s racist attacks during the pandemic. By stepping up, doctors, nurses, researchers, frontline healthcare workers, grocery clerks, delivery drivers, restaurant owners. They’re showing the best of America, every single day. Standing [inaudible 00:40:36], filling in for Donald Trump’s complete lack of leadership when it comes to keeping Americans safe during this pandemic. Our AAPI community is essential, period. Period. Not just as essential workers, but essential to the very fabric of this nation. The AAPI community is essential to our American story, and I’m also here today asking for your support because this isn’t just a moment of crisis. It’s an incredible opportunity to build our country back, build it back better, even stronger than it was before. You know I think the American people have had the blinders ripped off in so many ways, ready to take on the deep systemic inequities that have plagued our society for much too long. I think we’re ready to deliver some real fundamental long overdue changes. I think we’re ready to celebrate the incredible strength that we draw from our diversity and harnessing everyone’s unique talents, and I’m looking forward to working with the AAPI community to deliver the progress we need for all Americans. That’s what we did in the Obama-Biden administration. President Obama and I have fought to expand opportunity and open the doors to more Americans, including fighting for AAPI communities. We established the White House initiative on Asian-American and Pacific Islanders. We helped two million AAPI individuals gain healthcare coverage through the Affordable Care Act. We protected thousands of Asian-Pacific American Dreamers by creating and expanding the DACA program. We strengthened the crimes protection for Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders. We worked to disaggregate federal data to better meet the challenges facing the AAPI community. We secured long overdue compensation for proud Filipino veterans of World War II, and we appointed more AAPI judges to the bench than every administration in U.S. history combined. As president, I’ll build on this legacy and continue to fight for AAPI rights. I’ll make sure your voices and your interests are included from our courtrooms to the president’s cabinet. My administration will look like America. We’ll work together to ensure that the most sacred aspect of our democracy, the right to vote, is protected and accessible for all people. There’s so much, so much we can do, and it’s going to take a lot of work. It’s going to take leadership at the highest levels of our government and sustained grassroots pressure which you all provide. Nothing about this is going to be easy or automatic, but I believe we can do it together. So thank you again for having me. I’m looking forward to our conversation, and again, thank you very much for your activism. Vice President Biden, thank you so much for those remarks sir, and for being here and taking the time to answer our questions. I want to begin with one of my own if you don’t mind. Sure. You mentioned some of those systemic issues, the inequalities we’re still addressing as a nation over time and I’d like to ask you about some questions you faced about your team. During the last election cycle Democratic candidates released staff diversity data on a regular basis, almost quarterly. You haven’t released yours yet. Your seniormost advisors it’s been reported are predominantly white, there’s very few black and Latino senior advisors. My understanding is no Asian-American senior advisors, please correct me if I’m wrong, but when we look at dismantling systemic racism in America, political institutions, like campaigns, are often among the worst offenders. So what do you now say to the voters of color who worry that if you can’t lead the way on fixing this on your own team right now, then maybe you can’t lead the way on fixing it in the rest of the country, and a related question, when will you release that staff diversity data Mr. I’ll release that diversity data today. When we get off this call, we’ll call you. The fact of the matter is we have a very diverse staff and we have a diverse staff that goes across the board and high level and senior positions. So I will make sure we release it to you and it does include AAPI members as well as a significant number of African-Americans, significant number of women and Latinos. Sir just to clarify when you say that we are talking about the seniormost members of your staff, not staff overall, but people with agency who are at the decision-making table. Yes. That’s correct. That’s correct. Wonderful. Thank you very much for that and I will take that call when I get it from your teams. All right. My team has to be watching this. Thank you for that sir. Let’s turn now to some community questions. I know we have a lot [inaudible 00:45:32]. By the way, one other thing. My administration is going to look like America. Not just my staff, the administration. From the vice president straight down through cabinet members to major players within the White House and the court. It’s going to be a reflection of who we are as a nation. Okay, let’s turn now to those community questions, sir. I want to bring in now, joining on Zoom, [Jong Vang Tao 00:45:56]. He is a community organizer in Minnesota. Here is the thing to know about him, Vice President. He is as I mentioned a community organizer, he was previously incarcerated for eight years. He now works for a regional government agency. I believe he joins us now and I’m going to hand it over to him to ask his question directly to you. Okay. Hello, thank you. Last month, Minnesota and our nation was traumatized by the murder of George Floyd and the civil unrest that followed. As we all are looking for a new way forward, we must acknowledge that these events are a result of the inequities within our systems. Past policies like tough on crime legislation has led to the over-policing of poor communities, including immigrant communities, and introducing them into the [inaudible 00:46:46] pipelines. Many people like me, who have finished paying our debts to society, we often struggle to rebuild our lives and overcome systemic barriers after prison. Some have been able to find jobs and others have been left with no other options but to start a new business. Many of us have started families and became upstanding members in the community. Despite all of these accomplishments, ICE has been deporting people like us since 2002. These actions are destroying families and abandoning good people into countries that many have never stepped foot in. Issues like DACA, immigration and deportation are all critical to my community. What will you do to ensure that all communities of color, including Southeast Asians and other small ethnic groups are not left out of your discussions on which immigration reforms and policies to prioritize in your first 100 days? Thank you. Jong, thank you so much for your question. Please, Vice President Biden, over to you. By engaging your leadership, as I have through my career, just like we did in our last administration. Now this pandemic has brought out the best in so many people, doctors, nurses, first responders, grocery clerks, delivery people, caregivers, heroic soldiers in the war against the virus. So many of them are Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders, but this crisis has also brought out the worst. We’ve all heard about the horrible acts against Asian-Americans, blame for the coronavirus, harassment, violence, conspiracy theories, blaming Asian-Americans for COVID. Dangerous smears including by Donald Trump. Words matter, and the president’s words matter even more. I’m running to restore the soul of this country to make clear there’s no safe harbor here to stand up to anyone who has been left behind. As president, I’m going to fight every day to lead the change for significant change in all our policies and to make sure that every member of the diverse AAPI community is treated with dignity and has a same shot to succeed, and I’m going to make sure the AAPI community is represented in my administration. As I said under President Obama we appointed more AAPI judges than every previous administration combined, including four times more women of AAPI descent than any other president. [inaudible 00:49:08] advisory commission on AAPIs, Pacific Island taskforce, and the White House initiative on AAPIs, we held hundreds of stakeholder meetings and summits and worked with 24 federal agents, the whole committee, to make sure they had federal resources. Trump gutted all of that, and as president, I’m going to restart it and take it further. Let me go back to your comment about you having served your time in prison. We have to make a fundamental change in the way we deal with prisoners. That’s why in my view that … This is what I propose, we should turn, and I’ve been pushing this for a while now, we should turn our system into one of … From punishment to rehabilitation. Once you have served your time, right now what happens is you get 25 bucks on a bus ticket and a lot of people don’t have any place to go except back to right where they were before if they were in real trouble. I believe that you should be entitled to, anyone serving their time in prison should be entitled to every single solitary program that exists in the government, from access to housing to access to food to access to Pell grants to access to educational opportunity. It’s overwhelmingly in our interest that we do that, that we do that. There’s much more to talk about in terms of dealing with the whole notion of prison reform, but the biggest reason that we have to do is we have to make sure that people have an opportunity to have a new start. The idea that anybody … Well I won’t [inaudible 00:50:42], I get too excited about this one but there’s a lot we can do and I will do. Vice President Biden, thank you for that answer. Thank you to Jong Vang Tao for that question as well. We have more questions from the community. I’m going to hand it over now to my colleague Vicky. Thanks so much Amna. Let me just go ahead and start my video here. I’m in my back porch. Tell you what. I did not. It is the strangest time and I must say as strange as it is to be a journalist right now, it must be even more difficult and odd to be campaigning in the time of a pandemic when for months we’ve all been told to stay home. That’s right. Yet that has not stopped your opponent though. President Trump has been holding rallies, events. We haven’t seen much of you, Vice President Biden. Americans have not seen you, so as you try to convince voters to cast their ballots for you, what do you say to the Silent Majority, who see you as an extension of President Obama, representing a time when many felt like they weren’t heard, they weren’t seen. People who feel like this country is trending too far left and I have one more part to this question I want to ask you. In your first 100 days, as president, what will you do to create a pathway to citizenship for many undocumented immigrants? That is a big issue for the AAPI community. As you know, 1.7 million face deportation threats, another 100,000 are young people who are affected by the DACA program. So two parts for you, what are you going to do to be more visible and what do you say to the folks that think you’re just going to be President Obama 2. Look, I am very proud to have served with Barack and it was one the great honors in my life. I thought he was a great president, but even he acknowledges we can’t go back to what it was. We have to go back and build back better and so I have a program that is significantly different and builds upon where we left off and tries to undo the damage that Trump has done, number one. Number two, I campaign from home, about Biden hiding in his cellar. Well the truth of the matter is over 200 million people have watched me on television and they’ve watched and the more that Donald Trump is out, the worse he does. I think it’s wonderful he goes out. I’m being a bit facetious because it’s dangerous what he’s doing with these rallies, but look at, his numbers have dropped through the floor. They’ve dropped through the floor, number one. Number two, I have gone out responsibly. I go out and I wear this mask when I go out and when I go out I keep social distancing. I went to Texas to be with the Floyd family for the funeral. I went up to Pennsylvania, Lancaster yesterday to meet with a group … The day before yesterday, to meet with a group of people who in fact have Obamacare being ripped out from under them and they have pre-existing conditions in their families. I’ve been down to Virginia, I’ve been around the country, but I do it responsibly and I don’t hold rallies because it is the reason why we’re in such trouble by not listening to the experts and the scientists about social distancing and wearing masks, which I never do when I walk outside of this house. I never fail to do. Now one day, on day one, I’m going to send the legislative immigration reform bill to Congress, to provide a roadmap to citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants who contribute so much to this country including 1.7 million, 1.7 million AAPI. My immigration policy is built around keeping families together, modernizing the immigration system by keeping families, unification and diversity as pillars of our immigration system, which it used to be. Ending Trump’s cruel inhumane policy at the border to rip children from their mothers’ arms. Take immediate action to protect Dreamers, including the more than 100,000 eligible Dreamers from East and South Asia. Rescinding the un-American Muslim ban immediately. Restoring refugee admission in line with the values and historic leadership of our country, raising the target to a minimum of 125,000 people a year in my first year. He’s cut it down to 15, the average has been 95,000 a year. Working with Congress to establish bipartisan legislation to ensure a minimum admission of 95,000 refugees. That’s who we are, that’s how my great-great-grandfather … Four greats back [inaudible 00:55:29], he got in a coffin ship in the Irish sea never knowing whether he was going to make it and he made it to the United States of America in 1848 [inaudible 00:55:38]. So streaming, streamlining the naturalization process. Make it easier for qualified green card holders to move through his back law, and by the way, he just indicated … He ended H1B visas the rest of this year. That will not be in my administration. The people coming on these visas have built this country and so you ask the other parts of a question, I can’t remember what the other ones were. I can hear you. Okay, great. To send that … I have a bill written already, to send it directly to the Congress. Day one. Day one. I appreciate it. Thank you so much. Vice President Biden, we are going to ask one of our community members next to ask you a question. Her name is [Vimila Rejenjun 00:56:34]. She is going to come to us from Zoom from North Carolina. She is a chef and a small business owner. Go ahead, Vimila. I don’t see anybody on this. Oh hang on, here she is. Hang on, she’s going to unmute herself. Okay. There you go. Vimila, go for it. Hello, my name is Vimila Rejenjun as Vicky just said. I have lived in the United States for 40 years and just got naturalized as a citizen in 2019. Thanks for choosing the United States. Thanks for choosing us. Thank you and I feel so much at home here because civic engagement has always been my calling and I accidentally became a chef because of circumstances not having immigration papers to do other professional work which was in media and education. I became a chef 10 years ago and I saw the American dream be fulfilled in front of me with the coming successful award-winning chef and restaurant in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. So my representative, Congressman David Price has worked very closely with me to welcome refugees from about 19 countries right here at my restaurant and say hello and welcome home. So what we have done since COVID-19 as a small business is to reach out and continue our work to feed the hungry even though we are a for-profit business, a [inaudible 00:58:21] business that has believed in people, planet and profit and I must say that getting into business as an Asian-American woman has been really hard. Finding the capital was hard. Getting PPP right now during COVID-19 was extremely difficult. Major corporations got millions before we got our $100,000.00 which we have to spend within 24 weeks I may add. I must ask you, Vice President Joe Biden, what would you do to help us rebuild the economy so that small businesses that are family-owned and that are enriching the local economy, building the new South, because as you know, as the South goes, so goes the nation. Well first of all, when they came up with the CARES Act, the $2 trillion that was supposed to be distributed, it was … I pointed out that it was likely to be what I call the Trump corrupt recovery. 40% of the money that was supposed to go to small businesses did not go to small businesses. It went to large businesses. They don’t need the help, they’re not the ones that need the help, and there’s also the Main Street proposal that had several billions of dollars in it. Not one single penny has been distributed so far, and I suggested in the very beginning that there be a proposal that the president initiate the Defense Production Act to insist that they watch the major banks to make sure they would distribute moneys that didn’t cost them at all, they’re covered, that distribute those moneys to small businesses which are the backbone and employ more people than the major businesses do, the big businesses. Guess what happened? The fact is that it didn’t happen. They did not get it. Those big banks don’t like lending money, so if you went to a big bank to get your access to the stimulus that was provided, they would say, “Do you have an account here? What is your credit standing? Do you have a credit card?” Et cetera, that’s not supposed to be how it works and in addition you may recall the president then fired the oversight board, the individual, a person who was supposed to watch and see how each of these dollars is expended and to make sure that this … This administrator would look and make sure the program was working. He fired them. There is no inspector general that was supposed to be there. First thing I’ll do as president is appoint an inspector general to go back and look for every single penny of the money that got distributed and hold those accountable where there is violation of the rule and/or there has been any chicanery. A lot of that money has gone to the big businesses that didn’t need it and didn’t get to where it’s supposed to be, and with regard to PPP, with everything from masks all the way to making sure that you’re able to open in ways that are safe and/or keep your workforce safe. That is ridiculous that it’s not been available to you, and it’s ridiculous that the president has been AWOL, he says I take no responsibility, that’s a state responsibility. This is a war he talks about, a war against this virus, yet he’s AWOL, he does not take any responsibility. He’s leaving it to the states. Second part of what you’re saying, to make sure we meet the diverse needs of this community [inaudible 01:02:02] an administration stimulus program designing jobs programs and helping businesses get ahead. Because small businesses are the key to our recovery. You’re the foundation of the community, of this country, of the American dream and they are bearing the brunt and you are bearing the brunt of the economic crisis today, including Asian-American community. Now look, Trump’s corrupt recovery is focused on the wealthy, well-connected, not the millions of mom and pops that are out there facing ruin. As I said earlier, 40%, 40% of the funds didn’t go to small businesses at all and the Main Street lending program has lent not a single dollar. Because many of the AAPI-owned businesses are cash operated and don’t have ties to banks, [inaudible 01:02:45] this paycheck protection program, funds that Trump is supposed to be supplying through the administration, through what the Congress passed. Here’s what I’ll do for small businesses now. Provide clear, consistent guidelines for safe reopening. Get the workers free testing and PPE to stay safe. Provide an ambitious restart package to help small businesses not only be able to reopen but rehire workers and cover the extra restart expenses and fixed costs like rent. Make sure that stimulus funds are distributed fairly. As I said, I’m going to appoint an inspector general on day one to make sure the funds actually get where they’re supposed to go, reverse half of the new PPP funds for small businesses with less than 50 employees so that … Right now, a small business is technically under 500 employees. That’s not what most people think is a small business. Half those funds should go to people with less than 50 employees, and even smaller. We have to focus on you have been the heartbeat of your community and of a community and the communities across the country. The other thing is that you’re working with Congressman Price who is a first rate guy. We in fact have to increase the numbers as I said earlier of refugees able to come to the United States of America. Vice President Biden, I’m going to stop you right there just so we get time for another community question. That was great, we appreciate what you had to say on small businesses. I’m sorry. I’m going to toss it to Melissa [Leilan 01:04:23]. She is coming in with a question about healthcare. APIs, including COFAs are among the most visible of healthcare workers caring for COVID-19 patients. Pacific Islanders are contracting and dying from the virus at an alarming rate, only to be largely forgotten in discussions of community impact. COVID-19 has raised onto a pedestal health disparity for people of color including APIs. Yet access to healthcare insurance is one of the biggest barriers our communities face due to language and policy barriers. One-third of Asian-Americans have limited English skills. Free for everyone, [inaudible 01:05:25] surge the testing to make sure it reaches the community. Get critical medical supplies and care, hospitals in every part of this nation, and I would immediately drop Trump’s efforts to overturn Obamacare and strip millions of healthcare even during this pandemic. He shouldn’t be putting politics … His politics ahead of the safety of the American people and you know, one of the things you all know better than any group is that Obamacare was and is still a big deal that covered 20 million uninsured, two million formerly uninsured AAPIs. As president I’m going to build on it with a public option, slashing premiums and deductions and drug costs, automatically enrolling people who are eligible for Medicaid but live in states that reject this expansion, double the funding for community healthcare centers and frontline care, and I will work to tear down the language barriers that keep AAPI from quality care. For example, during our administration we distributed health insurance information in seven Asian languages, Burmese, Chinese, Hmong, Khmer and Vietnamese and Lao and so as president I’m going to build on that important work and direct federal agencies to find new ways to increase access to federal programs to the AAPI community, including those with limited English proficiency. To ensure that the best practices are shared across departments and agencies. Now look, that includes making sure that AAPI communities have access to information about COVID-19. So far, the Center for Disease Control materials have been translated into Spanish, Korean, Chinese, Vietnamese but other resources like those released by the White House, House Coronavirus Taskforce and other federal agencies are available only in English and Spanish. You all know the argument that most people don’t about the model minority? Well AAPI advocates across the country know that there is a section of the AA … If you take it as one big, big group, it has the highest education achievement, et cetera, but what we insist it was that we’ve … For example, at the Department of Education, integrated post and secondary education system, it should be broken down by ethnicity because it changes dramatically. This administration hadn’t done that. … this administration hadn’t done that. HHS has seven Asian Americans and four Pacific Islander breakdown in categories. Department of Labor has done the same thing. This guy’s not done that at all. So you look out and generically, you say, “Okay, the AIPI community writ large has a great achievement higher than any other group in America.” But that misrepresents the fact that scores of ethnicities are in fact really being hurt and left behind. And we’re supposed to be breaking that out so we know exactly where they are, so they can be taken care of and treated fairly. That’s one of the priorities I will have, in addition to access to eliminating the language barrier. I went really quickly because I know we’re getting out of time. I apologize. We appreciate it, thank you. Yes. … you managed to use the word chicanery, and you are going to make your diversity data public right after this town hall. We’re looking forward to it because as we’ve been saying, representation certainly matters in all facets of life, private and public. We appreciate very much your time today. And we’re going to continue. By the way, this isn’t the end of the diversity. This is just the beginning and I said, the administration will look like it. So thank you very much. Thank you. Appreciate it. And I’m going to now transition. I’ll let you go, Vice President Biden. We’re actually now going to bring in someone from the Trump campaign. We do not have the pleasure of having the President here with us today for this town hall, but we are joined by someone equally special who will be speaking on behalf of the president. And that is Governor Eddie Baza Calvo. He has been the Governor of Guam since January of 2011. Governor Calvo has worked in the private sector as the General Manager for both the Pacific Construction Company and the Pepsi Cola Bottling Company of Guam. He’s from my neck of the woods. He is a graduate of the College of Notre Dame in Belmont, California, and he and his wife, Christine, have six children. I’d like to welcome you, Governor Calvo. I can hear you fine. And by the way, good morning from Guam. Good morning. It’s just about six in the morning. Wow, you got up really early for us. … I’m going to greet you, and for all our Asian American Pacific Islanders, I’m going to greet you in our language and a bunch of others. [foreign language 00:02: 30]. Impressive. Thank you, Governor. So let me ask you, President Trump, he continues to call the coronavirus, the Kung flu. He has objected to having a Black Lives Matter mural on Fifth Avenue in front of his building. As you heard Representative Chu saying earlier, the hate incidents against Asian Americans has gone up tremendously since the coronavirus started, and since we started hearing terms like China virus, Kung flu. Some are saying the president’s going back to his 2016 playbook of using divisive language to appeal to his base. And a recent poll shows that Americans are the unhappiest they’ve been in nearly 50 years, in part because of the lockdowns and the pandemic. The President says he wants to keep America great, but his track record indicates he’s more of a divider than a uniter. How will he try to bring Americans together in his second term? And if he is reelected, what commitment will President Trump make to a diverse cabinet and appointees who have a history of understanding and representing AAPI communities. Amazing you mentioned the word Kung flu. As a matter of fact, if you can take a look at history, that Kung flu comment even came from the Obama administration. That’s not true, sir. That’s not true, sir. I will say, Governor, it actually came from people who were waging a public health campaign. It was not linked to the Obama campaign. It was used twice during his presidency when public health agencies were trying to fight the flu. If you can please allow me to continue, but again, it came within the Obama administration. I can tell you with inclusion within the Trump campaign, I’m a part of it. If you look at the representation and whether it’s on the White House Advisory Commission, Asia Pacific Affairs, my chair is Elaine Chao. So I’m here as an Asian American and Pacific Islander to represent the Trump campaign. And I got to tell you something about these division. If you take a look at what is happening throughout this nation, and you look at some of the events, and by the way, as a member of the White House Commission, I’ve seen what is the impact on some of our Korean American stores, our Vietnamese hair and nail shops, our Filipino restaurants that have been looted and people robbed as a result of the riots. And I can tell you that when you look at the destruction and whether it’s from looting, whether it’s robbing, or burning flags, or tearing down statues, most of those people, not all, aren’t going to vote for President Trump. Many of them actually are supporters of the Biden campaign. So as you talk about division, I think maybe especially those within the Biden campaign, got to look in a mirror because a lot of their supporters are the ones that are responsible for this. So I hope I’ve answered that question. Much of the damage is not happening from MAGA or Trump supporters. I think words, you got to be very careful on words. And I got to tell you my president, he sometimes very unorthodox and he uses certain words, but you also got to look at actions. And when you take a look at the actions of the Trump administration, whether it’s my participation or Secretary Chao, or as a matter of fact, as we go into housing, some of the great ideas that have come from again, Ben Carson, who is Secretary of HUD and many others, you already see participation, whether it’s from Asian Americans or Pacific Islanders. I’ve got to tell you in our advisory commission, and I’m talking to White House Advisory Commission on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, you got two folks from the islands, actually three, two from Guam, one from Samoa. It’s interesting how it expanded as well, because not only do you have Asian American Pacific Islanders from American Samoa, Hawaii and Guam and the Northern Mariana’s, but within this administration, there actually been an expansion to our compact states. And these are nation states that have a very intimate relation with the United States. And I talk about the Republic of the Marshall Islands. I talk about the Republic of Palau, and I talk about the Federated States of Micronesia, which encompass an area of the Pacific larger than the United States. And it’s in the Trump White House, that there is actually an effort to work with not only the Asian American Pacific Islanders within America itself, but even with our special partners, such as a compact states, which have a very deep and intimate relationship with the United States. So again, that’s another first for the Trump administration. He’s already doing it from home. I’m sorry. I think someone’s speaking over you. Yes. We had a commencement speech at our University of Guam here and it was virtual and it was spoken to these 500 new graduates of University of Guam. This is a young Korean woman that was born and raised in Guam. Her family immigrated to Guam years ago. She’s Korean American and a proud Guamanian. And just several weeks ago, with President Trump appointing her as an ambassador and the Senate ratifying it, she became the first Guamanian to serve, and the newest Ambassador to the Counselor Core of the United States of the Diplomatic Corps. So that’s just another first for the Trump administration. I can’t predict who the president is going to appoint in major cabinet positions. But I can tell you, I’ve seen in my visits to the White House and meeting with those that are a part of the administration, and whether it’s in an official capacity, or even in the campaign, I’m seeing a growing diversity. I’ve seen a heck of a lot more even African-Americans that are part of the campaign. I’ve seen a lot more Hispanics and of course Asian-Americans as well. So I’m very confident about things. And again, in the weeks ahead, I’m pretty sure that the president and his people will announce any other types or any other new prospective cabinet members. And again, by the way, I’m one of them. Yes, indeed. I want to be given this … I want to be thank the president for giving me this opportunity to speak on his behalf. Because really, if you look at Guam, it’s a Pacific Island, but it’s just due South of Japan. So I am an Asian Pacific Islander. I fit every part of the category and I’ve got about six different ethnicities running through my blood. I’ve seen more diversity coming in the second part of the Trump administration as well. Thank you. We have several questions from the community for you, but forgive me. I was so excited to get to your questions, I forgot to have you do your opening statement. And it’s so early over there in Guam, thank you for waking up early to join us here in the US, on the mainland I should say. So please, if you would just open up and let us know what to expect from the Trump 2020 campaign, please. Thank you so much for that introduction. Hey, and I told you earlier, I’ve given the greetings of several languages that make the constituency of the people of warm. I can’t forget my fellow American Pacific Islanders. So as I greet you all, I’d also like to say to my Samoan brothers and sisters [foreign language 00:11:51] and also to my friends and neighbors from Hawaii, Aloha. I want to thank President Trump and his campaign team, as well as the organizers of the Asian Pacific Islanders American voters presidential town hall for giving me this opportunity to speak in behalf of President Trump and Mike Pence. I’d also like to acknowledge and thank our former Vice President, Joe Biden, Congresswoman Judy Chu, and thank them, not only their presence, but also their public service. Now for many Americans, most of their knowledge of Guam came in August of 2017 because that’s a date that North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un announced to the nation and the world that he would be launching ballistic missiles in our direction. Now what most Americans didn’t know is that threat was just the latest in a long series of escalating rhetoric and militaristic activities that had been building up since 2012. I came in in January of 2011, so most of my term was filled by threats by Kim Jong Un. Now my perspective of a belligerent North Korea is rather unique. See, I had the opportunity to serve as a governor of an American territory that was targeted by an adversary of the United States, both within the terms of former Vice President Biden, and then the first two years of President Trump. Under the previous administration, from 2012 to 2016, every year the threats coming from North Korea became more and more bellicose. Every year from 2012 to 2016, the underground nuclear testing became more and more frequent and a stronger magnitude. In fact, even some experts suspected that there may have been thermonuclear destinations. Now with those bigger explosions also came ballistic missile testing with longer and longer trajectories. Now it came to a point that not only Guam, Hawaii, and Alaska were within the bullseye, but also potentially the States within the contiguous 48 in the North American continent. Now then came President Trump. Now President Trump may not have drawn a line in the sand, but he’d definitely drawn a line in the deep blue Pacific. No American territory or state would be threatened or attacked. And if this warning was not heeded then the consequences to North Korea would be catastrophic. Now that president’s blunt warning was also coupled with crippling sanctions, and it is ironic, but also with personal engagement with Chairman Kim. Now the end result as I left public office is that those incendiary threats ended. Nuclear testing ceased. And there are no more missile flights in a direction of Guam, Hawaii, or the mainland. But I’d like to give you another perspective of President Trump, and it’s also on his handling of the North Korean crisis, but I think it’s very important. You know what? As the president completed that exhausting summit with Chairman Kim in Singapore, he stopped by Guam on his way back to Washington DC. And I still remember quite clearly my meeting with him on Air Force One. And though he hadn’t rested from his marathon summit, he needed to ask me something very important. So the first thing the president asked me when we greeted, in the typical Trump way, “Governor, how are the people of Guam doing?” Are they fearful? I said, “No, Mr. President. There are no more threats. There are no more tests. People doing okay.” And then he gave that smile and that kind of confident, Trumpian affirmative nod and he said, “Good. Now the reason why I bring this up and why it’s relevant to each and every one of our Asian Pacific American constituents, is it because it tells a true story behind that Trump presidency. And what I think is so unique and special. Now, all you folks, a lot of folks freaked out about the Tulsa rally. Some said, “Dangerous.” “Too little people.” But I hope they listened to the context of it because folks like me, who’ve been in politics for 20 years, I got to admit it, when I listened to that speech, he is probably one of the most unorthodox presidents that I’ve ever seen in my lifetime. But while some may question or disagree with his style, the results speak for themselves. Now, the clarity of what President Trump is all about for me was made manifest by one statement made at the rally. And I remember it because it’s stuck to me, “I’m campaigning for the forgotten.” That’s what he bellowed up and it made it all very clear to me. Now I’m going to give folks a little geography and history lesson. Guam is the furthest American soil from our nation’s center of power in DC. We’re a small US Territory, and our 168,000 citizens aren’t even eligible to vote for a president. And yet he’s called me here to represent the people, his campaign. But if there’s any one place in America that I guess could be described as forgotten, that could be Guam. This president, who as his aide’s told me, had not slept in nearly 20 hours, had to stop by in Guam, not just to see me, but more importantly to inquire if our people were still living in fear. And that’s probably why I witnessed more progress in our dealings with the federal government in two years working with the Trump administration, then six years under the previous Democrat administration. Whether it was increased Medicare reimbursements to our public hospital, treating with Medicaid federal matching on par with subsidies provided to States, relief from federal edicts and lawsuits … and there were a lot of them under the Obama administration … lower taxes, and opening up of economic opportunity zones. Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have gone too long as the forgotten ones. Well, President Trump changed that and in President Trump’s first term pre-COVID-19 Asian Pacific American entrepreneurship and jobs had grown, unemployment had dropped to record lows. And even with our nation in the throws of a pandemic, President Trump assigned into law direct funding for subsidizing the unemployed, providing financial assistance to businesses hit hard as a result of the shutdown, and is paving the way for reopening the economy and stimulating record growth in these months and years ahead. But before I close, I want to just comment on some of the tragic events. I’m thousands of miles away, so I’m watching on TV. And starting with that senseless murder of George Floyd and what led afterwards, the sadness, the mourning, the outcry, division, violence, destruction that seems to be engulfing our nation. Here in Guam there is no majority. Like I said, I got five or six races within my blood. But we’re rather a compilation of minorities that did hold silent protests and they were held because from every ethnicity in Guam, just to put a focus on a just cause because of that evil act of somebody in a position of power and authority abusing his power and taking the life of his fellow man. But you know what? Here in Guam, there was no violence, there was no destruction, and there was no burning of an American flag. You see in Guam, for a lot of folks there’s a reverence held to that flag, particularly the elderly, for the stars and strikes. So maybe it has a lot to do with our tragic history. I’m almost finished, but let me tell you our history. Seventy-six years ago, the penalty for any Guamanian possessing an American flag was to get their heads chopped off. The reason being was Guam was under enemy occupation. And I’m blessed that both my parents are still alive, but after all these years, they still remember that fateful day in December eighth when our island was bombed and invaded. They remember three long years of Imperial occupation. They remember the slave labor. They remember the beatings and the executions, and they remember that gnawing raw emotion of fear. They woke up with that fear. It went through the whole day until the quiet of night. This island, that was consumed with fear, there was a bunch of people that still held onto an American flag. That flag was folded, it was hidden with great care, and it was preserved. All of this done despite the extreme consequences of death if caught. Now when some of these [foreign language 00:20:53], the elderly, were asked why, was because that American flag represented hope. It was a symbol of America. And for the Chamorros of Guam, I’m a Chamorro, that flag gave us that slim hope to persevere and endure from one day to the next that someday America would return and would free our people from rape, enslavement, and death. Now those Guam survivors of World War II, or those democracy protesters in Hong Kong, who came out in the thousands waving the American flag, all those Iranian college students, where the mullahs had put the flag on the pavement, who refused to step on it and desecrate it, we all have one thing in common, as diverse as that is. That red, white, and blue is a symbol of America. America is a symbol for their hope. And that’s why that flag is cherished and honored by such a diverse grouping of citizens throughout the globe. And for those around the world that hold that hope, that’s what America symbolizes. And I got to tell you, cause I got a lot of friends out here, that are non-citizens in Guam, the pictures of American citizens wrapping, burning flags around statues is perplexing and troubling. But for President Trump, that American flag and what it stands for is still worth it. It’s worth cherishing and honoring. America is great. And if you reelect Donald Trump as our president, America will continue to prosper and to be that beacon of hope and greatness for the world. So thank you, God bless America and God bless those stars and stripes. Governor Calvo, thank you very much for giving us some insight into your role and your connection to President Trump, as you call him, an unorthodox leader. I want to turn it over to one of our questioners, her name is Kim Dinh, she comes to us from Pittsburgh and she is an immigrant rights advocate. She worked at the Pennsylvania Immigration and Citizenship Coalition. And Kim, I think you’re there. Would love for you to go ahead and ask your question live if you are ready. Yes, I see you. Take it away. Thanks. Hi, my name is Kim. I am an immigrant rights and workers’ rights advocate working and living in Pennsylvania. I work with diverse communities, including immigrants and refugees from many different backgrounds, as well as low income Asian and Pacific Islander workers. And so in recent weeks, of course we’ve witnessed COVID-19 related xenophobia, hate, rising unemployment, rising evictions, foreclosures. We’ve seen healthcare gaps, continued incarceration and detention of people despite the public health crisis. And of course the violence perpetrated by the police against Black and brown people. And all of this is not new. They are not separate issues. This global pandemic just exposes a huge and existing crisis in America of systemic racism and poverty. There are so many injustices that I see, and I truly believe that all of our injustices are linked as dispossessed people. So my question today is what concrete steps and specific policy changes will President Trump, if reelected, make in his first 100 days to end this cycle of hate, oppression, and systemic racism of people, including Asian American and Pacific Islanders? Thank you. Thank you so much. And again, as I’ve mentioned earlier, I’ve seen it firsthand with President Trump and his vision for racism-free America. President Trump believes in the people. He doesn’t believe in whatever color it is, whether you can vote or not for president. I mentioned even our young Ambassador Kim. I think when you take a look at what President Trump is doing, certain steps he’s pushing for, he’s pushing for school choice. Because he believes that the educational opportunities of those living in these traditional underserved communities, that’s a … you talk about the systemic racism or corruption? Well, some of these failing school systems, he would like to see those people living in these communities have the school choice for themselves, so that they can put their children into the school they believe is best for them. It’s interesting listening to Vice President Biden. When President Trump signed the Juvenile Justice Reform Act a lot of what that did was to fix the problems that were created by then Senator Biden when he pushed for that crimes bill. And once that crimes bill was passed in 1994 I believe, that was a one way path for so many of our minorities to prison. Now, when you go to look at the details of this criminal justice reform, well, you’re eliminating the three strikes, you’re giving more flexibility to judges to make decisions on whether incarceration is even necessary. I got to admit it, I took advantage as a governor. I saw the graduates out of our prison there. There was a group of women that had taken construction and heavy equipment classes, and a lot of it, that was the vision of President Trump. He’s even expanded the Pell grants to help for the education of the clients in prisons. Heck, there’s even partly the identifying of those prisoners coming out so that they have a job when they get in. With President Trump there is much that he has done in regards to the … you know, I’m going to talk about systemic racism because he’s done a lot. But I think when you get to the heart of the matter, it was best said … a lot of stuff could be done at the federal level, but what can be done is most important in the local level. And there was a interview made by the former Mayor of Baltimore, and it was her disappointment … there was a policing bill that was coming out. As a matter of fact, President Trump had championed a police reform bill that would give incentives the payment of body cams, the incentives for training, for use of non-choke holds unless the life of a policeman was threatened, the mining and collection of data to track bad apples. And, but I remember, it again, the Congress, if failed. God bless Senator Scott, President Trump was with him, but he couldn’t get through the Senate. But there was a statement made by the former mayor of Baltimore, and I can recall she said it has to happen in the local level. And you got to clean out this racist, or this corruption that’s within the system. And let me tell you, you have the City of Minneapolis that hasn’t had a Republican mayor since 1972. That’s [inaudible 00:28:49]. You have the City of Atlanta that has not elected a Republican mayor since 1878. And by the way, history, Guam was still a part of the Spanish Empire in 1878. St. Louis, the murder capital of America, it last elected a Republican mayor in 1944. World War II was raging and Guam at that time was part of the Empire of Japan. We seem to be in the middle of all these great empires. Chicago, the city with enough murders to be considered a war zone hasn’t had a Republican mayor since 1931, the height of the Great Depression. President Trump … let me continue. President Trump and Republican Party aren’t to blame for the catastrophic failures of these American cities. I’ll be blunt, the sole responsibility lies in those Democratic Party bosses that have had control of some of these cities, not only for decades, but for centuries. The Soviet Union I can recall had one party rule, but it was only for 72 years. Atlanta’s had it for 140. So if there’s anyone that has blood in their hands, it’s those leaders, from the murders, the looting, the anarchy that has arisen. … murder and anarchy. … it’s been the supporters of Joe Biden that have been responsible for this. And it’s those party bosses that have perpetuated control of these cities for decades and centuries. And Governor Calvo, just let’s be clear [crosstalk 00:30:24]. I’m almost over. If, I think President Trump, we reelect him, that’ll be the first big step in getting rid of the systemic corruption. But this election, you got to get rid of those party bosses that go to the same cocktail parties, the same fundraisers, the same conventions, that have control of these cities that are collapsing. And that all came from the democratic corruption in these cities, these cities that were controlled by the Democrats for decades, if not centuries. Okay. Governor Calvo, let’s get back on track here. I was on track. … we don’t know who … I mean on track in terms of answering the questions from the community, which is why we are here. And I do want to make it clear the protesters, we don’t know who they’re voting for. This is your opportunity to speak on behalf of the Trump campaign to this group of AAPI voters, which is the largest and fastest growing group of minority voters. I just got to correct. I think my reading of the graffiti, I don’t see much love letters to President Trump. There was some graffiti, pretty explicit. Okay, continue. Let’s go ahead and bring in Shenlin Chen. She is joining us from Detroit, Michigan. Shenlin, are you there? We’re happy that you’re taking part in this town hall and you have a question for the Trump campaign. And there you are. Fantastic. If you can hear us, please go ahead and take it away. I know you are the President of the Association of Chinese Americans. Thanks for joining us. Hi, Governor Calvo. Good morning. Hi. Good morning to you. [foreign language 01:39:57]. Well, it’s an honor to me [inaudible 00:32:00]. I’m Shenlin Chen from Detroit, Michigan. I am the President of the Association of Chinese Americans. And thank you for taking questions from the community. Detroit is home to Vincent Chin, a victim of a hate crime and racial killing 38 years ago just this past Tuesday. Today, the AAPI community is once again being targeted. We are being wrongfully blamed for the spread of COVID-19 despite our efforts, including some loss of lives to fight a pandemic on the front line. And also Asian Americans have been identified as a model minority. However, one third, like someone mentioned earlier, one third of our population is limited English proficiency, and a half of them is foreign born. In our work we see many underprivileged families and individuals, especially seniors, immigrants, are afraid of getting sick or receiving treatment they need to have in hospital due to the lack of health insurance and essential language support. So my question for you, and I know that you have mentioned somewhat earlier, but would you please elaborate a little bit on what are the plans at national and federal level to ensure that all AAPI Americans can obtain affordable health coverage? So either Medicaid or marketplace, with appropriate language assistance as a priority in your administration. And if elected, what specific actions will you take to help unify Americans and what message will you send to help the country heal physically and emotionally? Thank you. Okay. Thank you so much. But it’s ironic, you mentioned Detroit and I hate to rub it into the Democratic Party bosses, but the last time Detroit had a Republican mayor I think it was 1962. So again, some of the systemic issues of corruption you see in Detroit has to do with the same folks that meet with President Biden in the convention that are held by the Democratic Party. Those are held by the democratic party. When it comes to COVID response, if you take a look at the unprecedented efforts in terms of healthcare, the president invested $2 billion in community health centers, helping 28 million patients, a lot of them minority and Asian American Pacific Islanders. The president signed legislation to guarantee Coronavirus testing free of cost-sharing, removing financial obstacles for Americans who would otherwise be unable to access them. $2 billion was devoted to support hospitals with high COVID-19 admissions based on their Medicare and Medicaid disproportionate share and uncompensated care payments. The federal government is also covering the cost of coronavirus treatment for those that can’t afford it. In healthcare, also I’m looking at the most vulnerable. The president is committed to protecting Americans with preexisting conditions. The president has signed into law historic right to try legislation, which is giving the terminally ill patients hope that they can try new experimental drugs. The president signed into law the Childhood Cancer STAR Act, and that gives about $30 million every year for child cancer research. The vice president mentioned Obamacare and folks, you’ve got to recall, and you look at the historic fact of Obamacare. The last three years of Obamacare under President Obama, the cost of premiums went up by 34%. A lot of that were on drugs and by the way, I’m in the insurance industry. The administration, I guess they made their deal with the lawyers and with big pharma, so the scapegoat were the insurance companies, the only group that tries to do the managing and ensuring there’s a check and balance so that the healthcare providers and the drug companies aren’t gagging us with prices that are going up. So, what President Trump has done in focusing on bringing the drugs down prices, FDA has approved a record number of generic drugs for every year of the Trump presidency. The increase in generic drug use by Americans has saved about $26 billion for the first two years of the Trump administration. The president signed legislation eliminating the pharma gag clause. What the gag clause is with pharmaceuticals or with pharmacies, the gag clause prevented pharmacists from telling consumers about the lower price alternatives to expensive drugs. Now, the president is also pushing for drug makers to show their prices on ads and taking steps towards importing less expensive drugs from Canada. If there’s any big difference between what the president is moving on and Obamacare, it’s about choice. Obamacare is about single-payer, and we tell you what to do and what to use. This administration expanded the use of short-term limited-duration health insurance plans, STLDs, which offer more choices at lower cost to consumers. The administration has expanded access to association health plans. They’re called AHPs. Now, that makes it easier for small businesses to band together, to offer better insurance and lower premiums. A lot of our Asian American businesses, Pacific Islanders, are small. So, this allows them, similar to a co-op, to come together, to band together, to buy insurance plans. The administration also expanded the health reimbursement arrangements. Those are called HRAs. Now, this is interesting. It allows employees to use money from their employer to buy the insurance of their choice. So, you’re working from somebody, that company is already providing a certain amount of money for insurance. Well, it’s just saying, “Hey, we’ll take that money and let us” and I’m talking the employee, “make that decision. President Trump, what I like about him, he understands the intricacies of these complex issues and is able to address those challenges and provide the meaningful and effective policies to ensure that Asian American and Pacific Islander communities are treated equally. But what I like, especially about the Trump administration, I look back as a governor. It seemed from the previous administration everything came from the top. That template from Washington, DC, that way of doing things was thrown to everybody. And whether it’s New York City, or Agaña, Guam, the Trump administration is different. It’s about more focusing on autonomy, decision-making at a local level. So, that, in a nutshell, is a little bit of what’s going to be happening, what’s happening, and what we plan to see expand with President Trump reelected. Governor, thank you for that information about the HR raise and the expanded access to those association health plans. We appreciate that take. I imagine it must be a little bit difficult to speak on behalf of someone else. I’m going to turn it over now to co-moderator, Amna Nawaz, with a few more questions from the community. Amna, go ahead. Thank you so much, Vicky. Governor Calvo, It is a pleasure to meet you. Thank you so much for being here. Before we go back to some additional questions from the community, I do have one of my own if you can indulge me. Sure. We are, as I mentioned, so grateful you took the time to be here, but we should note that President Trump opted not to come nor to send a video message, instead to send you as surrogate. According to the press reports, it appears he went golfing today, and according to his Twitter account, he’s been tweeting about healthcare, the affordable care act and retweeting some QAnon conspiracy theorist accounts. I thought he made it very clear to me, and it was directed to me. This organization is Asian America Pacific Islanders. I’m thankful that the vice president has come here, but he’s not Asian American, nor is he Pacific Islander. I think it was important for the Trump campaign to have someone here that represented. You talked earlier about representation in the cabinet. Well, what better to represent the Trump campaign from a guy from Guam who lives directly South of Tokyo, who has Spanish, Chamorro, Filipino, a little bit of Chinese blood? So, in reality, I guess I represent a microcosm of the Trump campaign, and what better person to speak for President Trump on Asian American and Pacific Islander affairs than an Asian American from the Pacific Island of Guam? That’s my take on it. Well, just to follow up on that, sir, if you don’t mind. Many people saw Mr. Biden’s participation here as an acknowledgment of the growing importance of this community’s voice and the chance to court them directly. Yeah. Well, one thing, it’s virtual. I guess, here I am. It’s virtual. In fact, the vice president was virtual too. I can’t tell you … I know there’s been a lot of people criticizing President Trump, but he doesn’t stay in a basement. He goes out there. And by the way, the folks that go to these rallies or these meetings that we’ve had, they’re Asian American, and you only see them in real life. It’s not to a screen. So, again, for all my Asian American Pacific Islander friends, there’s the optics, like I said, of you thinking that he’s not here, but then there’s the reality that he’s out there. Well, you’re saying he went to a golf course, but I do know with President Trump every day he’s actually going out and meeting the people and he’s not afraid to answer tough questions. He’s not hidden in a basement. So, I want you all folks you to know that President Trump has so much confidence in Asian American Pacific Islanders, that he appoints me to be a surrogate, an Asian American Pacific Islander. Have confidence in President Trump because you know what? He doesn’t forget the forgotten ones like the previous administration. He’ll remember us. That’s my answer. Thank you for that, Governor Calvo. I do want to bring in some more questions from the community. Sure. We have some folks waiting, I believe, to get in here. May yer Thao will be delivering our next question. I hope that May yer can hear me. If you can, please do go ahead and put your question to Governor Calvo. Thank you. Good afternoon, governor, or rather, good morning. My name is May yer Thao and I am a Hmong American from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, representing the Asian American Pacific Islander Coalition of Wisconsin. I was the first in my family to have been born here in this country. My parents and my older siblings came as refugees from the Vietnam War, and a quick little-known fact, the Hmong assisted the CIA during the Vietnam War in Laos. Thus, how we came to be in this country. Governor, much of my career has been spent in economic development and in affordable housing, especially in underserved communities, such as our AAPI communities. So, as you can imagine, I’ve seen great disparities in these underserved communities in both of these arenas. Especially during this pandemic, our AAPI businesses have suffered greatly because AAPIs have been unfairly blamed for the virus. So, this has been a hard hit on our AAPI communities, but also, nearly three-quarters of our AAPIs who currently live in poverty already continue to face extended unemployment. So, my question is, what steps will President Trump take to ensure that our AAPI communities are included in the economic recovery and growth efforts? Thank you. Before I get into my answer, there’s another member of the advisory commission, a fellow named Pastor Herman Martir, and I’ve never had the opportunity to meet someone personally from the Hmong community, but in several of our meetings, the focus of the pastor has been the Hmong community and how to get the needed assistance to them. So, you have an advocate in Herman Martir. A little bit of history too, Guam has always been … it seems to be the place where, when some war happens and those that aided America are in trouble, we seem to be that conduit. In the fall of Saigon, 100,000 Vietnamese came through Guam and were put up in camps here. As a matter of fact, some of them chose to live in Guam, raise their families. My God brother is married to a refugee from Vietnam. Then, of course, many traveled or made their way back to the United States. Would you believe the Kurds even were in Guam? I still remember in the 1990s where our neighbors there was about five or 6,000 Kurds that came through here. So, many people don’t know about Guam, but a lot of our immigrants and those refugees have come to our island, fleeing the ravages of war. Now, all of America, including my island home prior to COVID-19, were enjoying record economic job growth. There was business creation and record unemployment. The same successes were also current within the Asian American Pacific Islander community, and then that pandemic hit. Even in Guam, we were at 4%. United States was at, I think, three and a half percent, but what President Trump did, he provided rapid and unprecedented support. The Island of Guam in itself got a billion dollars in federal assistance. Now, the White House also provided more than half a million African Americans, Hispanics, and other minorities comprehensive, direct updates on preparedness, response, and mitigation. The president directed the White House opportunity and revitalization council to focus on the underserved communities impacted by the virus. President signed the legislation that provided $60 billion in loans under the paycheck protection program and targeted a lot of it to support the minority and disadvantaged communities. US department of education temporarily delayed student loan repayment and held interest rates to zero. Thank goodness, I got six kids, and by the way, the last one just graduated two weeks ago. So, I saw for her, there was a break and she doesn’t have to make her first payment. You don’t have to worry about it this year. So, they also provided $6 billion in emergency assistance to the students. The president signed into law $1 billion in funding for historically black colleges and universities, Hispanic-serving institutions, and many other minority-serving institutions that have been hit hard by the pandemic. The president signed into law $3.5 billion to keep the childcare centers open for low-income families and for the frontline workers. The president halted evictions on federal government-assisted housing and temporally prevented the foreclosures for some of those FHA insured mortgages. So, the president’s record is clear when it comes to assisting the minority communities and he continues to deliver results in a way, which I believe will benefit all AAPI communities throughout our nation. With him re-elected, it’ll just get better. Governor Calvo, we thank you for that. We also thank May yer Thao for her question. I want to play for you one more question. This one’s going to come via video. It was submitted from Munir Meghjani. He’s a resident of Georgia. I believe we have that video ready now, and here is Munir’s question. Hi. My name is Munir Meghjani. I’m a commercial real estate agent and entrepreneur based out of Atlanta, Georgia. My parents immigrated from India and Pakistan before I had even learned to walk in hopes of a better future for me. They made sacrifices, tearing away from their family and loved ones, and swallowed their pride and education, working physically excruciating and minimum wage jobs. While this is my story, the truth is this is not a unique one. It’s the story of every immigrant who makes unbelievable sacrifices, not for themselves, but for the generations to come. We were still lucky. I had my parents nearby. As I look at what’s going on at the border, my heart aches for those families being torn apart. For Asian Americans in the United States, DACA, family reunification, work visas, and deportation are all very critical issues. Things to the sacrifices made by my parents and all of those who came before them, I get to stand here today and ask you, not only on behalf of my family but for all who’ve had a similar journey, what immigration policies will you champion and what laws will you change that are currently separating American families? And will these be part of your first 100-day priorities? Thank you, and good luck. I’m going to answer it and I’m going to touch on several topics, but I want to touch on the most controversial one first, and then I’ll get into DACA, and that’s the wall. It has caused a lot of controversy in the United States, this building a wall on American’s Southern border. Now, would you believe that what happens between Mexico and the United States, that Mexican American border has a profound impact on places such as Guam, such as the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana, such as Hawaii? You’re probably wondering to yourself, “How can this be? How can something that’s happening in a desert somewhere in the Southwest, have anything to do with Guam or the islands?” But it does. And there’s thousands and thousands of our families here in the islands that are suffering as a result of what is happening, destroying lives. I’ll tell you a simple reason why. It’s because millions and millions of dollars’ worth of crystal methamphetamine and cocaine are transported. It’s crazy hard to believe, but usually through the postal service or through shipping companies that are American flagged, out to our places. You know where they come from? Places such as California, Nevada, Arizona, and Colorado. Now, those American states aren’t where these deadly drugs are produced. All these drugs for years have come through those porous borders. They come North, they hit those states, and they pollute the families in those states, and then they’re sent to Guam. This year alone, officers … and for you folks that want to defund customs and border patrol, they seized 450,000 pounds of drugs. That includes 92,000 pounds of crystal meth. Some of that shit could have come to Guam. Over 1000 pounds of fentanyl, nearly 3000 pounds of heroin, and almost 25,000 pounds of cocaine. We had cocaine floating in a barrel here in Guam. Thank you, and I don’t know what state that was sent from. Border officers have arrested and apprehended thousands of criminals at the border including members of the MS-13 gang. So, you see, President Trump is committed to securing our borders from drugs, gangs, and human trafficking. Now, some of the issues about workplace abuse, well, they come because of undocumented immigrants that snuck through and that are forced into prostitution or slave labor by bad businesses. So, putting a wall up will solve a lot of those issues. President Trump is committed to reform, and he will prioritize bringing in highly skilled workers to grow our nation, but at the same time, he wants to protect American jobs. You know what’s interesting? I recall as governor that we had a skilled labor shortage and Guam’s only got 8% of our workforce in construction. We got about a billion dollars in just military construction a year for the next three years. We don’t have enough workers. We graduate maybe a hundred out of our schools a year, but that’s not enough to fill the demand. So, it was on the Obama administration that a radical 180-degree turn was on H2s and H1s. So, 25% of our construction workforce was wiped out, kicked out of Guam. What it did was made the prices of housing go up by a $100,000. Of course, for the budgets of the military, they weren’t going to keep the $8.6 billion budget for the movement of marines from Okinawa to Guam. That was an act of the Obama administration. Under President Trump, there’s been actually some flexibility. Based on an understanding that there was a need to fill, some of it is because of the military-strategic importance of Guam, but we’ve got those levels of H2 workers back to what they were. Now, again, I tell you, you heard about the pause and you know what, I can understand it. From the perspective of President Trump, Guam was at 4% before. America was at 3 and a half, but now we’re at 13.5% unemployment. The story changes, at least temporarily. That’s why President Trump’s first and foremost and highest commitment is making sure that all of you … you talked about people that need a job, all Americans get their jobs first. Let’s get back to full employment, then we can move forward in pushing on expanding for work visas. If I may, I apologize for the interruption, sir. I do you want to be respectful of your time and our audiences, but just to put a finer point and follow up on what Munir was asking, you mentioned the pause on those visas, the non-immigrant work visas. We should note that Asian Americans were disproportionately affected by the president’s executive order. So, if you could very briefly just address the thousands of Asian American families who were affected by that, who will either be forced to leave or be forced to stay separated as a family. Yeah. I will reiterate, the president’s number one goal is to move and get merit-based immigration. We need skills in this nation. So, he’s been committed to getting that back. So, there has been a pause and again, there is a guarantee that once we get full employment back, they will continue. The president was very clear is it’s not about the immigrants. They’re important, but his first and foremost priority is getting Americans back to work. Whether it’s Indian American, whether it’s Chinese American, Filipino American, or Chamorro American, his first priority is getting these thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of people that are currently unemployed, these Americans back to work. Actually, sir, I apologize. We will have to leave it there. I know we’ve spent a lot of time on a lot of different topics, but we do appreciate you being here with us today and taking the time to take these questions and provide us with answers. That’s Governor Eddie Baza Calvo, governor of Guam. Thank you for waking up early to be with us today, sir. We appreciate it. Take care. Thank you so much. Now, to all of you still with us, thanks for remaining here. We do want to bring back in Christine Chen. She’s executive director of APIAVote, and she’s back with a very special message. Thank you to Amna Nawaz and Vicky Nguyen for a wonderful job of moderating our program and sharing your expertise. Also, many thanks to our sponsors, ARP, Comcast, and Nielsen for supporting not only this presidential town hall but APIAVote and the community year-round. We must also thank all those behind the scenes, producer [inaudible 00:23:57], showrunner [inaudible 02:05:58], [inaudible 00:24:00], and ACA Video. Thank you to the APIAVote staff who worked many long hours, not only on the presidential town hall and the National Asian American Pacific Islander Leadership Summit. Our interns, you have great design skills and many more of our volunteers. We also like to thank all of you who have joined us. Speaking of which, we have some of the results of the survey. We actually had over 36 States watching and taking our survey, with a core of them coming from California. We have about 62% male and 40% female, and 95% of all our attendees are registered to vote, which is amazing. Our viewership age is actually spread out evenly among the ages 18 to 65, and out of all our registered viewers, 96% plan to vote as 64% will vote by mail this year. The power is actually in your hands, ladies and gentlemen. Each and every one of you has the most influence over your friends and family. You can take action to ensure that APIs get counted this year and are heard loud and clear. There are three things you can do today. Start with your inner circle of friends and family, and use this town hall to start the conversation with them about what issues are important to them and help them connect the dots to the importance of casting that vote in November for candidates aligned to their values. Make sure they are registered. It is as easy as texting API to 788683. That is once again, texts AAPI to 788683. Share this text to five of your friends right now, and remember, tomorrow APIAVote and their network of community organizations and partners are hosting regional convenings on Sunday. You can learn how to meet others who are interested in organizing the vote in your own backyard. All next week. The national API leadership summit will feature sessions that will help provide you with the tools to get out the vote This November. Come join us online and be empowered to get engaged even further. Remember, due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, the self-response phase of the U.S. Census has been extended to October 31st. There’s still time to take the census and get counted. We cannot assume that everyone you know has completed the census or their household and that they’ve registered and are ready to cast that vote as well. So, be there to actually help them figure out that process. With that, we wish you and your friends and family well, and with this last reminder about taking the census. Thank you. Every 10 years, the U.S. Census Bureau counts everyone living in the United States, people like Mr. Lee. It doesn’t matter whether they are students, service members, renters, employees, have green cards, work visas, are undocumented, have lived here a long time, or moved here recently, or temporarily. Regardless of their age, height, income, or ethnicities, they all count. We all have unique stories that are a part of this great nation. We need to be counted, recognized as a community to have our say in how over $1.5 trillion a year in public funding is distributed for hospitals, schools, and roads for the next generation and beyond. Starting April 1st, it’s time to do your part. Fill out the census. All right, everyone. With catchy trends and fun videos, you all know TikTok is the hot new platform that young voters have taken by storm. We asked these voters to participate in our TikTok video competition to help get out the vote as a lead up to our town hall, and now we’re ready to announce the videos from our top three winners. [ Singing 02:10:19]. Girl don’t do it. It’s not worth it. I’m not going to do it girl. I was just thinking about it. I’m not going to do it. I did it. Those were incredible. Can we just agree, Vicky? I will never make a TikTok video as good as any of those. They did a fantastic job and it was fun to see. And it’s fun to see the young Asian American voters getting energized. Absolutely. Hey, we just want to take a minute now to thank everybody out there for joining us today. Thank you to those TikTok videos for sure, but thank you also, again, to the campaigns for recognizing the importance of the Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander communities. Let’s not forget, everybody, that this year in presidential battleground races in states and local races across the country, Asian American Pacific Islander voters are poised to play a pivotal role in the 2020 election. So, I just want to say it has been my honor to serve as one of your moderators today. Remember, our job as journalists is to make sure you have the information to feel empowered, to go participate in our democracy. It’s my sincere hope that we were able to do that today. So, thank you for that. Amna, as we all know, the events of the past few weeks have really underscored there’s been a formidable shift in priorities with social and racial justice taking center stage for so many of us, along with the sense that all voices are now demanding to be heard. Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are more forcefully exerting themselves throughout culture and society. We certainly hope that you’ve been inspired to use your voice in these months prior to the election. Remember, our collective voices matter. I’m Vicky Nguyen. On behalf of Amna and APIAVote, we would like to extend a huge thank you to Vice President Biden, Governor Calvo, and of course, all of you for joining us today."

Kamala Harris:              03:55 What I will say is that I [crosstalk 00:03:57]. Rachel Maddow:           03:57 Preface this, we will give you 30 seconds. We’re going to come back to you on this again in just a moment. Go for 30 seconds. Kamala Harris:              04:02 Okay. On the issue of race I couldn’t agree more that this is an issue that is still not being talked about truthfully and honestly. There is not a black man I know, be he a relative, a friend, or a coworker who has not been the subject of some form of profiling or discrimination. Kamala Harris:              04:21 Growing up my sister and I had to deal with the neighbor who told us her parents said couldn’t play with us because we were black. Kamala Harris:              04:29 I will say also that in this campaign we’ve also heard … I’m going to now direct this at Vice President Biden. I do not believe you are a racist. I agree with you when you commit yourself to the importance of finding common ground. Kamala Harris:              04:47 I also believe … It’s personal. It was actually hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country. Kamala Harris:              05:06 It was not only that but you also worked with them to oppose busing. There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools. She was bused to school every day. That little girl was me. Kamala Harris:              05:28 I will tell you that on this subject it cannot be an intellectual debate among Democrats. We have to take it seriously. We have to act swiftly. As Attorney General of California, I was very proud to put in place a requirement that all my special agents would wear body cameras and keep those cameras on. Rachel Maddow:           05:47 Senator Harris, thank you. Vice President Biden, you have been invoked. We are going to [crosstalk 00:05:53] chance to respond. Vice President Biden. Joe Biden:                     06:03 It’s a mischaracterization of my position across the board. I do not praise racists. That is not true. Number one. Number two, if we want to have this campaign litigated on who supports civil rights and whether I did or not I’m happy to do that. Joe Biden:                     06:17 I was a public defender. I didn’t become a prosecutor. I came out and I left a good law firm to become a public defender when, in fact, my city was in flames because of the assassination of Dr. King. Number one. Joe Biden:                     06:32 Now number two as the Vice President of the United States I work with a man who, in fact, we worked very hard to see to it we dealt with these issues in a major, major way. Joe Biden:                     06:44 The fact is in terms of busing the busing I never … You would have been able to go to school the same exact way because it was a local decision made by your city council. That’s fine. That’s one of the things I argued for that we should be breaking down these lines. Joe Biden:                     07:00 The bottom line here is, look, everything I’ve done in my career … I ran because of civil rights. I continue to think we have to make fundamental changes in civil rights. Those civil rights, by the way, include not just only African-Americans but the LGBT community. Kamala Harris:              07:15 Vice President Biden, do you agree today, do you agree today, that you were wrong to oppose busing in America then? Joe Biden:                     07:24 No. Kamala Harris:              07:24 Do you agree? Joe Biden:                     07:25 I did not oppose busing in America. What I opposed is busing ordered by the Department of Education. That’s what I opposed. I did not oppose … Kamala Harris:              07:34 Well, there was a failure of states to integrate public schools in America. I was part of the second class to integrate Berkeley, California public schools almost two decades after Brown v. Board of Education. Joe Biden:                     07:46 Because your city council made that decision. It was a local decision. Kamala Harris:              07:49 That’s where the federal government must step in. Joe Biden:                     07:55 [crosstalk 00:07:55]. Kamala Harris:              07:55 That’s why we have the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act. That’s why we need to pass the Equality Act. That’s why we need to pass the ERA because there are moments in history where states fail to preserve the civil rights of all people. Joe Biden:                     08:05 I have supported the ERA from the very beginning when I ran [crosstalk 00:08:09]. Chuck Todd:                  08:08 Okay. Vice President Biden, 30 seconds because I want to bring other people into this. Joe Biden:                     08:11 I supported the ERA from the very beginning. I’m the guy that extended the Voting Rights Act for 25 years. We got to the place where we got 98 of the 98 votes in the United States Senate doing it. I’ve also argued very strongly that we, in fact, deal with the notion of denying people access to the ballot box. I agree that everybody wants … Anyway, my time is up. I’m sorry. Chuck Todd:                  08:34 Thank you, Vice President. Try Rev"
"83","06-30-20"," Thanks a lot for being here. I can’t tell whether you’re smiling or not, but thanks for being here. I want to take a few minutes to tell you a little bit about what I think we should be doing right now, and then be happy to take questions. For weeks, we’ve been seeing the warning signs. Numbers don’t lie. Infection rates are now going up in more states than there are going down. More than 125,000 people in the United States have lost their lives, and those numbers and new infections continue to grow at alarming rate. And once again is confronting the simple fact that we won’t be able to solve the economic crisis without a rigorous public health approach. They’re not separable. Despite the administration’s propaganda, that their response should be a cause for celebration, despite President Trump’s requests that we should slow down testing because he thinks it makes him look bad, the COVID-19 is still here, and the daily threat to American health and prosperity is continuing. It didn’t have to be this way. Month after month, as other leaders in other countries took the necessary steps to get the virus under control, Donald Trump failed us. Month after month, as many of us urged him to step up and do his job, he failed us. Just look at the record. In January, I, along with others, sounded the alarm of the coronavirus outbreak. Trump told the country that COVID-19 is, quote, “totally under control,” and then everything will, quote, “work out well.” In February, I warned about the failure to get information that we needed from the Chinese government. What I said was the president should demand Xi produce the evidence. Demand it. Trump said, quote, “We’re in great shape.” Reported China’s president said it was, quote, “doing very well. In March, I set forth a detailed plan for 500 federally funded testing sites across the country, as well as guaranteed emergency paid leave. Later that month, I called for a full and immediate use of the Defense Production Act. Critical, critical for delivering supplies that were basically needed. Trump accused healthcare workers. How did he respond? He accused health workers of stealing your masks. That’s what he said. “Healthcare workers are stealing the masks. That’s why we don’t have them. In April, I released a plan to secure the supply chain for personal protective equipment, surge nationwide testing through a pandemic testing board, and launch a nationwide health corp to focus on contact tracing. Trump’s suggestions? Americans should inject disinfectants into their bodies. In May, I condemned the false choice between preserving public health and our economy. I urged the administration to focus on the basic public health measures, like testing, that would enable us to sustain our economic recovery. Trump’s response? He pushed for reopening without regard to safety, and called testing, quote, “frankly, overrated. This month, I outlined a path to reopen our country safely and sustainably. It provided workers, small businesses, schools, state, local governments, the tools, resources, and guidance that they would need. Trump’s proposal, he set a cutoff date for federal funding of testing sites in several states, and actually went to court to take away healthcare for 22 million people by trying to get rid of Obamacare. And now Donald Trump is in retreat. Remember, back in March, when I called, and he called, we talked about the need to act like we were at war with the virus. He called himself a war time president. Remember when he exhorted the nation to sacrifice together, and quote, ” in the face of this inevitable and invisible enemy”? What happened? Now, it’s almost July, and it seems like our war time president has surrendered, waived the white flag, and left the battlefield. Today, we’re facing a serious threat and we have to meet it. We have to meet it as one country, but the president gives no direction, and he pits us against one another. We can’t continue like this. Half recovery, and half getting worse. We can’t continue half wearing masks and half rejecting science. We can’t continue half with a plan and half just hoping for the best. We won’t defeat this virus with a piecemeal approach, lifting restrictions prematurely, increasing the volatility of the crisis, raising the likelihood of needing to reimpose restrictions. Until our science catches up to reality, until we have better treatment for those who become infected, and ultimately are safe, proven, widely available vaccines, we have to continue to do all we can, as the people in the government, to keep our fellow Americans safe and healthy. Today, I’m releasing a plan with the steps I believe Donald Trump should undertake immediately, to build on the roadmap I released back in March that would have saved lives if it had been adopted. It’s a plan to save lives in the months ahead. Once again, I encourage him to adopt this plan and in its entirety. This is too important for politics. First, testing, testing, testing. More testing is not only how you find more cases of coronavirus, Mr. President, it’s how you stop the coronavirus cases. Testing followed by rigorous contact tracing, quarantine, and isolation protocols for those who have been exposed. People aren’t waiting in lines for miles and miles long in baking hot cars for drive through nasal swabs for the fun of it. They’re doing it so they can protect themselves, but even more importantly, they know when they have this mask on, they’re protecting others. They’re protecting others. We know we’re not where we need to be in testing. There are still hospitals and nursing homes that don’t have access to the tests they need. Testing is how we see what’s happening in communities all across the country. It’s our eyes on the ground. Without that testing, we’re flying blind. That’s why it’s so important to have reliable access to testing everywhere. We need to increase federal support for testing. That includes doubling the number of drive through testing sites and keep increasing them until there are no more lines. We should create a pandemic testing board to spearhead a nationwide campaign, so every worker, every worker who’s called back to their job can have the confidence that they and their fellow workers are not infected. Experts agree that we need more contact tracers to track the path of this virus. Individual states like New York and California are already hiring and training thousands of tracers, but we need to do more, including hiring at least 100,000 federally funded workers to perform contact tracing and other public health tasks, and they should begin to be trained now. Second, every single frontline worker should have the personal protective equipment that they need to be safe. Five months into this crisis, and our healthcare workers still are forced to scramble for their own supplies, and have to reuse these masks shift after shift. Hundreds, hundreds of healthcare workers have died from COVID-19, and tens of thousands have become infected. It should be zero on both counts for these healthcare workers if they had the right equipment. You know, how are we this many months into this and still, still don’t have what we need? That’s why we have a Defense Production Act. You know, Mr. President, use your authority, Mr. President. Use it this week. Scale up the production of N95 masks. The steps you’ve taken so far haven’t gotten the job done, Mr. President. Fix the shortage of PPE for our healthcare workers before you tee off another round of golf. We can’t just look at where we are today. We’re going to need these masks and gloves and face shields for the foreseeable future, and we need to be ready. We know more is coming. Thirdly, we should be laser focused on treatments and vaccines. We should be leading a coordinated global approach on the science, not disregarding experts while pushing dangerous and disproved drugs as if they’re treatments. There’s been some progress toward treatment and vaccines, but the administration hasn’t been transparent about how they plan to manufacture enough doses to make sure there’s equitable distribution to scale. I hope they’re doing it now. I called for a while ago, they should be providing $250 million to have a plan now, exactly how they’re going to distribute this, so every American has access when and if the vaccine’s available. They may be doing it, but we have no transparency. Let us see, Mr. President. The White House should report weekly on this progress. We can’t end up in the same scratching and distribution problems that we had in testing. We need to make sure the customers aren’t being gouged by new drug and therapies in prices when they’re developed. We have to immediately restore our relationship with the World Health Organization, for all its shortcomings and missteps around COVID-19. This is why WHO was created. It is essential to coordinating the global response during a pandemic, and the United States should be leading that response as we had in the past. COVID- 19 will likely worsen at the outset of flu season this year, so we need put in place measures now, now, to ensure the seasonal flu vaccine can be ready, available, and administered safely to those who need it under social distancing guidelines, especially for seniors. Fourthly, we need real plans, real guidelines, with uniform nationwide standards, to help us chart our economic reopening. Whatever we’ve been doing now is not working. The state by state approach will only produce confusion and slow any progress. You all reported to CDC, tried to clear guidelines about what stages of reopening should look like. The administration delayed and scaled back those plans. We need clear evidence, clear evidence-based steps that states can adopt now. Both the standard must be met in order to safely proceed with further openings, and the reposition of social distancing rules when cases begin to rise. This is not rocket science. We need to support schools and childcare programs so parents, if and when they can return to work, are confident that their children will be safe and cared for. We should be holding and providing a sticker saying, safe for shoppers, a certification to stores that prove they’re minimizing their customer’s risk and exposure. We absolutely needed a clear messages from the very top of our federal government that everyone needs to wear a mask in public, period. Period. Wear a mask. It’s not just about you. It’s about your family. It’s about your neighbors. It’s about your colleagues. It’s about keeping other people safe. It helps you, yes, but it’s about keeping other people safe. It’s a simple measure. It is also one of the most effective ways we can do the right thing. It may be inconvenient. It may be uncomfortable. But it’s the right thing to do as an American. Protect your coworkers and neighbors. And finally, we need to protect the populations most at risk, our seniors, our black and brown populations, native communities that are being hit the hardest, vulnerable populations with preexisting conditions. Know that this continued growth in case numbers is causing a lot of fear and anxiety. People, especially older Americans and those with loved ones in nursing homes, I get calls all the time. They’re simply scared. They’re frightened. This isn’t just taking a toll on the physical health. It’s an emotional cost as well. We can’t expect vulnerable populations to quarantine indefinitely without support. I want them to know that their health and safety will be my responsibility, if I’m your president. And I will not abandon you. These are five fairly straightforward steps that are going to help defeat this pandemic. And, if you suspect that a lot of these steps are the same sorts of things I was talking about in March when I released my first COVID-19 response, you’d be right. If it feels like you’re hearing the experts talk about the same issues for months, you’d be right. These have always been the steps that government needed to put in place to meet the threat. Statewide lockdowns that so many Americans lived under for months were intended to buy us time to get our act together. Instead of using that time to prepare ourselves, Donald Trump squandered it. Now, here we are, more than three months later. We’re hardly better prepared than we were in March. Infections are on the rise. The threat of massive spikes that overwhelm the capacity of our healthcare system is on the horizon. Americans, anxious and out of work, are fearful for their lives and their livelihoods. Donald Trump is doing next to nothing about it. Mr. President, the crisis is real. The crisis is real and it’s surging, Mr. President. Your promises, and predictions, and wishful thinking pulled out of thin air are not only doing the country no good, you’re making them lose even more faith in their government. America knows this crisis isn’t behind us, even if you don’t. They see what’s happening, even if you refuse to, Mr. President. They know we need a coordinated national plan, we need it now, even though you don’t, Mr. President, and won’t do it. You called yourself a cheerleader. We don’t need a cheerleader, Mr. President. We need a president, Mr. President. A president who will level with the American people, a president who will tell us the unvarnished truth, a president who will take responsibility instead of always blaming others, a president who will listen to the experts, follow the science, allow them to speak, a president who will lead and be an example for the nation. Wear a mask. Keep your distance. Limit the size of crowds. Mr. President, this is not about you. It’s about the health and wellbeing of the American public. American people don’t make enormous sacrifices over the past four months so they could just waste their time and you could waste all the efforts they have undertaken with your midnight rantings and tweets. They don’t make these sacrifices so you could ignore the science and turn responsible steps, like wearing masks, into a political statement. And they certainly didn’t do it, Mr. President, so you could wash your hands and walk away from this responsibility. Maybe there are times this nation needs a cheerleader. Now is not one of them. America needs a president. Whatever Trump does or does not do, we can’t know today what the state of the COVID-19 pandemic will be next January. But I’m almost certain, I hope I turn out to be wrong, I’m almost certain it won’t be over. If I should have the honor of being elected president, on the day I’m sworn in, I’ll get right to work implementing all aspects of the response that remain undone. I’ll have more to say about my day one COVID-19 agenda in the weeks to come. But my response will begin well before I take the oath of office. It will start as soon as the election is decided. I’ll be a president who respects scientists, who won’t censor their ability to speak directly to the American people. I will immediately reach out to Dr. Anthony Fauci to ask him to continue his incredible service to the country. And I’ll have, from day one, ready to go the best medical experts and scientists to advise on our response. Maybe most importantly, I will listen to them and let them speak freely. And I’ll work with the governors and mayors of both parties from every state, territory, and tribe. It’s a simple proposition folks. We’re all in this together. We got to fight this together. We’ll emerge from this stronger because we did it together. And I’m confident we can. May God bless you all and may God protect our troops. And I’m happy to take questions, if you have them. They gave me a list of how to recognize. [inaudible 00:20:48]. We’ll work with that. All right. So, we reported yesterday that President Trump was briefed as early as March of 2019 that Russia had ordered or offered bounties to the Taliban for the killing of U.S. soldiers. You called his inaction on this issue a betrayal. Well, look, first of all, Congress and the intelligence committees on the Congress, both parties should demand the facts. This seems to be a moving story. As I was leaving, I had the television on as I put on my shirt. And I understand there’s even some more information that’s come out today about what was known. One of two things, this president talks about cognitive capability. He doesn’t seem to be cognitively aware of what’s going on. He either reads and/or gets briefed on important issues and he forgets it, or he doesn’t think it’s necessary that he need to know it. But the fact is that, at a minimum, at a minimum, the discrepancy allegedly within the intelligence community as reported, some thought it was more certain and others thought it was less certain. That should be resolved. The president should have, on day one, said, I want you to come before me in the situation room and lay out the differences and discretions. Who is saying what? Let’s get to the bottom of it, number one. Number two, it’s clear to me that, and I don’t know whether he did, he should have immediately contacted our joint chiefs of staff, gotten them all in one room and sat and said, okay. Thirdly, he should, at a minimum, have picked up the phone and said, Vladimir, old buddy, if any of this is true and it doesn’t cease immediately, you’ve got a big problem, a big problem. And make it clear. Get to the bottom of this. It appears as though, from what I have… and I don’t have access to classified information anymore. But, if what I have heard over the last week and the recent reporting that it was in the PDB, the presidential daily brief. The presidential daily brief is something I read every single day as vice president. The president read it every day. I was briefed every morning before I got to the White House, and then again. So, the idea that somehow he didn’t know or isn’t being briefed, it is a dereliction of duty, if that’s the case. And, if he was briefed and nothing was done about this, that’s a dereliction of duty. I guess the best way for me to end this is, I was talking to Jill, my wife, Jill. And I don’t see her get outraged very often. But she started asking. She said, Joe, what would you have done if Beau was still in harm’s way? And this information came out? And the president, Beau is my son who was… I’m sorry, I apologize, who served in Iraq for a year, was in the army. But, if he’d been in Afghanistan, what would you do, Joe? What are those parents thinking out there? What are those sons and daughters, husbands and wives? It’s an absolute dereliction of duty if any of this is even remotely true. So, I think the president has a lot to answer for and we should get the answers quickly, quickly. If these allegations are true and he did nothing about any of this, then in fact, I think the public should, unrelated to my running, conclude that this man isn’t fit to be president of the United States of America. I was told, NBC, Mike. Mike’s great relief, he doesn’t have to follow me every day around the country. Well, the last time, Mr. Vice President, a lot of us saw you on the campaign trail, you were still locked in a very difficult nomination battle. The polls though today show you with a sizeable national lead, a lead in a lot of the states that are critical in the electoral college. Well, this is the most unusual campaign, I think, in modern history. But I start off with the premise, Mike, that I’m going to follow the doc’s orders. Off of the premise, Mike, that I’m going to follow the doc’s orders, not just for me, but for the country, and that means that I am not going to be holding rallies. I am not going to be … For example, you all are here, but I think the school has put those circles around, so we keep the social distancing. Everybody has masks on. As soon as I finish this, I’ll put my mask back on. And so it’s all been, almost all been virtual, although I have gone to Houston, I have gone into Pennsylvania, I have gone to Virginia. I have traveled, but when I do, I get in, make my case, and leave, take questions, and leave. But you know me. I’d much rather be out there with people because that’s where I get the greatest feel. I can get a sense of what, by the look in their eyes, by the plaintive voices that they have, and what they’re concerned about. But notwithstanding that, I have been surprised. The irony is we probably reach more people directly on one-on-one. You all, particularly those of you who are with television stations, you all know that when you’re on, you’re having a one-to-one conversation with someone out there because there’s one person at the TV looking at you. I never quite thought of it that way before. But they tell me 200 million people have watched what I have done from home, in the half a dozen things we’ve gone out and done. And so the irony is, I think we’re probably communicating directly in detail with more people than we would have otherwise. But I’d much rather be doing it in person. So far, it remains to be seen, I don’t want to jinx myself. I know the polling data is very good, but I think it’s really early. It’s much too early to make any judgment. I think we’ve got a whole lot more work to do. I’ve planned on laying out in detail my economic plan as to how we recover from this, plan on dealing with foreign … Working out in detail, what I’m going to do if I am elected president so the people know what’s coming. Quick follow-up to Alex’s question first. They have not offered a classified briefing. And as this proceeds, I may very well do that. I’ve been talking to … I have a significant foreign policy staff, as you know, that, matter of fact, dozens of them. So I had a long meeting with my former national security advisors, former secretaries of state, et cetera, and got in their read, what they’ve heard so far. But if it doesn’t get cleared up quickly, then I will seek and ask if I can be briefed. I can hardly wait. Thank you. Over the weekend, Princeton decided to remove Woodrow Wilson’s name from their school and buildings due to his racist thinking. President Trump yesterday called that decision “incredible stupidity. Well, I think there are sort of three categories on that. One, any institution that chose a name and wants to now jettison that name, that’s a decision for them to make, for whatever reason they make it. So I’m assuming the board of trustees at Princeton University made the judgment about the Woodrow Wilson School. I don’t know. But it was made within the context of an institution that chose that name and now no longer wants to be associated with that name. And I think the president is …. Well, secondly, I think there’s a distinction between, as the former mayor of New Orleans said, “The difference between reminders and remembrances of history and recovering from history.” And so the idea of comparing whether or not George Washington owned slaves or Thomas Jefferson owned slaves and somebody who was in rebellion committing treason, running, trying to take down the union to keep slavery, I think there’s a distinction there. And so I think the idea of bringing down, I think all those Confederate monuments to Confederate soldiers and generals, et cetera, who strongly supported secession and the maintenance of slavery and going to war to do it, I think those statues belong in museums. They don’t belong in public places. And I think with regard to those statues that are in monuments like the Jefferson Memorial or whatever, I think there’s an obligation that the government protect those monuments because they’re different than that’s a remembrance. It is not a dealing with, revering somebody who had that view. They had much broader views. They may have things in their past that are now and then distasteful, but that’s a judgment for the … For example, taking down, toppling Christopher Columbus statue, George Washington’s statue, or et cetera, I think that is something that is, the government has an opportunity and a responsibility to protect from happening. And on a different subject, you have been doing these public events for the past month, which has put you in contact with more people. No, I have not been protected. I have not been tested for the coronavirus for two reasons. One, I have had no symptoms. As my mother would say, knock on wood. And number two, I haven’t wanted to take anybody else’s place in the process. But the Secret Service, they all get tested. They’re around my home. And anyone who comes into my home, including staff, is tested, just to determine whether they have the virus. I expect what I’m going to do so it doesn’t look like I’m moving in the front of the line here is be tested relatively soon. My daughter has been tested. She was in Florida. She’s a social worker working with the Boys and Girls Club. She came home, and before she could come home, she’s been tested twice, so to make sure she’s clear and quarantined … She lives in Philadelphia. But I haven’t yet. I have not been tested yet. Yes. I’m sorry. Who was I supposed to go to next? Anybody? I got to make sure I get the Wilmington newspaper here before I leave or I’ll be dead. Thank you, Mr. Vice President. It’s good to see you, and I know we all hope that you continue to do this through November as often as possible. We will. The more I have an opportunity, I will do it. Two quick questions. One to follow up on Russia. You talked about what our president has done, but yesterday you said at a fundraiser regarding Vladimir Putin, quote, I’ll confront Putin. I’ll strengthen NATO. I’ll make clear to Putin that he’ll have a price to pay for interference in our democratic processes. Specifically, can you tell us what you would do to Putin? If this is true, and in general, for what’s happened in the past. I can, but I will not … But I will tell him. Here’s the deal. The idea that Putin or any other foreign leader can engage in attempting to manipulate the presidential election, the idea that he continues his activities in Central and Eastern Europe, that he’s doing, the idea that it can be done without any consequences is not going to happen if I’m president in my administration. That ranges from everything to making sure we go to the United Nations Security Council, all the way to imposing sanctions that would be commensurate with the action that he has taken that is inappropriate. But I have had some very blunt, straightforward conversations with President Putin when I was vice president and before that, and I think one of the reasons why it appears as though he doesn’t want me to be president, he knows we’ll have more blunt conversations. And another issue that’s been in the news last week, this week, probably next week, the Supreme Court. President says he’s going to issue an updated list of potential nominees to the court. You have said you would put a black woman on the court, should a spot open up. But there are groups calling for you to release a list of specific names you’d put on the court. One thing I hesitate to do is follow anything the president does at all, because he usually does it all wrong. We are putting together a list of a group of African American women who are qualified and have the experience to be in the court. I am not going to release that until we go further down the line of vetting them as well. And just like logical questions about vice president, I’m not releasing the names of all the vice presidential potential nominees. There are a number of women of color. There are Latina women. There are Asian. There are across the board, and we’re just underway now in the hard vet of going into the deep background checks that take anywhere from six to eight weeks to be done. The committees have been formed, and that’s underway. Well, early August. I can’t guarantee you August 1, but it will be in early August before, several weeks before the convention, I believe. Yes. Thank you, Mr. Vice president. This is a two-parter, just to follow up again on Russia. Do you believe that if those reports are true that Trump is guilty of violating his oath of office? And on your VP choice, you’ve said that you want your running mate to be ready on day one to do the job. Yes. And that depends. Look, one of the things you try to do, I’ve talked at length over the years with President Obama about this. You try to find people who have a background and an expertise that you may not have. And so one of the reasons President Obama picked me is because I had considerable experience in getting things done in the Congress. And secondly, I had considerable experience in foreign policy and national security. And although he had clear views of what in fact he wanted to do and what his standard what his strategy was in terms of America’s role in the world, he was looking for someone that had day-to-day experience and knew a lot of those world leaders. And so I think that, although that’s a helpful thing to have, it’s not necessary because I start off with the two places I still have some expertise are in both those places, in uniting the country and the Congress and foreign policy. And so it is almost all of the women I’m considering have had some exposure to foreign policy and national defense issues and security issues. But that is not a minimum requirement. Requirement is that they have the intellectual capacity, as well as the temperament, as well as the leadership qualities that lend to everyone to believe that they would be ready on day one to be President of the United States of America. And what he knew, but at a minimum, at a minimum, either doesn’t understand his job and is having difficulty sitting down and being able to read a report because a lot of those reports come across that he says, “I didn’t read it,” or. “I didn’t see it,” or, “I didn’t know it.” I don’t know how he could not read and not see and not know so many different things that have come up over the last three years. But it is clearly a dereliction of duty and it is clearly something that I think everyone, including my Republican friends and my Republican opponents in the House and Senate are worried about as well. Thank you. All right. Last question. All right. Where’s the Delaware State News? I mean Delaware News Channel I should say. That’s my hometown team. I better call on them. How are you Mr. So like other States, Delaware, your home state, is seeing an increase in coronavirus cases. Well, I think they’ve handled it pretty well so far, but now I think you’re seeing the governor make some adjustments because there has been an uptick, not tremendous, but there’s been an uptick. It was one of the states that was, I get briefed up every day by a group of leading docs around the world, around the country, Vic Murphy and Dr. Ben. Anyway. And so every day I get a printout, I have it in the book here, of the states that are doing better and doing worse. Up to now, there has been a decline and now it’s opening up slightly. I have not spoken to the governor today, but my guess is, I’d only guess, is that he’s going to be looking very closely what happens on the Delaware beaches now, how that has occurred and restaurants and bars. I don’t know enough to know that though. The good news is that it’s flattened out. The bad news is there’s a slight uptick and I have not gone into the detail of the governor. I speak to him not infrequently, but a couple of times a month, three, four times a month. And so I don’t have any advice for him yet because I don’t know where it’s popping up. Thank you. Thank you. [inaudible 00:41:33]. I’m going to get in trouble. Fire away. I know. Tell them I’ll be late. Just a little bit. Thank you, Mr. Vice President. I always get in trouble on the last question, but go ahead. We appreciate it. The response to this pandemic has become very politicized. Even wearing a mask has become political. Well, I think the way to get on the same page is to… I’m going to try to say this politely, is to lower the rhetoric based on division. Stop appealing to the less healthy side of society. Instead of, for example, when a golf cart goes by yelling, “White supremacy,” and the president tweets it out, don’t do things like that. Bring the country together. We’re giving a portion of the population who has responded to the sort of race baiting the president has engaged in a sort of free pass and it generates divisions. And we’re also talking about it in terms of the president talks about manhood and being strong and you don’t need the mask. I think we have to start appealing to the better side of human nature by pointing out that that mask is not so much to protect me. It’s if I have it, it’s to protect you against me. It’s to protect other people. And it’s called patriotism. It’s called responsibility. It’s called making sure you look out for the other person. And we have spent too much time, if you notice, the president puts everything in terms of him. And I’m not being facetious, everything is him. It’s I don’t think, or I don’t take responsibility or I didn’t do that, or I believe that. I mean, it’s not about I. It’s about us. And I think changing the tone of an administration across the board, allowing scientists to speak, making sure that people understand the facts, good, bad, and indifferent. And when a mistake is made to say, “I made a mistake, I was wrong. Shouldn’t have done it that way. We should do it this way.” I think all those things change the atmosphere. Let me conclude it by saying this, and I apologize, you’ve heard me say this before. The words of a president matter. No matter who the president is, no matter how responsible or irresponsible the president is. A president, whomever he or she is, can take us to war or bring peace, can have markets rise or fall, appeal to the senior side of humanity or to our better angels. It matters. It really matters. And so I think it’s about the tone. And I think it goes across the board. I’ll conclude with this. I know that I was criticized, legitimately criticized, during the primaries, by saying that I plan on uniting the country, bringing Democrats and Republicans together. We have to do that. If we can’t do that, we can’t function. We have to bring the country together. And I think on this piece, if in fact we stand up, and by the way, don’t hold me to the numbers, please, you can correct me on this, but I think something like 70 or 74 or 75% of the American people think you should wear a mask. The overwhelming number of people think you should take these precautions and so on, think we should open more slowly. Well, I think that we should be talking to our better angels and actually making people indirectly feel guilty for not doing the right thing, appeal to their better nature. I know that sounds almost idealistic, but it’s not. Remind people. You don’t wear this mask, you end up hurting someone or you get infected, you take it home to your child. You can take it home to your mother and your father and your husband, your wife. You have a moral obligation because it really is. It really is. Thank you. Guys, I really do have to go. I apologize. I’m going to get in real trouble. I’m probably already in trouble, but thank you. Go ahead. What’s the last? I’m sorry. Good to see you out and about Mr. Vice President. I’m a little confused about the delineation, about the destruction of monuments. You talk about the fathers of this country, Washington, Jefferson, is worthy of preservation. Well, I think it’s very different. I think it’s better if they’re taken down like they took the Confederate flag off the Mississippi flag. That’s the better way of doing it, but I can understand. I can understand the anger and anguish that people feel by having for years and years been under the statue of Robert E. Lee, if you’re an African American. So it’s a difference. It’s always better to do it peacefully, but there’s a distinction between. I shift responsibility and I think the elected officials where those statues are have a responsibility to move. Put them in museums, get them down. But don’t expect if you have sitting in front of you after all these years and we finally, finally are going through another phase of maybe responding to the systemic racism in America, and what we’ve seen happen, is don’t be surprised if someone pulls down the statue of Jefferson Davis. It’s better that they do not, but is fundamentally different than pulling down the statue or going to the Lincoln Memorial and trying to pull a… Not Lincoln Memorial. That’s a bad example. The Jefferson Memorial and grabbing Jefferson off his chair. Two quickies. Oh yes. Three. Yeah. I commit to it. Look, I am committed to following the debate, the National Debate Group that sets up these debates, who they pick as the moderators, three of them. It’s been this way for a long time. The first one is a one-on-one debate with a moderator. The next one is led by a town meeting set and a third one is a normal debate again. I commit to those, I’m looking forward to them. Last question real quick. That you are subject to some degree of cognitive decline. I’m 65. I don’t have word recollection that I used to have. I forget my train of thought from time to time. You’ve got 12 years on me, sir. I’ve been testing. I’m constantly testing. Look, all you got to do is watch me and I can hardly wait to compare my cognitive capability to the cognitive capability of the man I’m running against. Thank you so much. Thank you, guys."
"84","07-02-20"," Good morning. Today we learned the latest job numbers. Like every American I’m happy that millions of American workers are back on payrolls and this historic unemployment we still face has at least come down a bit more. This is a good day for every one of those individuals and their families who regained their security. But as happy as I was for millions of workers returning to their jobs, there is one number that I was stunned that the president didn’t mention even once in the process and the entire time he talked about it, the number was 50,000. Yesterday the number of new COVID-19 cases in America topped 50,000 in a single day. We’ve never hit that number before in the course of this virus. In 45 states, the seven day average of infections are higher than they were a week ago. In some places, hospital ICUs are at the near capacity, near breaking point. And we’re still seeing all across the country spikes in the virus that are causing many states to impose new restrictions again. To me and to many Americans this is very worrisome turn in the path and severity of the virus and the president didn’t even address it. Yesterday he reiterated his belief that the virus was going to disappear. Today he described what was happening as fires, quote, fires flaring up in the country. That’s just not an honest assessment of what’s happening. And it’s not just me saying that, the rest of the world knows that as well. Just this week, 27 European countries have banned Americans from traveling there because of the surging number of COVID-19 cases in the United States. The European Union says, “Don’t come.” They’re coming from a dangerous place for the virus. Until this president faces what’s going on in our country, our economy is going to remain at risk. Today’s report is positive news, and I’m thankful for it, for real, but make no mistake we’re still on a deep, deep job hole because Donald Trump has so badly bungled the response to coronavirus and now has basically given up on responding at all. You know a million more Americans would, millions of them would still have their job if Donald Trump had done his job and many of the jobs that have now come back should never have been lost in the first place. And for everyone whose job hasn’t come back, for everyone who doesn’t own stock, who can’t get the sweetheart loan through connections, does this feel like a victory? For parents are worried their kids can’t go back to school in the fall, do you feel like this is mission accomplished? Or for the people in states where COVID-19 is spiking and we’re seeing record high numbers of infections, do you feel like this crisis is under control? Of course not. People are scared. They’re worried about their families and about their future, but just like last month, President Trump has spiked the ball and made this about him. He doesn’t seem to realize he’s not even on the 50 yard line. Only one third of the jobs that were lost in March and April have now come back. Most of those jobs that returned were people on temporary furlough. That means these were the easiest jobs to get back as we reopen cities and states. It’s only going to get harder from here though. Permanent job lost numbers actually went up 588,000, almost 3 million permanently lost jobs. President Trump touted the job gains for African American workers, but unemployment for black men actually rose from 15.5% to 16.3% in June. He touted the numbers for Latino unemployment, but those numbers are still more than three times higher than they were before the crisis started. Look, let’s not lose sight of the critical point. This report measures job gains as of June the 12th, in the days since we’ve seen cases spiking around the country, some businesses closed down again, some states reimposing restrictions. And in the last two weeks, we’ve seen almost 3 million new unemployment filings and another 1.7 million people seeking pandemic unemployment insurance. There’s no victory to be celebrated. We should hope, but there’s no victory celebrate it. We’re still down nearly 15 million jobs and the pandemic is getting worse, not better. And it doesn’t have to. Millions of Americans are still out of work wondering when or if their job will come back or worried about how to pay the bills in the meantime. Trump wants to declare his health crisis over and unemployment solved. Unfortunately, he’s deadly wrong on both fronts. We’ve already at more than 128,000 dead. The number keeps climbing. That’s a direct consequence of Donald Trump’s bungled leadership and a total mismanagement of this crisis from the start. His failure to take quick action made this pandemic more costly for American people in every way, in lives lost, in economic impact and economic toll of those living with so much doubt and uncertainty. Now, as I said on Tuesday, he surrendered to this virus. Other countries have figured out how to get the virus under control and reopened their economies and put their people safely back to work. Other leaders didn’t waste time they were given from the start for stay at home orders. They got to work solving the root causes of this crisis, the coronavirus. Donald Trump just had given up. He’s not even trying to secure the public health anymore. He’d rather go back to the campaign rallies. He’s not interested in uniting us in this fight of a common threat we face. He’s decided he’s more, has more to gain by dividing this country for his own political purposes. Without a uniform plan and guidance from the federal government that state and local leaders can use to inform their reopening plans this is going to continue to be worse than it would have been otherwise. Recovery will be slower. Unemployment will stay higher than it should be. Has he even once expressed any real empathy for the families who’ve never again be whole because of this virus? Has he done anything, anything real to prioritize support for working Americans who need help now? Now. Democrats in Congress have put forward legislation to reward and protect our brave frontline workers. Helping working families find childcare, extend the supplemental unemployment benefits for people for the duration of the economic crisis. Meanwhile, the Republicans and President Trump are stalling on support for working families, even as they dole out taxpayer money to big corporations with zero accountability. Has Donald Trump even acknowledged the disproportionate impact this disease is having on black, brown and Native American communities, much less done anything to address those health disparities or underlying systemic racism has shapes them? You know the answer. Of course not. That’d require him to step up and lead. It would require him to put the American people ahead of his own interest. Didn’t have to be like this. America has more reported deaths and infections than anywhere else in the world. Our healthcare workers were still rationing personal protective equipment. They still don’t have sufficient testing to allow people to return to work with confidence. President Trump has turned wearing a mask into a political statement. And yesterday, yesterday he was once more claiming the coronavirus would quote, just disappear, I hope. Quote, just disappear I hope. That’s what he said. It’s like deja vu all over again. We’re months into this crisis and that’s still his best answer. Quit hoping for the best Mr. President. Quit claiming victory with almost 15 million un-Americans still out of work because of the crisis. Quit ignoring the reality this pandemic and the horrifying loss of American life. Act. Lead. Lead. Or get out of the way so others can Mr. President. God bless you all and may He protect you and may God protect our troops. Thank you."

They’re the kite strings that lift our national ambitions aloft. And you have them in your hands. And your members are lucky to have you. And I’m absolutely certain of that because I happened to be, as I said, married to one of your members. Jill and I are truly honored to have your support. And I mean, that from bottom of my heart. I can’t wait for the departure of Donald Trump and the chance to replace Betsy DeVos and the opportunity for us to make a whole lot of progress together. Because I’m confident, I’m absolutely confident we can. And I want to assure you tonight, this is going to be a teacher oriented department of education, and it’s not going to come from the top down. It’s coming from the teachers up. I know that there are a number of issues on everybody’s mind, but an immediate challenge is the continued spread of the coronavirus and what it means in the upcoming school year. Look, we saw this challenge coming. I’ve calling for the president to address this for months, since late January. Donald Trump failed to take any action on testing, contact tracing, creating responsible standards, everything we needed to do to get the pandemic under control and to get educators and students back in the classroom. And you understood what was needed. Frankly, we’ve always understood. Back in 2009, when I was overseeing the implementation of a recovery act in the face of the worst financial crisis in American history short of the depression, we knew we had to stand up for educators. It was almost a $84 billion program that had to get out there within the matter of 16, I guess, probably 18 months and it had less waste and fraud than any program of that size ever, less than two tenths of 1%. But here’s what it did. It allocated $60 billion to local school districts. $60 billion which saved 400,000 education jobs. We knew it had to be done in the face of the crisis. And the federal government also understood that every state requires to balance their budget. Localities have to balance their budget. There’s a reason why the federal government couldn’t be able to deal with crises like this. But this time around, when the pandemic struck, Trump tried to provide support failed when he said we got to support educators. Trump to failed to do it. Trump and local government, the state and local governments are facing huge shortfalls. Speaker Pelosi, a real leader, and the house of representatives, did their job. They passed a thing called the HEROES Act, $950 billion for state and local governments. Trump and the Senate Republican refused to do the job. This isn’t a math exercise. This is about people. So I’m making sure educators salary don’t get cut and educators don’t get fired. And we could have kept every educator employed, but instead, we lost more than 900, 000 state and local education jobs since the pandemic started due to budget cutting. This is absolutely unacceptable. We’re already short the number of teachers we need nationally, before this crisis hit. Last month, I put out a plan to reopen safely and sustainably, including for our public schools. I require steps like one, ensuring that schools have funding for physical alterations, like plexiglass to maximize social distancing, all of the things that every scientist has told us we need to do. And we need the federal government to give schools and states and local governments clear guidance. Finally, we need to prevent any further exacerbating inequities in our education system by ensuring that every student, every American student has access to broadband and other technology, so they can participate in remote learning. There’s probably a higher probability that we’ll need to continue to rely on more remote learning in parts in the country for a while longer. And we’ve seen, and all of you know, the gap in students’ access to technology can cost kids up to a full year or more of learning. We need to get this done now. We’ve been arguing it for a while. It’s only just a start now. Because once we get ahead of this pandemic, we’re going to have an unprecedented opportunity to make progress and we need to ensure that you and your students get treated with dignity that you deserve. My education plan starts with tripling the funding for a Title I school. One of the first things that districts must do with their funding is ensure hire… in order to get this money they have to ensure higher salaries for educators. That funding will also eliminate the $23 billion annual gap between majority white and non white districts. It’s one of the single best instruments and investments that we can make to address systemic inequality. In addition to getting the raises you deserve, we’re going to get you the resources you need. We’re going to double the number of school psychologists and counselors and nurses and social workers at school. Mental health is an enormous issue and the need has only been exacerbated by this pandemic on both educators as well as students. There’s a whole lot more in my plan. We’re going to fix universal pre-K for all three and [inaudible 00:23:56] years old. We’re going to find it for everybody. Help educators wipe out the burden of their own student debt. But there is a bottom line here. When we win this election, we’re going to get the support you need and the respect you deserve. You don’t just have a partner in the White House, you’ll have an NEA member in the White House. And if I’m not listening, I’m going to be sleeping alone in the Lincoln bedroom. We’re absolutely totally committed to make so much more progress [inaudible 00:08:27]. There’s so much to talk about. I know you have questions. I wish I could talk longer about how passionate I feel about some of these things. But [inaudible 00:24:36] as my mother would say, hush up and I’d be happy to take some of your questions. Well, we really appreciate you being here. It’s an honor to have you here, Vice President Biden. You betcha. You’re the best. Yeah, you really are. People don’t get me. You really are. Thank you so much. yeah, I know. I know. I wasn’t arguing with you. Okay. You know that you have received our support in the primary, that is almost over. And that part of our process now is for you to make your case to the 8,000, almost 8,000 delegates, that are watching you right now. And one of the things that you asked is to listen to some of the questions from our members who asked them. I really appreciate you wanting that. I could sit here and I could read them to you, but we took you up on that. We found some delegates who had asked some of the most frequently asked questions that came to us. We said, go up. And so we’re going to do that because we had NEA members throughout the country who had the opportunity to submit those questions online and of the thousands, these are the delegates that were selected. So let’s go now to Turquoise Parker in Durham, North Carolina. Turquoise is a K-5 media specialist. Turquoise, you may now ask your question to Vice President Biden, Turquoise. Hello President Lilly and Vice President Biden. My name is Turquoise LeJeune Parker. My Durham public schools title is media coordinator. My self given title is racial and social justice teacher. And this coming school year will be my 10th year teaching. Vice President Biden, Black Lives Matter period. And we should have had the folks who killed Breonna Taylor arrested and charged long ago. But the Eurocentric curriculum that we are expected to teach affirms and furthers the aforementioned. I call my students Mrs. Parker’s professors, not students because I believe in their intelligence and their strength and their beauty and I need them to believe in themselves because our world does not make them feel that way. Abolitionist teaching is our duty. It’s my duty to structure a curriculum that talks through all kinds of complex issues, such as police brutality, how to fight it while staying safe, how to organize and how they can come to terms with the possibility that they might be the next victim of white supremacy at absolutely no fault of their own. Teaching in the resistance is incredibly hard work, but we have to do it because we need our kids to know that they are absolutely a part of this movement to smash white supremacy. So Vice President Biden, here’s my question for you. What I’ve been doing my whole career. That’s how I got involved. Look, this has to be a wake up call for the country and to take action. It’s past time to [inaudible 00:28:03] of racism and our growing economic inequities. We just need to do it. But [inaudible 00:28:09] nations promised with so many people. It starts off, as you know better than I do, because I spent a lot of time working with young people, but I never taught young people. The first thing is to treat them with respect, treat them with dignity, tell them about holding their heads high, reminding them that everybody gets knocked out, but you got to get up, reminding them that they can do anything at all, anything at all, if they set their mind to it. And that you and I and others are fighting for them. I’m going to fight every day for the changes that I’ve referenced. But I’m also going to listen. I laid out the initial [inaudible 00:28:52] leadership I think I need to take on a real police reform, hold all cops to higher standards that so many don’t now. One of the things you find [inaudible 00:29:05] young students you may have in that circumstance, but you find they have a mom or dad unfairly, or maybe even fairly, but incarcerated. And when they get out of school, what happens? When they get out of prison, what happens? They’re treated as if they’re still in prison. We have to revive, we have to treat the criminal justice system like rehabilitation. Not like it is punishment. No one should go to jail, for example, for the use of a drug. They should go to medic or rehab. No more prisons be built. Build rehab facilities. We have to invest in our criminal justice, focus on ending cash bail, converting drug offenders to rehabilitating, investing much more in their reentry. What we need to do more than just reform the police department if it’s going to address the inequities in our society. We have to root out systemic racism in our economy, our education, and our healthcare. And I’m going to fight to end the deadly health inequities that exist in COVID-19 amplified by worry, expanding Obamacare. So they don’t see your parents family that you got I can’t go for a test because we can’t afford it, or I’m really feeling sick, but I’m afraid if I go I’m go it’s going to [inaudible 00:30:17]. The fastest path to universal care is to expand Obamacare, which I won’t go into now, but I have a detailed way to do it and get it done. I’m going to double the funding for community health centers. On the violent front lines, make all coronavirus testing and treatment and vaccine for anyone free. And if I could give every child [inaudible 00:00:30:38]. I really want to know, because at all the great university over the last 10 years, we’ve come up with some really startling new insights. You had about 40% of a child’s brain is developed by the time they’re three, up to 60%. Providing universal pre-K for three to four years old increasing over 58%, the chance of them doing well all the way through school. Tripling Title I funding to close that gap between the rich and the poor, making public college free for every family earning less than $125,000 a year. I propose making sure we get $75 billion to HBCUs, which I’ve been deeply involved with my whole career, because they don’t have the kind of backup funding to provide for the laboratories and all the other things that are needed to compete for government contracts. That will do everything for all industry in the future. We’re going to lead a just and national recovery providing stimulus funding for small businesses. You all know better than I do, but I know pretty darn well, that community, particularly a poor community, Latino or black community, thrives or doesn’t thrive whether or not they have amidst around them small businesses. The local drug store, the local supermarket. But what’s happening now is under this unfair recovery that Trump is running, they’re not doing what they have wanted to do. Provide small business money for those with 10 or fewer businesses, so that they can stay open. They’re not getting the loans. They should be getting them and rebuilding strong, inclusive communities. And that generates growth, that generates self awareness, it generates community. These are big things. But if ever there was a time for big change, it’s now. We have to make this at least an era of action to reverse systemic racism, is long overdue with concrete change but it’s coming. We can do it because once things happen we reach, and I guess I’m sounding like a history professor, or the law professor that I was for a while. And that is that there are inflection points in American history, or something happens and big changes occur. What’s happened now with this COVID virus, and so many people affected by it, and so many people unnecessarily died because of it, all of a sudden people are realizing, oh my God, who’s been carrying us on their back? Essential worker. Who are the essential workers? Overwhelmingly people of color, black, Latino, Asian American. And they’re getting paid five, six, seven bucks an hour. Those are the ones that are making sure that shelf is stocked in the grocery store, and I’m able to come by and pick up my groceries, outside. They’re the ones that are not able to stay home because they have no choice. They be carrying us on their back. I think the public is ready. It’s like they had their blinders taken off like, oh my God, this really happens? It’s really this way. I spent time with the Floyd family at George Floyd’s funeral. I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe. Mama. Mama. What happened was the whole world saw it. They just didn’t hear it. They saw it. They saw it. They saw his face smashed up against that curb. They saw him hold him there for a total of eight minutes and 46 seconds. They saw it. They said, “Oh my God.” We’re going to change this. We’re going to change it in a big way. Last thing I’ll say. As a kid, I used to stutter a lot. I’m not making it comparable to someone who is a young African American who has not been treated well, or has been a victim of systemic racism. But I tell you one thing don’t do. Don’t ever talk down on these kids. And they tell me, I talk to them, they finish my sentence for me. I’m smart, don’t finish my sentence. These kids are capable of doing anything anybody else can do. Let’s not dumb it down. They’re incredibly capable. That’s fine. With title one funding money, I want to make sure that in those schools, they have these placement courses as well. My mother used to having an expression, children tend to turn out to be what you expect of them. Let’s show them the love and respect, and then the support. You’ve got to give their parents more economic power. [inaudible 00:35:53] a lot more of centrist pride. I’m emotional about it. We can do this. We are at one of those inflection points. Thank you for what you do. Thank you Turquoise for that important question. We got that question from a lot of delegates and thank you for representing the importance of lifting that up. And thank you, Vice President Biden. Our next question comes from one of our education support professionals in Michigan. Vice President Biden, you know that we are teachers, we are support professionals, we are college staff and faculty. And so this is one of what we call ESPs, Education Support Professionals. She has firsthand experience dealing with our very unqualified Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos. I would like to introduce you to Paula McConnell, who is a paraprofessional in the Utica school district. Paula, you now have the ear of the Vice President. Thank you, president Lilly. Good afternoon, Vice President Biden. Good afternoon. My name is Paula McConnell. I am from McComb County in the great lake state of Michigan. I have been a para-educator for over 30 years in Utica community schools. In the midst of this pandemic, as educators, have some concerns. We have President Trump disregarding the advice of health experts and pushing for the immediate opening of schools. And then highly unqualified Betsy DeVos either has nothing to say or is giving already scarce public school dollars to private education, which puts the jobs of dedicated educators everywhere at risk. To paraphrase Franklin Delano Roosevelt, in the great depression. He said the American people can handle bad news, but you have to give it to them straight. That has never been more important than it is now. Americans haven’t been getting it straight from this president. They’ve made tremendous sacrifices over the past few months to buy this government time to get his act together to beat this virus. But Donald Trump squandered that sacrifice and it’s all about him. Think about it. He thinks the presidency is about him, and it doesn’t have a damn thing to do with him. It’s about you. It’s about the American people. First of all, it’d be nice to have a president who’d tell the truth occasionally. We’ll do the work, but who’s going to lead? We need a plan. I’ve outlined the key steps for beating this crisis and reopening safely, including by helping childcare and schools reopen. Parents have to be able to trust their kids are safe when they’re able to go back to work, when that occurs. It’s one of the most important steps to reopening the entire economy. Educators make tremendous sacrifices, some show much creativity. We’ve done the hard work to make the abrupt shift to online learning, with overwhelming difficulty. Demands that students don’t really have the equipment. Not the educators fault because they come from poor families. And because many places don’t have high speed broadband. But the longer schools are closed, the classes are remote, the more students, especially low income students and students of color, fall behind. I’d mobilize the federal government to take this place to step one. Provide for schools to reopen. Make sure states and districts have the funding to keep educators on the job in the midst of this crisis. Boost federal funding to cover the cost of the PPE, extra cleaning, new technologies, redesigned classrooms, all the things schools are going to need to do to be able to open and open with normality. Scale research in how COVID affects children to help understand how the virus affects children and create evidence based guidance. Build a safer school best practice clearing house. Tell school and school board that children and childcare providers all across the country and around the world to share information approaches and tools for reopening. I’m going to work with educators, childcare providers, unions, communities, and families on how to reopen safely. The bottom line is we are not 50 different nations in the United States, and territories beyond that territories. We are one nation, one nation, and we act and it can simply mess with your thought pattern. And the way the president tries to turn this all into some kind of racial contest about me. It’s immoral. We have to have a clear message based on science, based on what the experts tell us. And based on the circumstances that we allow. And make sure we get the input from the people who are in the field, in the classroom, in the buildings, dealing with the problem. But look, even when it gets to the point where we figured out how to test and trace, which doesn’t exist very much in the country. How about a president who says stop the testing, it’s showing too many people have it. Stop the testing? You’re doing too much of it? Sorry, I think he said slow it down. What in God’s, this is not about him and his reelection. This is about the safety and security of our people. And parents, including teachers, are not going to be able to go back to work until they’re sure their children from one oh, to three to four years old are able to be taken care of safely. And so there’s so much forgotten but we can do it. We can do it. The public is ready to pay for it, and it will increase productivity in this country, it will increase the learning, it will increase salaries, and increase the benefits to the whole country. Thank you so much. Thank you, Paula. And thank you, Vice President Biden. We have one more question for you. Our final educator comes from Enola, Pennsylvania, just outside of Harrisburg. I know it. Jimbo Lamb is… Yeah, we picked Pennsylvania just for you and not because our Vice President, Becky [Pringle 00:43:11] here, standing over here making noise. All right, settle down. Settle down. Settle down. Good grief. Yes. Becky Pringle, who you will, I know you know, Becky. But she is from Pennsylvania, lived in Harrisburg for a long, long time. Jimbo Lamb, apparently your good friend, I did not know that, is a high school math teacher. Jimbo, you are on with Vice President Biden. Thank you madam president, and hello and Vice President Biden. Hey Jimbo. My name is Jimbo lamb and I’ve been a high school math teacher in the Annville-Cleona school district in the Southern region of the Pennsylvania education association for 17 years. I appreciate you providing time for me to ask this question, and for listening to educators. Today, we’re more divided than we have been at any time in my lifetime, whether it is about racial justice, wearing masks, or simply left versus right. And educators, we teach our students to be respectful kind, and to work with others, but our leaders fail to model this behavior. So here’s my question. Well, Jimbo, you know that I’m a Pennsylvania guy from Scranton, married a Philly girl, and I was just out of Harrisburg actually. Anyway, look, you may remember when I started the campaign over a year ago and I announced. I said, one of the things you have to do is unite the country and I got clobbered by everyone running for president for the Democrats. They said, “You can’t unite the country.” Well, I’ll tell you what, if we don’t unite the country we’re in deep, deep, deep, deep trouble. This is the most important election in our lifetimes. Not because I’m running, because four more years of Donald Trump will fundamentally alter the character of this nation. And the character of our country is literally on the ballot. Lives and livelihoods as well. I think we’re facing a serious threat. We have to meet it as one country. This president gives us no direction. It pits us against one another. We can’t go on like this in the nation. Half recovering, half getting worse, half wearing masks, half denying science, half of a plan, half just hoping for the best. This country’s crying out for leadership, Jimbo. And for healing. I emphasized the healing. That’s part of a president’s job to lead, listen, and heal. And to listen to everyone. Even before today, our politicians have become too mean, too personal, and too early. It weakens us. It distracts us. It divides us. It’s not who we are. And I refuse to accept the idea that our nation is permanently divided. It is not. Principles must never be compromised, compromise is not a dirty word. It’s how our government was designed to work. I found that my whole life. And so I’ll do as president. Look, there’s two reasons why Jim, I decided to run this time. You know, if the perfect president, if he or she requires to have 10 great attributes. I’ve not met one that has more than six. But all the attributes you have may not be appropriate for that moment in history. There’s two things I’ve done fairly well at in my career. One, no one’s ever doubted my word. And I’ve been able to bring Democrats and Republicans together in the United States Congress for past big things, to deal with big issues. There’s a reason for that, Jimbo. I never questioned what was the man or woman’s motives. I questioned their judgment, but not their motives. When I first got elected in 1972, I wasn’t old enough to be sworn in as a senator, I was only 29 years old. So I had to wait. My birthday didn’t come until 17 days after the election. I was in Washington on December 18th, hiring staff. And I did it in December 18th, and I got a phone call. I got a phone call from a first responder who said, and I felt so badly for it in retrospect. He said “You’ve got to come home, there’s been an accident.” What happened? And the poor kid just blurted out, “Your wife’s dead. Your daughter’s dead. And your two boys not may not make it.” My wife, and my daughter was 18 months old. My son, almost three, the other one, almost four, were Christmas shopping. The tree was on top of the car. They were broadsided by a tractor trailer and they were killed. … by a tractor trailer and there were killed, the two boys made it. So what happened was I decided I didn’t want to be a United States senator. And my brother, Jim Bo, every kid would call him Jim Bo. His name is James, Jimmy Biden. Well, Jim Bo was the guy, he’s five and a half years younger than me, but he had raised all our money, raised as the kiddy’s campaign we had. And he went to the Democratic governor-elect to put someone in my place because the state could always get another senator, my kids couldn’t get another dad. And what happened was the group of really fine senators, one Republican, five Democrats, all came to see me and said, “You’ve got to run, and you’ve got to be sworn in. In retrospect, they saved my sanity. “Just stay for six months. Just stay for six months.” I’ll never forget, Senator Mansfield saying, “Only 1,702 people have ever been sworn into the Senate. Your wife nearly worked so hard to get you elected. You owe it to your family.” So I was supposed to go down to get sworn in, and the day I supposed to be sworn in I decided not to go. Well, the next day I was in the hospital with my son and they sent up the secretary of the Senate that swore me in the hospital. They tell me I’m the only guy sworn in in a hospital with my boys. So I went down, and one of the things I had to do was I had to meet with the majority leader at two o’clock or three, depending on the week on Tuesday afternoon. And I get an assignment from the leader, Mike Mansfield from Montana. I thought all senators got assignments. No senators get assignments. Matter of fact, I’m the first senator I ever knew. I didn’t know anything. It took me about five, six weeks to realize that he just was sort of taking my pulse, just seeing how I was emotionally. So I’d walk in to the Senate floor just before 2:00, walk down into the well of the Senate, seen the last Republican leave, walk out the other door to other side into the leader’s office and had my meeting because I commuted everyday to Wilmington, Delaware. So the next thing that happens is I walk in the door this particular day, the last week in May, and two friends of mine, one became a great friend, and still is, Bob Dole and the other was Teddy Kennedy. He was already a senator. They introduced the precursor to the Americans with Disabilities Act, and a particular senator that got elected [inaudible 00:02:35], who didn’t have much of a heart, I thought, was up on the floor, just saying, “They can’t confiscate my money or anybody else’s to have a curb cut. There’s no requirement that taxpayers should have to pay for lifts on the buses,” and all this stuff. I thought, “What a heartless son of a b.” But I had to walk in and have my meeting. I sat down across the desk from Senator Mansfield, and he always had a corncob pipe, but hardly ever light it. Said, “What’s the matter, Joe.” And I then went off the next few minutes excoriating this senator, saying he had no social redeeming value, he had no heart, et cetera, et cetera. He let me go on, then he stopped. He said, “Joe, what would you say if I told you that senator and his wife were sitting in their home in December, 1970 …” This is now May of ’73. “… 1970, and there was a young man in their statewide newspaper and a picture of him in braces under his arm all the way down to his ankles and two steel crutches?” He was in an orphanage and I think he was 14 years old at the time, and he looked out and he said, “All I want for Christmas is someone to love me and take me home. He said, “Joe, what would you say if I told you they adopted that young?” I said, “I’d fucking fold.” He said, “Well, they did, Joe.” He said, “I’ve learned something,” he said, ” … over my years, too.” He said, “It’s always appropriate to question other man or woman’s motive.” I mean, excuse me, ” … judgment, but never their motive. You don’t know what it is, and once you question their motive you can never get to an agreement, by saying, ‘You’re in the pocket of or you,’ or, ‘You missed that,’ and then, ‘By the way, let’s have an education bill.’ They’re not going to work with you. So I’ve been awfully successful getting things done in the past and bringing people together because I don’t question motive. The other area is, I’ve said that next year I’m going to inherit a world in disarray. My whole professional career and academic career has been all foreign policy and national security. And that’s what it’s going to be now. One of the reason I’m running, but that’s why I think you will not find many Republican senators or House members, even the ones I didn’t know, will ever tell you I misrepresented anything to them. I think there’s a lot we can agree on. And with Trump out of the way, I think we can agree on dealing with some of the problems out there, particularly problems in education, infrastructure, healthcare, all those issues that are all being separated now. And that’s why I think we get so much done. Look, we also have a tremendous opportunity to build back, but not just build back, build back better. We can’t afford not to open our doors and our ears and our hearts. President, I’m going to make sure that we leave nobody out, but it’s also on us, each of us, each of us, to do our part to heal the divisions in this country. Let me ask you a question, rhetorically. When’s the last time you thanked somebody? When’s the last time, if you were out in the Harrisburg area, you have a major storm, in your storm sewer outside, there was a guy out there cleaning it out so your basement wouldn’t flood. Did you walk out and say, “Thank you”? Or on your way to go to him or her, say, “Thank you”? When’s the last time we looked at each other and said, “Can I help you?” Uniting this country requires leadership, but it also happens one person at a time. In your community sometimes, and you don’t plan this, reach out to others, try to, as my mom would say, walk a mile in their shoes. Look to building bridges, not to tear them down. We can disagree, but we don’t have to be disagreeable. That’s what I’ll do as president, and it’s how, together, I think we can start to heal this country. But we have to treat, concluding comment, my dad used to always say, this is God [inaudible 00:54:38], my word as a Biden, “Joey, everybody, everybody deserves to be treated with dignity. No exceptions. Everybody deserves to be treated with dignity.” Treat people with dignity and they’ll return it, I think. Thank you. Thank you. And thank you, Jim Bo, for that question. Thank you, Paula, in Turquoise delegates. We want to thank our fellow delegates who were able to channel those questions that came in, and we had so much more, but we needed to hear from you, Vice President Biden, about what you would bring to this. And we thank you for spending this time with us. Before you go, we want to give you just a few minutes if you want to make any final comments, as you asked these delegates for their support. Well, first of all, thanks for considering me, number one. Number two, I’ve been arguing a long time, because I’ve been listening to my wife, by the way, my deceased wife was a teacher as well, that education should be putting more in the hands of educators. You should have more input on what you teach, how you teach it, and when you teach it. You are the ones in the classrooms. You should have more input. And I really mean this. I’m not just trying to be nice. You are, and you need that more. So first of all, this is going to be a much more teacher-centric education system. I grant it, the vast majority of the funding comes out of the state and local communities, but the portion that’s federal you’re going to have a major say on how it’s spent, where it’s spent, and on what it’s spent. Next thing I’d like to say to you all is that one thing that really always bothered me was the way even in quote educated people, when you’re walking in a reception line somewhere and someone says, “And what do you do?” And say, “I teach.” They go, “Oh, okay.” Next person. ” What did you do?” “Well, I own a boutique, and I do … ” “Oh, tell me about your boutique.” Or, “I have a startup company,” or, “I’m sales with such and such.” You are, and I’m not joking about this, you are the most important profession in the United States. You are the ones that give, as the old expression goes, give these kids wings. You give them confidence. You let them believe in themselves. You equip them. And I promise you, you will never find in American history, a president who is more teacher-centric and more supportive of teachers than me, because Jill has a great expression, “Joe, any country that out educates us is going to out-compete us.” It’s time we raised the game and make you the managers. Thank you all for considering me. Lilith, thank you a lot. I appreciate everything you’ve done for me. I really do, and I hope you’ll consider endorsing me. Thank you so much, Vice President Joe Biden, the PAC recommendation to become the next President of the United States. The decision will be made by mail-in ballot. It is possible to do mail ballots in a very good way. [crosstalk 00:58:32]. Yes it is. We’re going to do that. It’ll come to the homes of these almost 8,000 delegates, and we will be counting those in August. And so, Vice President Biden, it’s been an honor to have you in our house today. God bless and be safe. Well, if I get to the White House, you’ll be in my house too. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you."
"86","07-04-20"," Our country was founded on an idea, “We hold these truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal.” We’ve never lived up to it. Jefferson himself didn’t. He held slaves, women were excluded, but once proposed it was an idea that couldn’t be constrained. It survived the ravages of the Civil War, the dogs of Bull Connor, the assassination of Martin Luther King and more than 200 years of systemic racism, and just weeks ago the murder of George Floyd. Through it all, these words have gnawed at our conscience and pulled us towards justice. American history is no fairy tale. It’s been a constant push and pull between two parts of our character, the idea that all men and women, all people are created equal, and the racism that has torn us apart. We have a chance now to give the marginalized, the demonized, the isolated, the oppressed a full share of the American dream. We have a chance to rip the roots of systemic racism out of this country. We have a chance to live up to the words that have founded this nation. This Independence Day let’s not just celebrate the words, let’s celebrate that promise and commit to work, the work that we must do to fulfill that promise. We remain locked in the battle for the soul of this nation, but believe me, truly, it’s a battle we can and we will win if we act together. Happy Fourth."
"87","07-09-20"," Hello everyone. Well, let me start off by saying hello to Theresa Casey, and the guy that hangs out with her occasionally, and Bobby. Thank you. Thanks for being here, and thanks for welcoming me home. And the McGregor family, all of them, including the long suffering wife who’s had to be the sister, like my sister, of a mayor for all those years. But I want to thank them all. And to Mayor Burk and Mayor Canetti, congratulations. And President Eric Dean. Mr. President, as I said earlier, the Ironworkers have been with me my entire career. The first operation to ever endorsed me in 1972. I wasn’t even old enough to be elected Senator and you guys endorsed me and I was able to turn 30 by the time I got sworn in, but at the time I was elected, I wasn’t old enough. And it’s great to be home. My dad is some Dunmore, Mr. Mayor and my mom was from Scranton. And I want to thank, I want to thank Bob and everyone here at the McGregor Industries for showing me around this morning, although I knew of this establishment for a long time, it’s only been around a hundred years, but this is the kind of small manufacturing business that demonstrates that the resilience, the creativity, and the staying power of the American industrial base. You know, I’m not telling you anything new, but we’re living through a time unlike any other in American history. Our country is facing three simultaneous crises. A pandemic that’s infected over 3 million Americans and cost thus far over 130,000 lives. Bobby, three times a week I’m on the phone with the national folks, the docs who were head of CDC and other places before. The expectation is they think it get as high as 200,000 before it’s over. And it shows no sign of slowing down. We have an economic crisis that’s left almost 18 million Americans out of work, with some of the greatest pain inflicted on small businesses and communities of color. A national reckoning on the issue of racial injustices also, that’s long plagued the United States of America, long plagued dark country. It’s come on top of a widening economic inequity and a mounting climate crisis. Each of these, each of these crises, is an enormous challenge that’s testing our strength, our patience, our resilience, and our commitment to our core values, and a commitment to one another. But each of these also presents tremendous opportunity for the nation, an opportunity to prepare now for the future threats we know are just around the corner, an opportunity to address fundamental inequities of our nation, the growing gap between the very wealthy and everyone else. It’s an opportunity to finally and fully live up to the words and the values enshrined in our founding documents of this nation, that we’re all created equal, or we’re entitled to be treated equally for the rest of our lives. Not just created equal, to be treated equally. We all know the stakes couldn’t be higher. That’s why it’s no time for the divisive politics we’re hearing more about today. Donald Trump may believe that pitting Americans against Americans will benefit him. I don’t. We have a health crisis, an economic crisis, a racial justice crisis, a climate crisis. We need to come together to solve these crises, to solve them as Americans. This is our moment to imagine, and to build a new American economy for our families and for our communities, an economy where every American, every American has a chance to get a fair return for the work they put in, an equal chance to get ahead. My grandpa, when I lived with him down in Greenridge, used to talk about, “Everybody, everybody Joey deserves a shot. Just a shot. Everybody.” An economy that is more powerful we can build precisely because everyone will be cut in on the deal this time, as we rebuild the middle class, this time bringing everyone along. Everybody. An economy that says investing in American people and working families is more important than the nearly $2 trillion in tax breaks predominantly handed out to the super wealthy. Donald Trump loves to talk and talk and talk. But after three and a half years of big promises, what do the American people have to show for all the talk? He promised a healthcare plan, but never even offered his own bill as he continues to try to wipe out Obamacare in the middle of a pandemic. Instead, he’s fought repeatedly to take healthcare away from tens of millions of people who didn’t have it before, and over a hundred million people who were covered because they had preexisting conditions now that they couldn’t have gotten coverage for before. He promised an infrastructure plan to deliver, deliver on jobs and opportunities. We’re rated as having the 23rd, ranked 23rd in the world in terms of our transportation infrastructure. He promised to bring back jobs, but manufacturing was in recession even before COVID-19. He promised to buy American, then they let federal contractors double the rate of offshoring jobs in his first 18 months. I’m going to change that. We’re going to double the tax on foreign profits so we don’t encourage people to leave and build abroad. And when it comes to COVID-19, after months of doing nothing other than predicting the virus would disappear or maybe if you drank bleach you may be okay, Trump has simply given up. He’s waved the white flag. He’s walked away and his failures come with a terrible human costs and deep economic toll. Time and again, working families are paying the price for this administration’s incompetence. There’s no other way to say it than incompetence. Small businesses have ended up with the short end of the stick as well. Big businesses, the wealthy, Trump’s cronies and pals, they’d be the big winners. As Senator Casey can tell you, they wrote in the law there had to be oversight, an inspector general to make sure where that money went. I’m the guy that had responsibility of handing out $84 billion in the Recovery Act in the financial recession. I met once every two weeks with the inspectors general, everything was open. What are we finding out now? That large chains and hotel chains and chains of restaurants, they divided all the restaurants up and treated them as individual restaurants, they’re already making hundreds of millions of dollars. The mainstream mom and pop businesses, they didn’t get the money. The truth is throughout this crisis, Donald Trump has been almost singularly focused on the stock market, the Dow and NASDAQ, not you, not your families. If I am fortunate enough to be elected president, I’ll be laser focused on working families, the middle class families I came from here in Scranton, not the wealthy investor class. They don’t need me, but working families do. And this maybe, should be in my view, the guiding principle, we must reward work as much as we’ve rewarded wealth, but now we just reward excessive wealth. You see growing up rich and looking down on people as a bit different than how I grew up up here. Here nobody thought and understood, nobody thought, but also knew that Wall Street bankers and CEOs didn’t build this country. You can just look around your neighborhood or your kitchen table and see who built this country. It was at my grandfather Finnegan’s kitchen table in Greenwich that I learned, money doesn’t determine your worth. He’d say, “Joey, No one in the world is more worthy than you and everyone is equally worthy.” My dad used to have an expression, and the people who follow me I know they’re probably tired of me saying it, but he meant it, and I never understood it as well as I have the last 15 years, he said, “Joey a job’s about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in your community. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, “Honey, it’s going to be okay.” And mean it.” You know, Mr. President, over 56% of the American people think their kids will never, never reach the standard of living they had. And folks, we know who built this country, hardworking folks like you grew up with. And you know who built the middle class? Unions, built the middle class. That’s why we have a middle class. I had an uncle who’d said, ” Joey, your labor from belt buckle to shoe sole.” Well, I’ve taken pride in that because the only way my dad would say you deal with power is with power, with power. In corporate America, and I come from the corporate state of the world, Delaware. The only way to deal with abuse of power is with power and labor, unions are the only one that have that capacity to do it. If that’s raining outside, come on in guys. I don’t want anybody out there… Are you guys in the rain? Or is that not rain? Okay, I thought that was rain. It is, you guys can come on in, don’t stay out there. But look, determination, resilience and grit, the strength to get up, no matter how many times you get knocked down, respect for hard work and for the people who do it. These are the values I grew up with and all of you have grown up with. These are the values that I’m going to take with me to the oval office. I’ll get more help to mainstream business and entrepreneurs and ask more of corporate America. Nearly half of the jobs in America are small business jobs. And even back as early as May, some estimates found that more than 100,000 small businesses have been permanently shut down, more have closed and it’s been devastating. So enough is enough, it’s time to reverse the priorities in this country. It’s time to help small businesses, middle class folks manage their way through a pandemic. Let’s help millions of would be entrepreneurs get out from under their debts so they can start businesses. And it’s time corporate America paid their fair share of taxes. We thought in our administration we should lower the tax in the high 30s to 28%, [inaudible 00:14:46] lowered it to 21, I’m going to raise it back up to 28, provide hundreds of billions of dollars to invest in the growth of this country. And the days of Amazon paying nothing in federal income tax will be over. Let’s make sure their workers have a power and a voice, it’s way past time we put an end to the era of shareholder capitalism. The idea the only responsibility a corporation has is with shareholders, that’s simply not true, it’s an absolute farce. They have responsibility to their workers, their community, to their country. That isn’t a new or radical notion, these are basic values and principles that helped build this nation in the first instance. Now the challenge is to take these fundamental values and apply them to a new economy, we have to build in the years ahead. And folks it’s not sufficient to build back, we have to build back better. That’s what my plan is to build back better. It’s bold, it’s practical and it’s focused on building an economy for the future, not for the past. And it responds to the five truths laid out in this moment of crisis. The first is that we’ve seen in the course of this pandemic that we need to strengthen our industrial base as longterm sources of middle class job creation. Let’s use this opportunity to take bold investments in American industry and innovation so the future is made in America, all in America. I do not accept a defeatist view that forecasted automation and globalization mean we can’t keep well paid jobs here in America and create more of them. I do not buy for one second that the vitality of American manufacturing is a thing of the past. America manufacturing was with a functioning arsenal of democracy in WW2, it has to be part of the engine of new prosperity in America now. So today I’m releasing a [inaudible 00:17:09] plan and I think the press has, how to create millions of good paying union jobs, building promising technologies that we need now and we’ll need in the future. And it starts with a pretty basic idea, when we spend taxpayers’ money, when the federal government spends taxpayers’ money, we should use it to buy American products and support American jobs. My plan would tighten the rules to make this a reality, and it goes further, during my first term alone, we’ll invest $400 billion in purchasing products and materials our country needs to modernize our infrastructure, replenish our critical stockpiles and enhance national security. That’s how much the federal government will spend on buying products, the federal government. These funds will provide reliable, predictable demand. We’ll provide reliable, predictable demand for products made by American workers and supply chains like this one right here for the American industries. We’ll purchase clean energy technologies, fight climate change, building materials, including steel products, like those produced here, stockpiles of critical goods and equipment and advanced technologies to modernize our government and enhance our national security. To ensure the future is made in America, we need to win not just the jobs of today we have to invest in what the jobs and industries of tomorrow are going to be. The Chinese are spending multiple billions of dollars trying to own the technology of the future while we sit with our thumb in our ear. That means fighting unfair trade practices, curbing the threat of intellectual property by countries like China. America can’t sit in the sidelines in a race to the future. That’s why I’m proposing a dramatic research and development investment of $300 billion in my first four years alone to sharpen American’s competitive edge in the new industries where global leadership is up for grabs like battery technology, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, clean energy. That’s the future. And this money will be used purposefully to ensure all of America’s in on the deal, including communities that historically been left out; black, Brown and native American entrepreneurs, cities, and towns everywhere in the region and the country. All told, this’ll be a mobilization of R&D and procurement investment in ways not seen since the great depression and World War two. In addition to bringing back the jobs that had been lost this year, my plan will help create at least 5 million, 5 million new, good paying jobs. As experts have looked at it in manufacturing and innovation and create them right here in the United States of America. The second thing we’ve seen the importance of a more resilient economy for the long term. Our President wasn’t prepared for this pandemic. He ignored the detailed briefings and warning that our administration left behind. The threat of a pandemic we told them was coming. We gave all this to his administration and transition, but he shut it all down. He shut down the pandemic office we had inside The White House. He praised the Chinese government, even as the virus was coming to our shores because he was so afraid that they’d walk away from his trade deal that cost us significant amounts of money as well. Let’s not get caught flat footed again. Let’s get prepared to meet the challenges of the climate crisis, that means investing in infrastructure, clean energy, creating millions of good paying union jobs in the process. Next week, I’ll be laying out an updated blueprint of how we can build a modern, safe, sustainable infrastructure and the clean energy economy, and how to make sure that the communities that have suffered the most from pollution are the first to benefit from this investment, how to strengthen the union movement, how to make sure that unions are building America, just like they built the middle class. Third thing, we’ve seen in this pandemic, the immense burden on working parents, especially women, they’re carrying as if they’re … They find themselves in a position where they’re working or attempting to work, they’re attempting to take care of their children who were young at the same time, they’re aging parents or need help and are suffering from disabilities. It’s been especially hard in this crisis, but let’s face it. It’s always hard. Let’s make it easier to afford childcare and care for our aging relatives, our moms and our dads. Let’s offer more, pay more economic dignity to millions of workers, often women, often women of color who are entrusted to help teach our youngest and care for our oldest at the same time. Donald Trump has no idea what it’s like to be a single parent who’s barely getting by, but needs to find childcare. He doesn’t have a clue what it’s like to provide for an aging parent and that’s understandable, but it’s unconscionable that he doesn’t even try to understand or empathize with the struggling of so many millions of people out there like a lot of you. I’ll bet there’s a lot of you out there in the audience, including the press, you understand that personally. I understand it. I know how hard it is to be a single dad who asked to work with two young sons at home. I know what it means to bring your aging parents into your home in the last months of their lives, care for them as well. I’ve done both and I had great help. I have a really close family and I was a US Senator making $42,000 a year at a time. I’ve done both. It’s hard, but it’s so much harder for millions of Americans are trying to make ends meet. In the weeks ahead, I’ll be laying out a plan to mobilize American talent and hearts to build a 21st century caregiving and education workforce. The fourth thing we’ve seen is millions of American workers and small businesses. Business owners put their lives on the line to keep their county or should be their country going. We need to treat these folks and their families as essential, not just in times of crisis, but all times. We call these folks the essential worker. I think the blinders have been taken off the bulk of the American people. Those who could afford to stay at home and stay in place. They look out there and they realize it was that grocery store clerk stacking the shelves. It was that nurse’s aid trying to find protective gear to take care of someone that’s on a ventilator. It’s that truck driver. It’s that mail delivery person. The essential worker, you see these ads will be clap for them as they come down the street. First responders. Well, it’s time we not only clap for them, it’s time we pay them. The idea that every one of them is not worth at least a minimum of $15 an hour, or spend time with frontline workers and then tell them they shouldn’t have the right to organize and become part of a union, organized for better pay, for paid leave, for benefits, for working conditions, where we insist that they have safe and sanitary conditions to work in. Maybe it is possible for him to ignore it, but I can’t and I won’t. There’s not enough just to praise these workers. We need to pay them. Let’s finish the job of Obamacare by ensuring everyone has access to quality, affordable healthcare. Let’s lower the cost of prescription drugs and stop the surprise billing and provide public options to cover the millions of Americans who are without healthcare, by adding it to Obamacare. Let’s make sure everyone has access to good education, regardless of the zip code. Let’s triple the amount of money we spend on Title One schools. Those are Title One schools and you have 18 of them, 18 of Title One schools in Scranton and Dunmore. It means that they’re very low tax basis so they’re having trouble keeping teachers. I’d triple the amount of money we spend on those from $15 billion a year to $45 billion, raising the salaries for the teachers in those schools up to $60,000 a year, making sure every single solitary child, aged three, four, and five is able to go to school, not daycare, Mr. Mayor. All the data shows and studies show whether it’s [inaudible 00:26:26] or it’s at University of Pennsylvania, anywhere around, that that increases above 58% to chance that that child will go all the way through and graduate without having any trouble. Imagine what a big difference it will make. I think because of this pandemic, everyone has renewed appreciation for just how hard our teachers work, how important their job is. Let’s give them the resources and the support they need, both to get through this crisis and empower the next generation of American ground breakers. Let’s pay them. These aren’t somebody else’s children, they’re all our children. These aren’t somebody else’s children, they’re all our children. They’re the children. Those children are the kite strings that hold our national ambitions aloft. And our teachers, our teachers are critical. And finally, we’ve seen with horrifying clarity, the cost of systemic racism, the need for a comprehensive agenda for racial equality in our country. It isn’t just about police reform. It’s about dealing with the deep wound of systemic racism in this nation. So we need a dedicated agenda to close the wealth gap, expand affordable housing, invest in brown and black and AAPI, Native American entrepreneurs, make real the promise of educational opportunity. For too long the battle for racial equality has divided America. It should be used now to unite us. Donald Trump cynically claims that he’s defending Americans’ heritage by embracing the Confederate flag and public monuments of generals who rebelled against and were treasonous against the United States of America, people who tried to permanently rip this nation apart. I see a different America than Trump, one that despite all our flaws and shortcomings and failings, is still, after more than two centuries, dedicated to equality, liberty and human dignity. The challenges we face today are among the biggest than our history. We have to come together in this country to solve them. There’s no other way. I got criticized during the primaries by saying I was running for three reasons, restore the soul of America, number two, to rebuild the backbone of the country, the middle class, and three, unite America. And I was told you can’t unite it. If we can’t unite America, we’re done. I’ve long said America is at its best when we act as one nation, one America. That’s the tragedy of Donald Trump being president today. He’s exactly the wrong person to lead at this moment. He’ll not bring this country together. He’s determined to drive us apart, to keep his base in place. He’ll not be president for all the American people, his base. He believes he was elected president only by his base, and he’ll not appeal to the best instincts in the rest of us. He’s determined to stroke and revive the worst moments from our past. I have no illusion how tough the road ahead is going to be for our country, but I’m an optimist for one reason above all others. I know the history and the heart of this country, and given a chance, just a chance, ordinary Americans can and have done extraordinary things, and they’ll never ever, ever let their country down given half a chance. They won’t let it down. The only thing that can tear America part, and I mean this sincerely, no foreign country, not the way he coddles up to, well, I shouldn’t even get into this, but coddles up to Putin and others. They can’t tear us apart. The only entity, the only thing that can tear America apart is America itself, period. So we just need to remember who we are. This is the United States of America. There is not a single thing, nothing, not a single thing we’ve ever failed to do when we’ve decided to do it together. That’s what this is about, doing it together. We have a great opportunity to build back and build back better. God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. Thank you."
"88","07-14-20"," Good afternoon. I’m here today to talk about infrastructure, and jobs, and our clean energy future. But I have to start by speaking about what millions of Americans know when they wake up every morning with worry, anxiety and fear. We’re still a country in crisis. The pandemic has affected more than three million Americans. It has cost more than 135,000 lives and climbing. And it shows no signs of slowing down. In just the last few days, 19 states, 19 states reported record cases, including Florida, which saw more than 15,000 new cases in a single day. Hospitalizations and deaths, two of the most concerning indicators of Trump’s failed response, are already unacceptably high. And they are rising. It’s gotten bad enough that even Donald Trump finally decided to wear a mask in public. I’m glad he made the shift. But, Mr. President, it’s not enough. We won’t be able to turn the corner and get American people back to work safely without presidential leadership. Mr. President, open everything now isn’t a strategy for success. It’s barely a slogan. Quit pushing the false choice between protecting our health and protecting our economy. All it does is endanger our recovery on both fronts. Mr. President, please listen to your public health experts instead of denigrating them. Do your job, Mr. President. Because, if we can’t deal with the public health crisis, we can’t deal with the economic crisis or deal with almost 18 million Americans who are out of work and the incredible pain inflicted on small businesses and communities of color. We can’t deal with the climate crisis that could cast us into an even darker and more permanent shadow that would loom over the country in the world for a long time. We won’t be able to do what Americans have always done, come back stronger than ever before with the grit, toughness, and resilience that characterizes who we are. That’s what I want to talk about today. Last week I shared the outlines in my plan to build back better, a bold plan to build an economy of the future, not an economy of the past. And the first plank of that plan rejects the defeatist view that automation and globalization mean we can’t ensure our future is made in America with American, good paying union jobs, here at home, making it in America. We clearly can. Today, I’m here at Wilmington to talk about a second plank, how we could create millions of high paying union jobs by building a modern infrastructure and a clean energy future. These are the most critical investments we can make for the longterm health and vitality of both the American economy and the physical health and safety of the American people. Even if we weren’t facing a pandemic and an economic crisis, we should be making these investments anyway. One in five miles of our highways are still in “poor condition” according to the American Engineers. Ten thousands… actually, tens of thousands of bridges are in disrepair, and some on the verge of collapse, presenting a clear and present danger to people’s lives. Tens of millions of Americans lack access to high speed broadband. To get our people to work and our kids at school safely, to get our kids to market swiftly, to power clean energy revolution in this country, we need to modernize America’s infrastructure. Despite this overwhelming need, this president and the Republican Congress has simply failed to act. There’s no other way of saying it, to continue to break the promises they’ve made to the American people. Donald Trump promised a big infrastructure bill when he ran in 2016. He promised it again in 2017, and then in 2018, and again in 2019. And now, he’s promising one again. It seems like every few weeks, when he needs a distraction from the latest charges of corruption in his staff or the conviction of high ranking members of his administration and political apparatus, the White House announces “it’s infrastructure week.” How many times you’ve heard him say that? But he’s never delivered. He’s never really even tried. Well, I know how to get it done. In 2009, President Obama and I inherited an economy in free fall. And we prevented another great depression. We enact the largest infrastructure plan since President Eisenhower’s interstate highway system, not only creating good paying jobs, but improving the safety and security of people on our roads. We made the largest investment in clean energy in the history of the United States of America, 90 billion dollars. And it put us on a path toward a thriving, clean energy economy, powering new economic growth and reducing energy costs. Here we are now with an economy in crisis, but with an incredible opportunity, not just to build back to where we were before, but better, stronger, more resilient, and more prepared for the challenges that lie ahead. And there’s no more consequential challenge that we must meet in the next decade than the onrushing climate crisis. Left unchecked, it is literally an existential threat to the health of our planet and to our very survival. That’s not up for dispute, Mr. President. When Donald Trump thinks about climate change, the only word he can muster is hoax. When I think about climate change, the word I think of is jobs, good paying union jobs that will put Americans to work, making the air cleaner for our kids to breathe, restoring our crumbling roads, and bridges, and ports, making it faster, cheaper, and cleaner to transport American made goods all across the country and around the world. Jobs. Jobs to build and install a network of 500,000 charging stations along our existing and new highways we built across this country. Which, not only will it help America and the American automobile industry, leading the world of manufacturing with electric vehicles, it will also save Americans billions of dollars over time in the cost of gasoline for their vehicles. Jobs that lay the lines for the second great railroad revolution, which will not only slash pollution, will slash commute times and open up investment in areas connected to metropolitan centers for the first time. When Donald Trump thinks about renewable energy, he sees windmills somehow causing cancer. When I think about these windmills, I see American manufacturing, American workers racing to dominate the global market. I see the steel that will be needed for those windmill platforms, towers, and ladders that can be made in small manufacturers like the McGregor Industries. I was up in Scranton last week. I see the union train and certified men and women who will manufacture and install it all. I see the ports that will come back to life, the longshoreman, the shipbuilders, the communities they support. When Donald Trump talks about improving efficiency by retrofitting lighting systems with LED bulbs, you remember what he said? He said he doesn’t like LED because, “the light is no good. I always look orange.” The lights no good. I always look orange. When I think about energy retrofitting for lighting, I see the incredible projects, like the one right here in the Chase Center. I see small businesses like Preferred Electric that design and install award-winning energy conservation measures, reduce consumption of electricity, and save businesses hundreds of thousands of dollars in energy costs per year. I see master electricians and union workers who work through a union apprenticeships who start off with good wages and quality benefits that only grow from there. These investments are a win, win, win for this country, creating jobs, cutting energy costs, protecting our climate. That’s why today I’m releasing my plan to mobilize millions of jobs by building sustainable infrastructure and an equitable clean energy future. In my first four years, we’re going to give four million buildings all across this country the same energy makeover that you get here at Chase, the Chase Center. It’s going to create at least one million jobs in construction, engineering, and manufacturing in order to get it done. It’s going to make places, the places where we work, we live, we learn healthier, improving indoor air quality and water quality. That’s going to save tens of billions of dollars in energy costs over time. That’s all real. We’re not just going to focus on commercial spaces though. We’re going to give direct support to help families do the same thing for their homes. We’re going to offer cash rebates and low cost financing to upgrade energy inefficient appliances and windows, improvements that will cut their monthly energy bills and, over time, save them thousands of dollars a year. We’re going to make a major investment to build 1.5 million new energy efficient homes. And public housing units will benefit from all the communities three times over by alleviating the affordable housing crisis, by increasing energy efficiency, and by reducing the racial wealth gap linked to home ownership. Last week, I talked about using the purchasing power of the federal government to reinvigorate domestic manufacturing. That’s what we’re going to do with the American automobile industry as well. The United States owns and maintains an enormous fleet of vehicles. And we’re going to convert these government fleets to electric vehicles made and sourced right here in the United States of America with the government providing the demand and the grants to retool factories that are struggling to compete. The U.S. auto industry and its deep banks of suppliers will step up, expanding capacity so the United States, not China leads the world in clean vehicle production. We’re going to make it easier for American consumers to switch to electric vehicles as well, not only by building 500,000 charging stations, but by offering rebates and incentives to swap older fuel efficient vehicles for new clean made in America vehicles, saving hundreds of millions of barrels of oil on an annual basis. Together, this will mean one million new good paying jobs in the automobile industry and supply chain and the associated infrastructure needed to get it done. We also know that transforming the American electrical sector to produce power without producing carbon pollution and electrifying an increased share of our economy will be the greatest spurring of job creation and economic competitiveness in the 21st century. That’s why we’re going to achieve a carbon pollution free electric sector by the year 2035. We need to get to work on it right away. We’ll need the scientists at the National Labs, the land-grant universities, HBCUs to improve and innovate technologies needed to generate, store, and transmit this clean energy. We need the engineers to design them, the workers to manufacturer. We need ironworkers and welders to install them. We’ll become the world’s largest exporter of these technologies, creating even more jobs. We know how to do this. Our administration rescued the auto industry and helped it retool, made solar energy the same cost as traditional energy, weatherized more than a million homes. And we’ll do it again, but this time bigger, and faster, and smarter. And, as we do this work, we need to be mindful of the historical wrongs and the damage that American industries have done in the 20th century, inflicting environmental harm on the poor and vulnerable communities, so often black, and brown, and Native American communities. Polluted air, polluted water, toxins raining down from communities that bore the environmental and health burdens but shared none of the profits. Growing up breathing that in everyday, it’s poison. And it’s partly why there’s such incredible rates of childhood asthma in black and brown communities, why black Americans are almost three times more likely to die of asthma related causes than white Americans. It’s cancer alley in St. James Parish of Louisiana. It’s the cancer causing clusters along Route 9 right here in Delaware. And that’s why today I’m also releasing a State of the Environment justice policies that build on my existing plan. This is an area of incredible opportunity for economic growth for our country. But we have to make sure that the first people who benefit from this are the people who were most basically hurt by it historically in the last century by the structural disparities that exist. I’m setting a goal to make sure that these frontline and fence line communities, whether they’re in rural places or in center cities, receive 40% of the benefit from the investments we’re making in housing, and pollution reduction, in workforce development, in transportation across the board. We’re also going to create jobs for people by cleaning up the environmental hazards that have now been abandoned. You saw the front page of the Times two days ago. All these places that are going bankrupt, except for the benefit that’s going, millions and millions of dollars, to the CEO’s. More than a quarter million jobs right away to do things like plugging millions of abandoned oil and gas wells that exist all across the country, posing daily threats to the health and safety of our communities. We’re going to hold accountable those CEO’s and corporations that benefit from decades of subsidies, then just walked away from their responsibilities to these communities, leaving the wells to leak, pollutants to continue to spew, greenhouse gases flowing into the air and the water. We’re not only going to repeal those subsidies. We’re going to go after those golden parachutes the CEO’s gave themselves before declaring bankruptcy to make sure that workers receive the benefits and retirement they were promised. Let’s create new markets for our family farmers and our ranchers, a new modern day civilian climate corp to heal our public lands, to make us less vulnerable to wildfires and floods. Look, these aren’t pie in the sky dreams. These are actionable policies that we can get to work on right away. We can live up to our responsibilities, meet the challenges of a world at risk of a climate catastrophe, build more climate resilient communities, put millions of skilled workers on the job, and make life markedly better and safer for the American people all at once and benefit the world in the process. The alternative, continue to ignore the facts, deny reality, focus only on technology of the last century instead of inventing the technology that will define this century. It’s just plain un-American not to. This is all that Donald Trump and the Republicans offer, backward looking policies that will harm the environment, make communities less healthy, hold back economic promise, while other countries race ahead. It’s a mindset that doesn’t have any faith in the capacity of the American people to compete, to innovate, and to win. It’s never been a good bet to bet against the American people. And, when you do, it will exact a deadly cost. I know better. I know you do as well. I know what the American people are capable of. I know what American workers can accomplish when given the room to run. I know that climate change is a challenge that’s going to define our American future. I know meeting the challenge will be a once in a lifetime opportunity to jolt new life into our economy, strengthen our global leadership, protect our planet for future generations. And, if I have the honor of being elected president, we’re not just going to tinker around the edges. We’re going to make historic investments that will seize the opportunity and meet this moment in history. We’re going to get to work delivering results right away on day one. We’re going to reverse Trump’s roll backs of 100 public health and environmental rules, and then forge a path to greater ambition. We’re going to get back into the Paris Agreement, back into the business of leading the world. We’re going to lock in progress that no future president can roll back or under cut to take us backward again. Science requires a timetable for measuring progress on climate that isn’t three decades or even two. Science tells us we have nine years before the damage is irreversible. So, my time table for results is my first four years as president, the jobs that we’ll create, the investments we’ll make, and the irreversible steps we’ll take to mitigate and adapt to the climate change and put our nation on the road to net zero emissions no later than 2050. So, let’s not waste any more time. Let’s get to work now, now. Thank you."
"89","07-21-20"," Good afternoon, everybody. I want to thank the Colonial Early Education Program, Aaron Callwick center for hosting us tonight. I just met Sarah Johnson. I thought I saw Sarah somewhere in here, but she has her three year old son, Noah, who’s a student here. She said this program does wonders helping Noah learn his letters and numbers and socialize with other kids and understand his emotions and develop his personality. And I met him. He’s a bright, cute young man. But like so many parents, she’s worried. She’s worried about her job as a dental assistant and the notching changes and what she has to do to make things work, as she’s noticing changes in Noah’s behavior, since he hasn’t been in school since March. As a matter of fact, he said to the principal, “Where’s my teacher? Can I stay here and play?” We were in his classroom. And she’s had to lean on her parents, which many, many people have to do to help her get through it. And it’s really tough, but parents like Sarah, places like this center and the caregivers and educators that work here also give me a great deal of hope. Reinforcing my absolute determination that I’m pushing for over two years to triple the amount of money for Title I schools in those districts like this one, where every child, every child and Title I district is able to have the benefits of an education at three and four years age. That’s why I couldn’t think of a better place to talk about the third plank of mine Build Back Better plan for the economy. This is about easing the squeeze on working families who are raising their kids and caring for aging loved ones at the same time, sometimes separately, but many times together. And it’s about creating jobs with better pay and career pathways for caregivers and showing them that dignity and respect that they deserve. But I know it’s hard. I know it’s hard to think of a future when you’re just trying to get through the crisis at hand. I know that the case of childcare facilities across the nation is dire. People are looking for help desperately, and they’ve had to close their doors and lay off staff. And they’re not getting the protective equipment they need to reopen. The virus hotspots where they exist, and they exist all over the nation, they can’t reopen it all. And we’re in a childcare emergency and it didn’t have to be this way. That’s why I’m calling on the president to get the facilities and the resources and the equipment that are needed and get them to them now. Enough. Each day, the pandemic death toll grows each day, in some states, more people test positive the day before, an each day too many American workers are still out of work and losing hope. It’s been reported by the president’s staff, that the president is quote, “Not really working this anymore.” He doesn’t want to be distracted by it. Doesn’t want to be distracted by it. His own staff admits that Donald Trump fails the most important test of being an American president, the duty to care for you, for all of you. It’s also been reported that he’ll block any funding for more testing and tracing in the next COVID relief bill, which is being discussed right now on the floor of the United States Congress, just as states report record cases and hospitalizations and deaths continue to rise. This man simply doesn’t understand. He can’t deal with our economic crisis without serving and saving and solving the public health crisis. For all his bluster about his expertise on the economy, he’s unable to explain how he’ll actually help working families hit the hardest. Now he’s quit on you and he’s quit on this country. But this election is not just about him. It’s about us. It’s about you. It’s about what we’ll do. What a president’s supposed to do. President’s supposed to care, to lead, to take responsibility, to never give up. That’s what presidents are supposed to do. Over the last two weeks I’ve shared my agenda for economic recovery. I call it Build Back Better because we can’t just build back to the way things were before. We have to do it better. And the first plank of my Build Back Better plan rejects the defeatist view that automation and globalization mean we can assure American workers lead to a future made in America. Made in America. The second plank helps us out compete the rest of the world and tackle climate change. I’ll put millions of Americans to work in good union jobs, modernizing their infrastructure, while building a clean energy future, increasing jobs. Today I’m outlining the third plank in my Build Back Better program, mobilizing a 21st century care and elderly childhood education workforce, to deal with the caregiving crisis. And it’s a crisis in this country. If we truly want to reward work in this country, we have to ease the financial burden of care that families are carrying. We have to elevate the compensation of those providing the care, the benefits and dignity of caregiving workers and early childhood educators. Even before the pandemic, millions of working families are faced with enormous financial personal strains trying to raise their kids and care for their parents or loved ones who are living with disabilities. This is the so called sandwich generation. Includes everyone from an 18 year old daughter caring for her mom who suddenly gets sick to a 40 year old dad raising his child and caring for his own aging parents. The joy and love are always there, but it’s hard. I know it’s hard. It’s really, really hard. Families are squeezed emotionally and financially. They need help, but too often, they can’t afford it. And the professional caregivers out there, the home health care workers, childcare workers, are more often women, women of color and immigrants are too often underpaid, unseen and undervalued. The pandemic hits and squeezes and tightens on everybody. Nursing homes have been hit hard. If you’re a frontline worker, you struggle to find safe childcare for your kids. Others of you have become unexpected 24/7 caregivers trying to keep your children safe and learning while you continue to work remotely from home. If you had to put your career on hold indefinitely, or seen your hours cut, or your job lost, the confusion, the confusion over school reopening only makes things worse. In the last few months has only underscored how vital it is for families and older Americans to have more home care and community care choices that fit their real needs. We’re trapped in a caregiving crisis within an economic crisis, within a healthcare crisis. You’re doing everything you can, but this president is not. If I’m your president, here’s what I would do. First, let’s start by caring for aging relatives and loved ones with disabilities, helping them live independently. Here’s an example. Right now there are 800,000 people who are eligible for home and community care through Medicaid who have already signed up for it. But they’re waiting for a phone call, phone call back. For some the wait is five years. Five years. My plan makes a bold investment so states can clear the waiting list. To make sure we ease the financial burden for more families going forward, we have to make the long term federal investments. We’ll have a major innovation fund that allow states to test and expand successful ways to improve home and community care and increase prevention and reduce the cost of hospitalization. Think of expanded vital services like rides to appointments, meals, day programs for seniors, making their home safer for them. It builds on an innovative and created provision under the Affordable Care Act. The very program the president ceaselessly is trying to gut. For example, there was a pilot program now in 27 cities, in 16 states where a nurse, an occupational therapist and a handyman come to the home that’s caring for an aging family member. They might not be able to cure a mom’s Alzheimer’s, but they can make sure she doesn’t break her hip. So they walk through the house. This is what’s going on now. And they install handrails in the right spots in the house, in the bathroom, or they fix the door or that’s stuck so she doesn’t trip while she tries to open it. It initially found that about $3,000 in program costs yield more than $20,000 in saving to the government from hospitalization for other reasons. Simple steps to save lives, save money, and provide critical peace of mind. Here’s another example. Whether you live in rural North Carolina, central Philadelphia, people of color are economically distressed communities faced punishing health disparities from a system of systemic discrimination. They don’t have health insurance. They don’t see a doctor. Sometimes language is a barrier and they slip through the cracks, slip through the gaps. So their treatable condition, because they can’t afford to go to the doctor, becomes a chronic condition. That’s why community health workers are real heroes. They go into these communities. They make sure folks are getting the care they need. My plan puts to work 150,000 more of these workers in our communities throughout the country. These are the things we can do now. Secondly, we can also make high quality childcare affordable and accessible. My childcare plan is straightforward, straightforward. Every three and four year old child will get access to free high quality preschool like students have here. And low and middle income families won’t spend more than 7% of their income on childcare for children under the age of five. The most hard pressed working families most would have to spend a dime. Here’s how it works. They can either decide to get up to an $8,000 tax credit for childcare for middle class family with a couple of young kids spending 300 bucks a week in childcare, that means an annual savings of $8,000 in their pocket because it’s a tax credit. It means everything for working families, living paycheck to paycheck. Or the federal government would send funding to states, which then work with childcare providers to cover the costs for working families with young children, over 7% of their income would not have to be spent. So say, both parents are working, working and need childcare. You go to childcare.gov, which is created under the Obama Biden administration to help find childcare that works for you. Under my plan, it takes you to your state website. Local childcare centers pop up. You can call or fill in your information. You apply to which one you want to go to. The state then sends you a letter saying you’re approved and lays out the amount you’re going to pay. The state sends that information to the childcare provider and then the state reimburses the childcare center on the back end. You just pay what you’re supposed to pay, not a dime for some working families and no more than 7% for anyone else. You can do that. This would save families thousands of dollars, but more importantly, give them a peace of mind. There’s other common sense steps we can take, like expanding tax credits for businesses to build childcare facilities onsite. So you can go to work with your child, put them in a childcare center that the company got money for a tax credit for building, supporting more and more and giving peace of mind to a family. And when you’re finished work, take that child home. Supporting more after care weekend and summer care programs for families. Third, we expand access to caregiving. We need to pay and support caregivers beyond what they are now. They’re doing God’s work, but home health workers aren’t paid much, they have few benefits. 40% are still on SNAP or Medicaid. So my plan is direct. It gives caregivers and early childhood educators a much needed raise. No one should have to work more than one job to make ends meet. Under my health care plan that defends and expands Obamacare, there’ll be more affordable health insurance. I’ll make sure these workers have an effective way to unionize and collectively bargain to protect their rights and earn benefits. This plan will help workers, especially those without a college degree, help them gain new skills in good paying industries like healthcare and provides new pathways to advance their careers. For example, a home healthcare worker can have access to training needed to become an EMT or a nurse or physician’s assistant or even a doctor. Or the early childhood educator can receive coaching to keep delivering high quality learning experience. We can do this. The bottom line is that a mobilized caregiving and early education workforce would save families time and money, get their loved ones the care and early childhood education they need, and put more people to work, allowing husbands and wives to go back to work and providing many people the opportunity to get a job that’s a decent job caring. It keeps seniors in their homes. It’s a triple win. If they choose that. And recognize the realities facing modern families and provides them a much needed economic support in the middle of a pandemic. Just imagine if we can put three million Americans to work in new care and early childhood education and combined with my proposal to provide families with up to 12 weeks of paid family leave and medical leave, we can free up millions more people to join the paid labor force, increasing economic growth, meaning at least two million additional jobs, more economic growth for the nation. This is a fresh, bold way to build a critical part of the labor force and help us recover faster and stronger. When we usually talk about jobs packages there’s a big push on shovel-ready jobs. I’m the guy who you may remember managed the Recovery Act of 800 plus billion dollars. We’re always focused on shovel-ready jobs. What we can do immediately to get the money out to communities, but that’s what care jobs are. They are shovel-ready. The workers are ready now. These jobs can be filled now. Allowing millions of people, primarily women to get back to work now. Increasing the growth of the GDP and family income. That’s the right thing to do for our families and our most essential workers. And it’s a smart thing to do for our economy. Today millions of our people can’t fully pursue the jobs and careers they dream of due to the caregiving squeeze. That means tens of billions of dollars less in wages each year for our working families. It means more disruption for our business, fewer jobs and growth in our economy, slow. This is both a moral and an economic imperative for the nation in my view. And the way we pay for it is by rolling back unproductive tax cuts, some of the $2 trillion tax cut the president put through. Closing loopholes, unproductive tax cuts for high income real estate investors while ensuring high income earners pay their tax bills. We invest that, that would add up to $775 billion over 10 years. We invest that in building our economy back better than it was before, growing the economy stronger. Tomorrow I’ll be joining a virtual town hall with the SCIU members, home care workers, fast food workers, janitors, to hear directly from them about why this matters so much to them. Because you see, this is about something bigger. This is about dignity and respect for working people. And that’s precisely what this election is all about. Dignity and respect. The American people know they’re not being afforded dignity and respect in many of their jobs. And the American president has a duty to care for all of us, to see people where they are to understand what they’re through and what they want to be. As many of you know, I was a single parent for five years after my wife and daughter were killed and my two boys were badly injured. Even though I had a lot more support than a lot of people going through tough times today, it was hard. It was hard. If I didn’t have my mom, my sister and my brother, I don’t know how I’d been able to afford it. Then six years later when Jill and I got married, I said, how difficult was for her to start her teaching career while being a new mom with two kids in school. We care. Well, actually they weren’t in school yet now that I think about it, we cared for our parents at the end. My dad was months in hospice in our home, same with my mom and our entire family was there for our son Bo when he came home from a year in Iraq with a cancer that wasn’t whether he’d live, it’s just how long he would live. We know what it’s like, months upon months. We know so many of you are going through the same thing without the kind of help I had. But now everything, everything feels different. There’s just that feeling, that sense where you just don’t know if everything’s going to turn out okay, but I’m here to tell you that it can be, and it will be. My dad was an honorable decent man. His great regret, he never got to go to college. My dad like many of your parents, got knocked down a few times, but he always got back up. He worked hard to build a great middle class life for our family in Mayfield [inaudible 00:22:53] . But he used to have a saying, he’d say, “Joey, I don’t expect the government to solve my problems, but I sure in hell expect them to understand my problem. I understand to my very core. And I also know that together, we can do this. This is America. We don’t settle. We aspire and we succeed. So let’s get the heck up and get it done. Let’s get to work. As I go out my grandpa, heard me say this many times, go up to my grandpop’s house up in Scranton when dad lost his job, where he lived with my grandpa. Every time he’d walk out of the house, he’d yell, “Joey, keep the faith.” And my grandmom would yell, “No, Joey, spread it.” Let’s go spread the faith. We can do this. There’s not a single thing we cannot do. Thank you for listening. I look forward to having your questions at another time, but I’m off to another event. Thank you, Principal. Thank you for having us here. Appreciate it very, very much. Thank you, [inaudible 00:24:08]"
"90","07-22-20"," They talk to me mostly about not being able to spend that quality time with their family, not being able to see them like they normally do before the pandemic started. Their family members used to visit a lot, so they are more concerned about not being able to interact with other residents, other staff, and seeing their families on the regular. Yeah. Well, you know, it’s a smart thing to do for … what you guys are doing. It’s about something much bigger, though. It’s about making sure we provide dignity and respect for work you do. Yeah. I think the president has a duty to care about that, and that’s what I want to try to do with you all. I’m interrupting you here, keep going. Well, they are the future. Look, I look at it two ways: I had a friend who used to say, “It’s great when conscious and convenience cross paths.” My conscience knows because, look, I’ve been a significant recipient of caregiving, my mom and dad, separately, years apart, died in my home with hospice. I lost a wife and a daughter in an automobile accident, my two boys, I watched nurses and nurses’ aides nurse them back to health. I spent 18 months with my son Beau dying of stage-4 glioblastoma cancer, and I was hospitalized for a while, long time ago, with an aneurysm. I tell you what, doctors let you live, but nurses and nurses’ aides make you want to live. You give hope, you give hope, you’re incredibly, incredibly important to the psyche of families. I just can’t tell you … but secondly, you also, we’re in a situation with this pandemic where, if we do what we have to do and focus on dealing with making sure that we deal with caregivers in a way that we haven’t up to now, we can ensure in a financial burden is taken off of working families who are struggling to pay the cost of caring for their loved ones. In addition to that, we’re in a situation where you also deserve to be paid. Now, expanding the options for older Americans is a gigantic, gigantic opportunity, and for both in-care facilities, easing the financial burden, low- and middle-income families will, under my plan, spend no more than 7% of their income on childcare for kids under five, but also deal the same with expanding for the elder care. You got to expand options for older Americans. My plan expands options for older Americans to receive care at home as well. An example is, there’s a pilot program going on right now in 27 cities in 16 states where a nurse, an occupational therapist and a handyman go to visit a home of an aging family member, and they may not be able to cure Mom’s Alzheimer’s, but they can make sure she doesn’t fall and break her hip, they can walk through the house and install handrails in the right spots in the bathroom, fix the door so it doesn’t stick and she tries to open it, creating millions of jobs to help people in this economy recover. It saves a lot of money, it costs about 3,000 bucks to do that, but what it does is in fact saves hundreds of thousands of dollars so people aren’t hospitalized and the like. But what you do in a facility like the one you’re in is critical. You just give people hope, it really matters so much. You deserve to be paid better than you’re being paid now. Okay, I like that. No, I really mean it. What I hear where I’m at now is staff complaining about the proper PPE that we are to use when we come to work every day. So I hear what they … the protective wear. Yep. This is the isolation gown that you are to pin on your body before you do any type of care on any resident in the facility. [inaudible 00:04:47] that we are to wear, something like the one that I have on, to protect your face from anything. Yes, we do. That’s great. I’m glad about that, because my facility, we have enough PPE, they made sure of that from the beginning. We had a glitch in the system in the beginning, but now we are fully prepared. We have everything that we possibly need. I don’t think we ever got used to it. Yeah. It’s hot. The weather changed outside, it’s very hot to be wearing it, but we know it’s important. We have to wear it to protect ourselves. They got used to it. Yeah. Then once they started being more educated on the importance of us having it, because they wear it as well. It’s important for them to wear it as well. All right. Yes. Right here, I’m the resident’s room. And in this room, if it was two residents that occupied each bed, the amount of time that we would have to spend with these residents is around 15 minutes. Imagine only spending 15 minutes with a resident, especially when they need you the most. When you’re short-staffed, you can’t spend the quality time with your residents’ needs. Better pay wages. Yeah. -then we would be able to recruit more people. Well, that’s what I’m intending on making sure you’re able to do. Also, so you can also, at the same time, be in a position where you can, if you decide to, get additional training to go from being what you’re doing now as a nurse’s aide to become a practical nurse, to become a nurse. I mean, there’s ways we can do this that will greatly increase your opportunities, increase pay, increase the services that people have, and generate economic growth in the nation overall, helping everybody, because the more you get paid, the more taxes you pay; the more you spend, the more the economy grows. Right, right. And that’s what we need them to understand. I understand it, we’re going to make sure everybody else understands it too. I think people are realizing it, they’re realizing one of the reasons why they’ve been able to stay safe and stay home is because people like you are out there risking your lives every day, taking care of folks who need help, and no one else can take care of, and no one else is taking care of. I’m responsible for anywhere between 13 to 15 residents a day. Wow. And that’s a lot, and especially because we’re short-staffed and the pay is not good. That is a lot. Well, my son-in-law is a surgeon in Philadelphia at Jefferson Hospital, and he tells me, it’s not the same thing, but he tells me about the incredible stress on staff and nurses’ aides and nurses that exist throughout the whole system, but you have to do it every day. Yep. When are people going to open up the economy, because they want to be able to visit their family. They want to be able to see their family. They’re lonely. Yep. I said, one of the things we’re finding out nationally is there’s a lot of strain on mental health, there’s a lot of concern and anxiety, and there’s a need for psychologists and others to be able to get engaged and helping people deal with what’s happening in terms of their concerns about their anxieties. Well, we used to before this pandemic, and a lot of people are not able to come into the facility, so we are the ones who are to sit there and talk to them. Gotcha. So there’s no staff personnel that deal with mental health problems. No. And anxiety. Okay. That’s a big issue. Yeah, it really is, it’s a really big issue. That’s the reason why, one of the reasons why I joined a union. 10 years ago, I became a union delegate because the union allows us the opportunities to have a voice for our co-workers and for our residents. Yep. That’s why we need you. That’s why we need you to become president, so you can stand with us and help us with the Fight For 15 wages, affordable healthcare for all, union security, and for people to be allowed to join a union if they want to. Well, I guarantee you that’s my view. I’m union guy all the way through, and I think it’s the only way we can make sure that you get compensation and the patients have the best-trained people, and that you’re able to advance and learn more and more and increase your ability to give … do the job you do, and increase your pay as well. Yeah. My long-term healthcare goal will be for us to have better staffing, better wages, job security, and you as our president. Well, I can get you the first three if I get to be president, but thank you very, very much for saying that. And thank you for what you do, thank you for what you do. Like I said, it’s slightly different, but I watched the nurses’ aides helping my mom in hospice and my dad in hospice, and was in my home for months. I watched how they care, I watched how critical it was, and I watched what it did to their psyche, how it just helped them. It gave them some hope. I’m well. Good. This is Matt Yarnell, I’m president of our union, I’m super-excited to be able to jump here in for a minute while Shanrika is getting her service back up. Really appreciate you taking the time to meet with Shanrika and learn a bit more about her role as a caregiver in a nursing home. I was a former caregiver myself before I became president of our union here in Pennsylvania. Just real quick while we’re waiting for Shanrika, she lifted up, I think, the need for more staffing in nursing homes and the need to be able to really have a seat at the table when it comes to thinking about what the nursing-home industry and the long-term living industry looks like. We’re really excited to hear more from you about your thoughts on the plan that you unveiled yesterday around caregivers specifically and how we can really support the incredible work that Shanrika and her colleagues all around the country do as nursing home workers and long-term care workers. Last thing I’ll say before I let you answer that question is, COVID has wreaked havoc in a devastating way on nursing homes, we know that nationally, 57,000 deaths have been in nursing homes of nursing home residents, that’s more than 42% of the country’s deaths related to the pandemic. And in Pennsylvania specifically, we have 756 facilities where there’s been 21,000 cases, and actually about two-thirds, or 67% of the deaths in Pennsylvania have been in nursing homes. We’re really excited about the plan that you unveiled yesterday around caregiving, which is so important and wanted to hear a little more from you about how you are hoping to make advancements for folks like Shanrika who get up every day and care for those who can’t care for themselves in this country. Well, first of all, the caregivers in nursing homes should have a say in what they need. A lot of those places, including in your state, you pretend it isn’t true, but it is true, have not had the PPE they need to begin with. There’s an enormous burden on families financially, and there’s an enormous burden on the workers. Easing the financial burden on working families who are struggling to pay for the cost of caring for their loved ones. Now, no low- and middle-income family under my plan will spend more than 7% of their income, and they’re going to average, families … going to save them thousands of dollars a year. Expanding care options for older Americans, my plan expands option that, in fact … Americans receive care at home as well. I’m here. I beg your pardon? I didn’t hear. Anyway, you got 800,000 folks under Medicaid, trying to figure out how they can get home care help without having to go to a nursing home, so there’s a program in 26 states where you take an occupational therapist, a nurse as well as a handyman, they come to the home of those 800,000 people, because we’re going to give the states more money to find alternatives to deal with this. And while they might not be able to cure Mom’s Alzheimer’s, but they can make sure that she doesn’t break her hip when she walks to her door, as I told Shanrika, they find handles in bathrooms and they fix doors so they don’t stick. They’re creating of new jobs to help the economic recovery, and elevating the pay and dignity of work as well. These workers haven’t gotten respect they need, but what it does overall, this is a win-win-win. – low- and middle-income families going to be in a position where they can’t afford basic necessities to take care of their elderly parent or someone with a chronic disease. I’m sorry, I’m confused who I’m talking to here. Hello, Vice-President Biden. I just want to say I appreciate you doing this walk a day in my shoes, and thank you for everything. [crosstalk 00:19:47] Mr. Vice-President, I want to just say I appreciate Shanrika’s leadership here and know the technological challenges of living in the COVID world here, but she’s been an incredible leader of our union and we really look forward to working with you and your administration on the other side of this election to make sure that … the rules have been really not fair, frankly, to caregivers and nursing-home workers and to home-care workers across our country. We really look forward to working with you and your administration to make sure that folks like Shanrika, caregivers, have a seat at the table to figure out how do we come up with the solutions to make sure that people get the best care in the setting they choose and to make sure that workers have a right to be at that table, and make sure that they have a good life for the non-stop caregiving they do across this country. And they can also have a right to up their skillset. Sure. How do I … I couldn’t hear what you said. Well, they allowed us the opportunity, they always checked up on us to make sure that our facility had the right and proper PPE, and that every day we was well taken care of. Gotcha. “Are they providing everything?” So they have really been working firsthand, they have been going out to facilities, making sure that all the other facilities have proper PPEs as well. So they really had our backs during this whole pandemic. We need … depending on each unit, because every unit is run differently depending on the amount of residents that you have in the unit. Typically on the unit that I work, which is a short- stay unit, it holds 55 beds. … a short stay unit, it holds 55 beds. So we need at least the ratio for residents to CNA should at least be accounted for. It needs to be looked into. So we shouldn’t have no more than eight or nine residents to one CNA, especially if you have 55 residents. No facility should have to work with 15 to 20 residents a day. I agree. And look, let me ask you one more question. I’m sorry to hold you up, but it’s a big help to me. What has it meant to your family? Because I’ve done a lot of interaction with the folks doing what you do in hospitals, in community centers before this as well. A lot of people are worried that when they go home, they may be bringing home to their family the virus, and maybe bringing home to their family some problem. Well, I was saying that I was so scared in the beginning when this pandemic first came about and we was trying to protect ourselves. So I wasn’t able to see my family for like months, because I didn’t want to expose them to anything that I might come in contact with while I’m working. So it’s been a bit strained. Gotcha. No. Good. Not as I know of. I haven’t had any. Good. Well, I can’t tell you how much I appreciate you taking me on your tour. Mr. I just want to swing back in. Really appreciate Shanrika for her time here today, really leading us in the first of its kind virtual Walk a Day. And thank you, Mr. Vice President, and look forward to working with you and your administration in the future here. I know we’re going to move now, I think, to the worker roundtable, and so just wanted to appreciate both of you, and I look forward to this conversation being continued as we move into the future. It’s one that’s desperately needed. So thanks so much. Shanrika, thank you. As my mother would say, were she’s still alive, you’re doing God’s work good. Amen. You really are. No, you really are. Yes. I appreciate you. Thank you so much. I appreciate you doing this Walk a Day in My Shoes, and closing I just want to say my job is awesome. I love working at [Somerton 00:24:43] Center, and Somerton Center and myself thank you for doing this Walk a Day today. I really appreciate it. I hope I can come and actually walk it with you, physically walk it with you. I wish you could. I really do. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Take care, stay safe. Before the pandemic, we were already in crisis. I’ve always been an essential worker. I’ve always been an essential worker. I have always been an essential worker. This is about us, the people who are working to keep this country safe, keep this country clean, keep this country safe and healthy. We are fighting for the right to a decent life for all working families. The stakes are higher than ever. We can’t afford another four years of this. We need a change. Every single frontline worker should have the personal protective equipment that they need to be safe. Lack of planning and willful neglect has left most of the healthcare workers at risk of contracting the virus. If Donald Trump prevails in court, insurers would be allowed once again to strip away coverage, jack up premiums, simply because of the battle they survived fighting coronavirus. No matter what my gender is, what my job is, what my race is. Everyone deserves a good quality of life. Everyone in this room should have a minimum starting at $15 an hour wage across the board. We need a union to fight for better wages. We need a union to fight for better benefits. Only one way you can fight back power is with more power, and that’s union power. We should unionize McDonald. Unions have to be on the forefront of bringing people together and changing our country. Unions are social justice organizations. Racial justice is a situation that we’ve been dealing with all our lives. We can’t leave this moment thinking that we can once again turn away and do nothing. The moment has come for our nation to deal with systemic racism. I’m coming this country in 1993 when my husband passed away. I have four children. I has to make a hard decision for better life for my kids. My life is in the finger for this administration. On day one, I’m going to stand the legislative immigration reform bill to Congress, provide a roadmap to citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants. Working people and our families need to be engaged in the civic engagement process. Something is going to happen. There’s going to be a change. A really good change. It’s going to be Joe Biden. He is for equality, fair housing, affordable healthcare. He is for the people. To me, it’s a clear choice to vote for Biden. He’s going to be the president. It’s supposed to Joe Biden. I’m going to use that same energy to get Joe Biden in for President. You’ve got to win. Hello. Welcome to the essential worker round table with Vice President Joe Biden. I’m Mary Kay Henry president of SEIU and I’m so proud to welcome you, Mr. Vice president, for the amazing work that you’ve done in making crystal clear to everyone in this nation that you see care workers and you feel their immense difference they make each and every day and yesterday you told the nation that you’re going to make care jobs the cornerstone of the next American economy. That includes all of us. And we’re so, so proud of your commitment to that and your absolute clarity about the way in which working people have power across the service sector in this country is through their union. So thank you for joining us. Thank you for that amazing Walk a Day that you just did with Shanrika. You are making history in so many ways, Mr. Vice-president. That’s a first ever for SEIU to do a virtual Walk a Day through a nursing home. Thank you and welcome. And we’ve been joined by these other essential workers that I’m proud to introduce you to, but let me just pause for a second to welcome you, Mr. Vice President. Mary Kay, it’s great to see you and all the frontline workers. You risk your lives every time you go to work and the question is how to protect y’all and to make sure you get respect that you deserve. But Mary Kay, I just can’t tell you how much I appreciate it. I’ve been the recipient of the incredible work, my family and my extended family, that all the people on this call do. And it really makes a difference. You change people’s lives. And a lot of people wouldn’t be able to live the lives they’re living now without you. They’d be in real, real trouble. Anyway, why don’t I, as my mother would say, hush up, and [crosstalk 00:31:48] whatever you want me to do next. But Mary Kay, thanks for being my friend, thanks for the support. And by the way, this is a case where not only have an opportunity to make sure we provide better care and affordable care to more and more people, particularly in that sandwich generation, those who are taking care of a mom and taking care of a child at the same time, as well as making sure that we provide more jobs, better paying jobs and more respect for the people providing that kind of care. And the consequence of all that, even the people who aren’t crazy about my ideas acknowledge that this will in fact increase economic growth and everything gets better. The economy will grow. We can employ by this program over the next four years about 5 million people, better pay people and put people back to work who in fact can’t work now because they can’t afford the care and people who can afford it, who are providing the care, they’ll be able to afford to live because they’ll get a decent wage. And now we’re going to employ more people. So there’s a lot going on here. As you heard me say before Mary Kay, and I’ll stop, my mother used to say, ” Everything terrible, Joey, something good will come if you look hard enough for it.” This is an opportunity. An opportunity for us to deal with systemic racism, systemic inequity, as well as providing a better life for an awful lot of people. Great. Thank you so much, Mr. Vice-president. We’re going to do a rapid fire round from the caregivers in the healthcare sector, home care and hospitals. Then we’re going to deal with two leaders that are confronting corporate power in fast- food and airlines. And then we want to tackle with you the anti-immigrant, anti-Black racism that’s raging in this country and what our union is doing to unite with you to end it once and for all. And then we want to wrap it up with investing in public service work at a state and local level. All right. So I’m going to introduce Suk Kim is part Of our incredible home care leadership team. Suk, welcome. I can’t hear you, Suk. Suk, we can’t hear you. The button, yes. We can’t hear you, sorry. So I’m going to move to Marlin and then come back to you, Suk. We’ll figure out the audio. Marlyn. Hi, my name is Marlyn Hoilette. I am a member of 1199 SEIU Healthcare, union workers in Florida. I’m a proud immigrant from the Island of Jamaica. I’ve been a registered nurse for 24 years. God loves you. As healthcare workers, we are the ones on the frontline every day taking care of patients. Safety is our number one issue. I believe the safety of patients, workers and families is far more important than healthcare organization’s profits. We don’t have hazard pay and we are pressured to return to work before having enough time to take care of our loved ones if they get sick. All healthcare workers should get personal and family medical leave. I lost her. … top of that, my coworkers and I contracted COVID-19 earlier this month. It was very devastating for all. Some coworkers were even hospitalized with severe symptoms of COVID-19, which was very sad. For me, I quarantined at home in my room. I took my medications on my own. My son and my husband moved downstairs and would bring food to my door. It was a very frightening experience for them, but they took the best care of me. I am a fighter, and that’s why I’m here to share my experience today and to tell the stories of my coworkers. Without saying, it goes that we need proper PPE. Here in Florida, COVID-19 is on the rise and I am worried that my coworkers and myself might not survive a second time. Our lives are literally on the line in this election. My union members and myself, including Suk, risk over lives every day we go to work. Mr. First of all, let me say to you that if there are any angels in heaven, they’re all nurses, male and female. I spent a total of seven months and three months in ICU. I watched them take care of my son who was dying of a glioblastoma for 14 months. I watched them when my wife and daughter were killed, bring my boys back because they were in the same automobile when the tractor-trailer hit them. And as I said earlier, doctors let you live, nurses make you want to live. You have that special thing. You give hope, the mere fact that you’re there. You guys don’t even, I think, sometimes realize it. You lie there and you look at that screen in the ICU and you know if the line goes flat, you’re gone. But you don’t care after a while. You don’t really care, even if you’re not in pain, you just get tired of it. And I had nurses at Walter Reed hospital who would bend down and whisper in my year. Wow. And go home and get me pillows. (Silence) …sure you and your coworkers and others get paid and people are able to go back to work. That family you’re helping out. If you didn’t show up, they wouldn’t be able to go to work. And so you’re going to put them back to work, but we’re going to also put a lot more care workers to work. We’re going to bring more people in with you to make sure that you are able to continue to provide the services that in many cases are life and death for people. It’s gigantic what you’re doing. And so don’t ever run yourself down based on you’re from South Korea or anywhere else. Let me tell you something, the reason were so strong as an ancient because we are a nation of immigrants. That’s why we are strong. No, I really mean it. I’m not just trying to be nice. It’s the God’s truth, because what people don’t understand, as I said once to a world leader, the reason why we do so well is we’re the most unique nation in the world. As a nation of immigrants, we’ve been able to pick the best from every single culture, it took courage 40 years ago for your family to pick up and move. It took courage for my great grandfather to get on a coffin ship in the Irish sea to come to the United States of America. It took courage, optimism, determination. That’s why we’re who we are. So don’t let anybody convince you, you are not American in every single way. It’s an idea. We’re an idea. It’s not based on an ethnicity or race. I’m sorry to get so worked up about it, but it makes me so angry when I find that people based on the color of their skin or their national origin are somehow viewed in a different way. And look what he’s doing now. He’s blaming everything on China. He’s blaming everything on the Chinese. He blaming everything, and people don’t make a distinction as you well know, from a South Korean and someone from Beijing, they make no distinction. It’s Asian.And he’s just using it as a wedge. If he had moved, when he should have moved. When we knew about this, Columbia School of… In New York pointed out, there’d be 57,000 more people alive today if we moved just two weeks earlier, he’s trying to shift the blame. And we love it when you get angry Mr. Vice President, and Suk is as angry as you are. We really appreciate your passion. Really. You know, I mean this. I know you do. I know you do. [crosstalk 00:49:25] …for your amazing leadership from SEIU 2015, and now I’m going to turn to Adriana Alvarez a movement leader in the global fight for 15, and a union. Adriana is from Illinois, Mr. Vice president. And she wants to tell you her story. Thank you, Mary Kay. Hello, Vice President. I’m good. Like she said my name is Adriana Alvarez. I’m a crew member at McDonald’s. I’ve been there for almost nine years now. I a single mom of an eight year old boy. His name is Manny. And we’ve been struggling way before the pandemic. We live in a basement that frequently floods. I have to use sub pumps to be able to get all the water out. If there’s too much rain it’s overwhelming. I can barely afford to pay the day to day things that my son needs, or if we have to go to doctor visits I work for McDonald’s. I don’t get any kind of benefits. I’m making poverty wages. Even with this pandemic pay, it’s hard to make ends meet. And this national COVID crisis has brought on new and difficult challenges for me and my son. There’s no school I have to deal with. Who’s going to babysit him while I work. It’s just too much. And like most fast food companies McDonald’s has deemed us essential workers, but they have yet to treat us as such. My take home pay and work schedules are all over the place. We are instructed to wear masks and gloves, but our store is so small. There’s no way that we can do the six feet social distancing. And it’s just extremely risky. They’re lobbying against providing paid sick leave to its employees. McDonald’s is lobbying against paid sick leave at a time where we need it the most. And not just at my store, but a lot of these stores, it’s working mothers who are at risk for our kids’ safety because we’re in the middle of this. And our duties, we’re essential. Our work shifts are essential and I’m constantly worried about getting me myself sick or coming home and spreading it to my son. And I try not to explain it to him. He’s only eight. I want him to have a childhood. I don’t want him to worry about me. He’s already so worrisome about me. I don’t want to add to that. So no parent who works hard and plays by the rules should have to go through what McDonald’s is putting us through. We help them make billions of dollars in profit and I just don’t think it’s fair that they’re abusing us this way. And I know that Peggy knows exactly what I’m talking about and I’m going to turn it over to her so she can give us a little bit about her story. Hey, Peggy. Hi, Mr. Vice president. Thank you. My name is Peggy Vonner and I work at Bush International airport and I’ve been furloughed since March. And I am worried when I go back to work that I might catch the COVID-19 because my workplace isn’t taking it seriously because of my age and like of insurance. I know I’m at high risk and I shouldn’t have to choose between paying bills or survival in my industry that’s been taking care of the billions and bailout money. I don’t see how the industry is taking care of me or other workers. When we don’t have hazard pay or safety guidelines, we need to hold industry like mines accountable to make sure they use bail out money to directly benefit workers with health care, sustaining wages, benefits, corporates like McDonald’s, and United Airlines need to pay their fair share. Well, first of all, I’ve said from the very start I’m running to rebuild the backbone of this country, the middle class, and this time to make sure everyone comes along. Wall street didn’t build this country, the middle class did. And unions built the middle class. Unions are the ones keeping the barbarians at the gate. There used to be a basic bargain in America, working to help make a business successful, got to share in the profits. If an enterprise hit hard times, everyone took a hit up and down the line from the secretary to the CEO. Today that bargain has been broken. Now the only people of benefit when the company does well are the CEOs and the shareholders and the only people that get hurt when the company hits rough times are the workers. There was a study at the University of Massachusetts done from a 10 year study from 2003 to 2012. It’s going to get a little wonky here, but I always talk about it because it’s important to focus on. 54% of the frontline of the fortune 500 companies, profits went back to buying, they made over $2 trillion over that period of time. Okay? 54% of that went back to buying back their stock, which increased the value of the stock that was left. And that’s how CEOs get paid mostly. 37% of that went to making sure that they paid dividends to their stockholders. 9% was left for research, training, equipment, salaries, growth, it’s wrong. The people who do the work should share in the gains. This administration doesn’t believe in accountability instead of getting relief to working families and main street businesses, the president’s bumping his corporate pals to the front of the line, with all this aid that’s coming out of the Congress and bailing out big corporations that isn’t going to their employees and it’s not helping main street workers, 40% of all the additional small business money that was going out there, didn’t get to small businesses at all. The single biggest recipient of this have been hotel executives and major Trump donors. And the president has weakened safety regulations restricted over time period. And we all work as a lot better deal. Governments should not only defend workers rights to organize, but encourage collective bargaining across the board. And, look, I’ll fight for workers and union paid. Everyone should be entitled to sick leave and a minimum wage of 15 bucks an hour, not as a ceiling, but as a floor. Require employees to provide fair scheduling. You should have a saying in it. Crack down on employers who are trying to block organizing, including holding CEOs accountable for labor law violations. We got to make sure that federal contracting dollars only go to employees who support unions. We’re going to lay out a bold plan to build back better that, and that means union jobs. Let’s go back and talk about what’s happening to you in firms of, well, let me… If we’re going to revitalize this country, we got to make sure we invest in things that are going to create good union jobs. There are a few things that are going on here. Number one, McDonald’s, let’s take a look at McDonald’s I’m going on too long. And I apologize, but let me talk about McDonald’s for a second. McDonald’s making billions of dollars, but here’s the deal they’ve made you all sign non-compete contracts that you cannot go across town to try to get a job at Burger King. And maybe, and I’m not saying you could, but you get 25 cents an hour more. People who are hourly workers are required to sign non-compete, I will not go anywhere to any business, like the one I’m in, to get a raise. What the hell is that all about? It’s all about suppressing your wages. It’s unfair. They should be eliminated these noncompete agreements. Secondly, we should be able to unionize, McDonald’s not based on [inaudible 00:57:49] across the board. They should be able to utilize each of these franchises. That’s what we should be able to do. And I’m going to make sure that is able to be done under the law, and any company that tries to stop that from happening will pay a penalty and a price. You talk about what’s going on, and if you get back to work at the airline, well, if you’re a sanitation worker going in and making sure that you’re going to make sure that other people don’t get sick, we should take care of you. You should be getting a premium pay. You should be having all the equipment and needs. You have to make sure that you do not get the virus. In addition to that, we should make sure that the airlines know that they have to be part of what I’m going to guarantee happens. There’s going to be paid sick leave and family leave for every worker in America. It’s only basic, my dad used to have an expression. And I said, apologize for Mary Kay, she’s heard me, we’ve become friends for so long she heard me say it, but it was really what he’d say, because he lost the job. He never went to college. He knew what it was like, the bust his neck. And he’d said, “Joe, a job’s about a lot more than the paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, honey is going to be okay and mean it.” That’s the minimum we should be able to do. So, the reason I’m confident, I’m going to be able, if I’m president, get paid family leave and sick leave and make sure we have minimum wages that are increased, and a label to organize is two reasons. One, the American public knows you guys are the ones that have kept them safe. It’s not a joke. Not a joke. You’re the ones who have kept them safe. You’re the ones that allowed them [crosstalk 00:59:49] You really have. And the [crosstalk 00:59:50] …taken off, and they went, “Oh, my Lord, I didn’t realize this.” And they really didn’t. Wasn’t they don’t care, they didn’t think about it. When I tell people about noncompete agreements, you can’t go across town and try to get a 25 cent or a dollar raise. They go, “How can they do that?” They’re doing it to millions of workers. It’s Wrong. It’s going to end I promise you. And that’s why we’re so committed to building America back better with you, Mr. Vice President. Well, we really can’t, Mary. [crosstalk 01:00:27] I am optimistic. Yeah. I agree with you. I agree. We have three more leaders we wanted you to hear from. And then your closing remarks. …all too long. I apologize. That’s all right. We’re concerned about your time. I welcome at Ambar Arellano and Joe Prather, and then once they finished, we’ll see Helen Esposito come on. Oh, I think Helen’s joining us now. Wonderful. Hey, Helen. Oh, hi. Hello. Hello. My name is Ambar Arellano. I’m a janitor from Seattle Washington, and I’m an [inaudible 01:01:14] member of SEIU local six. And well, as a Mexican ,I’m too familiar with the type of racial hate Suk talk about earlier I’m a janitor, and my job can’t be done from home. Even in this pandemic, I have to work every day, risking my health and my family’s to keep buildings clean and safe for others. Many janitors who keep our country safe and running are immigrants. Their bosses abuse their power by using the lack of a status of the workers against them. These bosses pay workers without paper, less than minimum wage. They threaten to have the immigrants janitors deported if they speak up about safety hazards or try to organize a union for better conditions. Well, this isn’t right. Employers should not be allowed to abuse their power and influence. No working person in our country should be voiceless no matter what they look like, where they from, and what they do for a living. This is how they try to divide us against each other, the same way they try to divide immigrants and black workers in APA, and [inaudible 01:02:33] …Latino workers against each other. So, well, I’m going to hand it over to Joey. Who is going to ask you a question about that. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Hello, Mr. Vice President. My [crosstalk 01:02:47] My name is Joe Prather. I live in Ellenwood, Georgia. Right outside of Atlanta. We was taught 401 years ago that the first boatload of slaves arrived in Jamestown, Virginia. After that blacks experienced slavery, they was tortured. Some escaped. Women was raped. Some was lynched. Families were separated. And then we had the Civil War. Shortly after that slavery was abolished. It still wasn’t good for blacks. They had less assets to home ownerships, to education, social security. And years after that, we had the civil right movement. We marched, we protest. We fought for voter rights. We was attacked by dogs, beat by the police, sprayed now with fire hoses. And some of our great leaders was assassinated. Despite all of that history, black people in this country, including myself have managed not only to survive, but in many cases strive. I work at Marsha Distribution Center. There I’m a equipment operator. It’s a great union job. I’ve been there for 28 years. I also met my beautiful wife there. Also, I was able to send my daughter to college. There’s a lot I could do myself, but it’s one thing I can’t do myself. Mr. Vice president, I can’t overturn systemic racism that black Americans face every day. Mr. Biden, no one in this country will truly be free until this country is free of systemic racism. We know it’s not just a black problem. It’s an American problem. And with that being said, I have two questions to you, Mr. President, if you’re elected the next president of the United States, what would you do to set America free by ending systemic racism? And what would you do to help all of us, no matter who we are. Black, white, Brown, native born, or immigrants like my sister Ambar, here stand to fight systemic racism. Thank you so much, Mr. Vice president. Joe, that was such a powerful question. I just want to get Helen Esposito in, Mr. Then I’ll answer all three. Fabulous. Thank you. Hi, good afternoon, Vice President. It’s an honor to get to meet and speak with you. I’ve been an employee with the New York State Department of Labor since April of 1993. I started out as an inter clerk, and in 2000 I became an adjudicator or better known labor service representative. I’ve worked through several emergency situations since then. I’ve worked through 9/11, the airline recession crash following, Hurricane Sandy, two major floods in the upstate region, the recession from 2008 to 2014 and now will be instruct by COVID-19. When COVID-19 hit us, it’s 10 times worse than all of those put together. We could not have expected the enormity of the situation, nor were we prepared at all. The record number of those affected and out of work, not only here in New York, but the seven surrounding states of people who work within the state has resulted in myself and my coworkers working seven days a week for 12 hour days. As a mother and grandmother, I’m extremely worried about the economic impact COVID is having on our nation. Today, many of my colleagues across the nation of fighting layoffs and we’re all facing cuts nationwide. Prior to my going out of surgery recently, I never saw my family. I would only come home, eat, drink, sleep, get up, start all over again. Seven days a week. Sadly, my colleagues are facing many hardships at this time. We are in need of funding and other resources so that we can be prepared in case something like this reoccurs. Instead of fixing the problem, some states are just laying off people because they’re not getting the support they need from the federal government. Senator Republicans have not acted on the HEROES Act, which we are still waiting on. So far, I am lucky and not in a state where layoffs are occurring. I have been out of work at one time and I’ve never forgotten what that was. This makes me a better adjudicator when I’m helping the many people who are facing the unknowns of today and tomorrow. Those of whom we have elected placed into office need to do more. They need to make sure that people can maintain a roof over their head, food in their bellies, and a sustainable life for their children. Mr. Biden, Vice President Biden, my question to you is this. Well, each one of those questions is profound and they each… Or as we used to say, it’s an essay answer. And I could go on for an hour in each one of them, but let me start and work my way backwards here. Okay? I want to say that the work you’re doing in New York is really important. It starts off with making sure that you’re you got lucky. You got lucky and lucky that you have a governor who’s a real person, understands what’s going on. Leadership matters. It matters who’s in charge, number one. Number two, I’ve been through each of those terrible situations you’ve talked about. I was a Senator. I got elected and I was 29 years old when Dr. King was assassinated and Bobby Kennedy. 1968 I graduated and I got elected in 1972 and [inaudible 01:09:03] to take office. And so, I’ve been through each of those crises you talked about, and my deceased wife is from New York, upstate New York in the Finger Lakes region. And I went to Syracuse. So I’m familiar with your state. Here’s the point I want to make to you. When we had the financial crisis and the collapse of the economy, what the president did is he turned to me and he had me personally handle the so called Recovery Act. That required the distribution of $840 billion, almost a trillion dollars in 18 months to keep the economy from going into a depression. I handled it personally, myself, all of it. And the deal was that we knew, first of all, I knew I spent time with 157 mayors, every governor, but one, the governor from Alaska. And the vast majority of the people who were county executives and elected officials. And what we did, we were able to get out to the states and the counties and localities because each of the states, and you all know this, have to balance their budget. There’s a reason why the founders are wise enough not to require the federal government to have to balance its budget. Because in times of critical emergencies, they could step in and fill the void. So what we did, we saved as you well know in New York State millions of jobs across the nation. Teachers, firefighters, law enforcement officers, first responders across the board. State employees did not have to be laid off. And that’s why we were able to go through with virtually no lay off of employees who needed to get the job done for the rest of the country, including everything from janitorial staff in schools, the bus drivers, as well as the teachers and the principals. And so we need to pass the HEROES Act, which has money for the states to be able to sustain their ability to fight the crisis, not increase unemployment, and provide for a way forward for people. And you have the majority leader in the United States Senate, Mitch McConnell saying let them go bankrupt. Let them go bankrupt? The states? That is absolutely a stupid thing to say. And I don’t usually say those kinds of things about senators. So we have to pass the HEROES Act and we’ll get that done. I did it myself. I managed every single penny that went through that personally. And we had overseers. We had inspectors general that I met with once every two weeks as to make sure I could account for where every dollar went. What’s this president done? He’s fired every inspector general. We have no notion where the money’s going, except we know it’s not getting the people that deserve it. So that’s for number one. And getting the states and cities the essential money they need is critical. The pandemic slammed the states and we know what’s going on. With regard to Joe’s question, and Joe, you talked about an awful lot. Right now, we’re all in mourning because John Lewis was the moral compass, has always knew where it pointed and which direction to march. His life reminds us that the most powerful symbol of what it means to be an American is what we do with the time we have to make a promise of our nation real. And there’s so much work to be done. Our country is really in an anguish and anger over the systemic racism that still infects every part of our society. Brown, black, the whole communities of color bearing the brunt of every day of today’s crisis, just as they have from the time, as you said, Joe, from 400 years past. This has to be a wake up call for our nation, a call to action. It’s long past time for us to fully confront systemic racism and our growing economic inequity, to deal with the denial of our nation’s promise for so many, for so long. So as president, I’m going to fight every day to lead some of those changes and I’m going to listen. I laid out an initial steps that Congress should be taken immediately to deal with police reform, to hold all police to a high standard, because most of them meet the standard. Those who don’t should be held accountable. I’m going to invest in shifting our criminal focus from incarceration to prevention, ending cash bail, diverting drug offenders to rehabilitation. I set up drug courts. That’s where they should be going to mandatory rehab instead of going into prison. We need to do a lot more. We need a lot more than police and criminal justice reform if we’re going to address the systemic racism to help level out these inequities. I’m going to fight to end the deadly health inequities that COVID has amplified. Expand Obamacare with a public health option, meaning a Medicare option for the fastest path to universal care. I’m going to double the funding for community health care centers and the vital frontline workers. I’m going to make all coronavirus treatment and vaccines free for everyone. It’s necessary. We’re going to fight to give every child the same strong start in life. I’m going to make sure that Title I schools, the poor school districts, provide pre-K for everybody. You close the gap between rich and poor schools by tripling that funding from $15 to $45 billion a year. Make public colleges free for any family earning less than $125,000 a year. Modernize our broken immigration system. I’m going to send legislation on immigration reform to Congress on day one, providing a roadmap to citizens for the 11 million undocumented folks we have in this country that make our community so much stronger. I’m going to keep families together. That’s the essence of my whole notion, dealing with… You’re trying to tell me I’m supposed to stop, but I have more to say here. Above all, any lasting change has to include genuine economic justice. And until we close the racial wealth and income gaps, we’re never going to realize our promises as a nation. Unions are the key to supporting better wages, benefits, and working conditions. [inaudible 01:15:29]. They really are. Let me remind you why Dr. King was in Memphis on the day he was assassinated. He was there to stand with sanitation workers. That’s why he was there. People forget it. It’s about their dignity. It’s about who they were as human beings. I got the Dr. King award. I went to Memphis to his room. It’s exactly like it was the day he got shot. Exactly the same coffee cups, everything. He was an incredible man. He fought for economic justice. A fight for worker power and a fight for racial equality is all one fight. That’s right. I’m not only going to defend workers’ rights to organize. I’m going to encourage collective bargaining. As I said, I’ll ban right to work laws, get rid of noncompete agreements, fight for equal pay and sick leave and overtime pay. Boost the minimum wage to $15 an hour, benefiting workers. There’s so much we can do. And we finally have the public with us. Mary Kay’s heard me say this. I was up in Massachusetts and I was with… the ShopRite was trying to reduce the pay in healthcare after they made $4 billion, their parent company for the union. And I wanted to ask them to go up there and speak. And so I spoke, I’m standing there and there’s about 600 to 800 people in the parking lot of this place. And I found out that somewhere between 70% to 80% weren’t union members, they were hourly workers who realize the only reason they have the rights they have is because of unions. So it’s a different thing. Chambers of commerce have been working and make unions the boogeyman for everybody. And we actually had hourly workers that then support us. Now they understand the circumstance has changed. It’s changed. So we’re going to be in a position to fundamentally change the ability of people to be able to make a decent wage, to be treated with dignity. It’s a beginning. Then the last thing I’ll point out is that we desperately need to increase the opportunity for black folks and brown folks and Asians, the AAPI folks to be able to be entrepreneurs themselves. It to be that they thought they couldn’t do as well. All the data shows they are just as good as entrepreneurs as anyone else. But guess what? They can’t get the loans. So I’m going to double the amount of money, state and local, small businesses have to provide entrepreneurial loans to people. And I’m bringing billions of dollars off the sidelines. Secondly, we’re going to make sure that you think about this, how we work it. We have a circumstance where Joe, if you and I buy the same home built by the same builder in two different neighbors at either side of the highway, with exact same home, exact same lot. We both move in. The day we move in, if you live in a predominantly black neighborhood and I live in a predominantly white neighborhood, my home is valued at 23% higher than your home. Same exact home, same material, same everything. If in fact black homes were valued at the same price that white homes of similar nature were valued because they’re not in black neighborhoods, it would increase by $158 billion the wealth in the pocket of African American families. Just to give you an example. We have to make sure that there’s access. That’s why I think every new homeowner in these times should get a $15,000 tax credit. A $15,000 tax credit, which is a down payment to be able to go out and buy a home. That’s how we’re going to increase hundreds of millions of dollars in rental housing that’s available to people. No one should pay more than 30% of their income for housing. But point of all this is I’m not just spending the money. All the economic experts point out how much money that pours back into the economy, how much more money that provides for people, how it grows the gross domestic product, how we all benefit. It’s time we start thinking wisely and you can’t do it unless we bring along everybody. Look, I just want to say thanks. And Mary Kay, as you know I get awfully passionate about a lot of this, but this is in our wheel house. We can do this, but folks, it’s not just enough to elect me president. You got to go out and up and down the ticket. We got to elect a democratic Senate. We got increased the number of members of the House of Representatives for Democrats. We’re going to need the help. It matters who your mayor is. It matters who your county executive is. It matters who your local officials. As John Lewis, who was a friend of mine, said, “The most powerful tool we have is to vote.” To vote, to vote, to vote. I want to thank Mary Kay and the union for the endorsement you gave me. But I also want to strongly encourage you. This is a chance in a lifetime we have here. It would be called an inflection point, particularly on race. Back when I was a kid in high school, Will Connor and his dogs would [inaudible 01:21:06] those lovely elderly ladies going to church in their Sunday best dress with little kids. And he [inaudible 01:21:14] their dogs on them and fire hoses, ripping the skin off of them. You know what happened? What happened was the rest of the country who didn’t have black populations heard this happened. All of a sudden, they saw it on black and white TV screens. And you know what Dr. King said? They thought Will Connor and the segregation [inaudible 01:21:33] putting a wooden stake in the heart of the Civil Right Movement. And he pointed out, they generated the second emancipation, the Voting Rights Act, the Civil Rights Act. It passed because people said, oh my God, it really happens. I don’t have my cell phone on me, but that cell phone, with millions all across America, were not for that 15 or 16 year old kid who for eight minutes and 46 seconds taped what happened to George Floyd, people didn’t believe it. They didn’t think those things really happened, but now they saw it. They saw it clearly. They saw his nose pressed up against that curb. How many times he said, “I can’t breathe.” How many times he called for his mama. His mama. And they saw it, and now they’re tired. You have 78% of white folks out there saying that black lives matter. Black lives matter. I had a neighbor who’s a Republican, not across the little pond I live on, and put up a sign on their property so I could see it. Black lives matter. This is a time to take advantage of what we have. Let’s not miss it, but you got to vote. You’ve got to vote. We agree with you, Mr. Vice President. This is our time. We are committed to build back better with you and end systemic racism in America once and for all, and to check corporate power by building union power. So we look forward to doing that with you. Thank you for seeing caregivers. Thank you for seeing and hearing each of our stories. And we are going to go get our texting, our phoning, our virtual turnout, and show up and vote in numbers like never before. Thank you so much for listening to us today. Well, thanks so much [inaudible 01:23:32]. Thanks to Amber and to Marlin and [inaudible 01:23:34] and Joe and Helen and Adrianna and Peggy, thank you so much for your leadership on behalf of millions of servicing care workers. Well, let me tell you something [crosstalk 01:23:45]. Last comment I’ll make. If every hedge fund manager quit tomorrow, we’d still survive. If all of a sudden, every single person in your union went on strike, America could not survive. No, I’m not joking. That’s true. If everybody in the IBW decided they’re not going to work tomorrow, guess what? And by the way, you were talking about when your basement floods and because you’re home with your kid, that kind of thing. Well, make sure you do something that I bet you haven’t done. Remember, when that person out there clearing out that sewer to keep your basement flood more, go say thank you. Thank them. Of course. Think about it. We don’t thank people enough. Even those of us and even those of you were working like hell. Think about how many times we don’t thank people. It matters. It matters. Always thank. Thank all of you. Appreciate it. Mary Kay. I love you. Thanks. Love you, Mr. Vice President. Thank you. Thanks to all of our incredible leaders. Thank you for your leadership. Thanks."
"91","07-28-20"," Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Kingswood Community Center. Actually, that’s the one down I used to work as a joke. I didn’t know where you were. Anyway, it’s great to be here and back at a place where, I want to thank Wayne Jefferson for having us here at the Hicks Anderson Center. [inaudible 00:01:42] from Delaware, everybody knew who Hicks was. He was deeply involved in social justice issues and politics in the state for a long time and was really very much engaged back in the days when, after Dr. King Was assassinated and this city was in flames. And he was a good friend, a good friend. And I want to thank him for us. I used to work over the East side and I got to know Hicks very well because he did a lot of work over there as well. And you know, folks here at this center, as Wayne will tell you, doing God’s work. This community center gives people hope and a place to belong. I saw hope as a Senator, when, as I said, I watched my son, the Attorney General of Delaware, Beau Biden. He would attend mass at Sacred Heart, just up the street here. And then he’d walk here with his notebook in hand, pocket, sit around for the better part of the day and see if he could find ways to help and see what they may need or not need. And it was on the, as I said, the East side where I was a teenage lifeguard and my career as a public defender started. That’s why I got so involved with the community. And this center, as I said, is named after my buddy Hicks Anderson, he was everybody’s friend. Hicks and I went way, way back. Just walk around Wilmington and everyone, everyone has a story about Hicks. How he cared, how he always was there for you and how he built a wonderful family, including twin sons who gave back so much to this community and continue to do. They served in the United States army, and now they’re serving jointly as the Poet Laureates of the State of Delaware and Nnamdi is a state representative. And Hicks and his family, and everyone else at the center embodied the defining story of America. For generations, Americans who were Black, Brown, Native American, immigrant, have always been found, they pushed out, not fully included from our democracy and our economy. And it’s by pure courage, heart, and grit, they never gave up as they pursued the full promise of America. That’s the story of the people of this community and of this country. That’s why I couldn’t think of a more meaningful place to talk about my Build Back Better economic agenda. A bold, practical plan that’s going to help build a stronger and a more just and sustainable economy for everybody. Everybody, this time included. And it’s the story of two civil rights heroes we lost last week. One who showed us the way forward. Each of them, their separate ways. Reverend C. T. Vivian, who faced down drownings, beatings, and his comment was, “You can’t turn your back upon the idea of justice.” Enormous courage, and my friend, an American hero, Congressman John Lewis, who crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge one last time on Sunday, once said, “Freedom is not a state. It’s an act.” I went over the bridge twice, once with him and I thought I knew a lot about it. Until you walk that bridge, and some of you have done it, and you get to the crest of the bridge. The first time you can see down the other side. And I walked over with him a couple of years ago. I thought to myself, “What in God’s name did it take in terms of internal fortitude, courage to walk down there, seeing those folks with clubs and on horses, waiting at the bottom of the bridge with no way back. I spoke to John just before he died. He was on his death bed and they said he could talk, he wanted to talk. Instead of answering my concerns for him, he asked about me. He asked about us. He asked that we stay focused on the work left undone to heal this nation. To remain undaunted by the public health crisis and the economic crisis, taking the blinders off in this crisis and showed the systemic racism for what it is, that plagues this nation. People have seen now, most people allowed them to shelter in place. All those folks risking their lives, stacking the shelves in the supermarkets, farming the food, getting it to our tables. All those folks, most of whom are Black and Brown. One thing the Senate and the President can do right away is pass the bill to restore the Voting Rights Act. Just yesterday, it was renamed in the Congress in memory of John Lewis. Back the effusive praise we heard since he passed, especially from many of our Republican friends. Back it with some action, protect that sacred right to vote that he was willing to die for. If they don’t, I’ve been saying all along, it’s one of the first things I’ll do as president if elected. We can’t let the fundamental right to vote be denied, especially in the middle, as this pandemic rages on. Nearly 150,000 dead from COVID-19 and counting. More than 4 million Americans have tested positive and counting. Black and Latinos are three times as likely to be infected and twice as likely to die from the virus as white people. More than 30 million and counting are collecting unemployment checks. Black unemployment is at 15%, Latino, 14.5. 40% of black owned businesses, 440,000 in total, have reported they had to shut down and everything is worsened by this crisis of presidential leadership. To change the tone over the last few days, as Trump has, doesn’t change the facts of the last four years. Donald Trump faces a real test, and he’s failed it. The basic threshold of being president, the duty to care for the entire country, not just as re-election prospects. He’s shown that he can’t beat the pandemic and keep you safe. He can’t turn the economy around and get America back to work. And he is horrifyingly and not surprisingly, intentionally stoking the flames of division and racism in this country. I said from the outset of the recent protests, that there’s no place for violence or destruction of property. Peaceful protesters should be protected and arsonists and anarchists should be prosecuted. And local law enforcement can do that. When President Obama and I were in office, we protected federal property. We were able to do it without the Department of Homeland Security turning into a private militia, and it can be done today, but that wouldn’t help trump’s political interest. He’s determined to stoke division and chaos. It’s not good for the country. Donald Trump doesn’t care. His campaign is failing and he’s looking for a political lifeline. This isn’t about law and order. It’s about a political strategy to revive a failing campaign. Every instinct Trump has is to add fuel to the fire. It’s the last thing, the last thing we need. We need leadership. We’ll calm the waters and lower the temperature. That’s how we restore peace in the streets. But this election is not just about voting against Donald Trump. It’s about rising through this moment of crisis. Understanding people’s struggles, and building future worthy of their courage and their ambition to overcome. Last month, I stopped at Bethel AME Church here in Wilmington, not far from here. I talked to a group of faith and local leaders. They shared their pain, their anger and the frustration at the state of affairs. State of affairs in our justice system, our healthcare system, our politics our economy. There’s just a sense, and it’s real, that the deck is stacked, stacked against the community. The common theme was, how do we break the cycle? In good times, communities of color still lag. In bad times, they get hit first and the hardest, and in recovery, they take the longest to bounce back. This is about justice. I proposed the criminal justice reform and policing reform agenda, and I’m committed to working with the Congress to see it through as president. It’s also about jobs, good paying jobs. Financial stability, building wealth for families of color and passing it down to their kids. It’s about economic growth for our country and out performing the rest of the world to stay ahead. It’s also about dignity, for working people in the middle class. Many of you heard me say it before, my dad had an expression. He said, “Joey a job’s about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in the community.” He’d end by saying, “It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, honey, it’s going to be okay, and mean it.” Over 50% of the people in America don’t think it’s going to be okay for their kids, that they’ll never meet the standard of living they had. Over the last few weeks, I’ve laid out my Build Back Better plan based on necessities, and on the idea, we can’t just build back to what it was before, we have to build back better. This time, bring everybody along. We need to make bold, practical investments to recover from the economic mess we’re in and to rebuild the economic future our country deserves. I’ve explained how these investments would be paid for. I’ve laid it out. Today, I’m here to explain how the Build Back Better plan will deal with systemic racism and advance racial equity in our economy. So far, the Build Back Better plan has had three parts I’ve spoken to. First, investing in American manufacturing and technology. So the future is made in America and it includes all Americans, not just the seven cities the vast majority of venture capital has gone to. Under my plan, we will mobilize the biggest investment in rebuilding our country since World War II, creating millions of good paying union jobs. It includes a historic investment in federal procurement, which is the way government purchases goods and services. Under my proposal, we’d make sure those goods and services are American made in American supply chains, like American steel for building, and energy efficient vehicles, and battery technology and so on. But for too long, federal contracting for this work has been inaccessible to too many Black and Brown entrepreneurs and businesses. They too often never get a fair shot to apply. My plan makes sure the contractors and subcontractors of color get a fair shot. We’re going to triple the existing federal goal for contracting small disadvantaged businesses from 5% to a minimum of 15% by 2025. We’ll create jobs and growth along the way. We can do that. The second plank in Build Back Better advances racial equity by mobilizing our infrastructure and taking on climate change with jobs. Take infrastructure for example. In too many underserved communities of color, the roads are falling apart. Street lights are out. Sidewalks are cracked. School buildings outdated and unsafe. Parks aren’t safe for the kids to play in or adults to exercise in. There’s nowhere you can go to buy fresh food for miles away. Air pollution causes childhood asthma that follows them through their adult life and affects their overall health condition. Abandoned homes crush property values, and diminish the quality of life in the neighborhood. … property values, and diminish the quality of life in the neighborhoods, they exist. But not withstanding these systematic barriers, look at the energy, pride and achievement of communities of color. Just imagine if we could truly unleash their full potential. My Build Back Better plan would make sure families and these communities are the ones who benefit from the hundreds of billions of dollars in federal investment, tax payer dollars that have already have to be invested by the administration in purchasing things. To rebuild roads, fill those cracks in the sidewalks, instill broadband, close the digital divide, create spaces to live and work and play safely where you can drink clean water, breathe clean air, and shop at a nearby grocery store with a fresh stock of healthy food. We can’t rebuild our economy and meet this climate crisis unless we create opportunities for people to build their own communities. This is about jobs. It’s also about dignity. It’s about pride. I’m confident we can do this. The third plank of my Build Back Better investment is in caregivers who take care of our loved ones and our kids. We truly want to reward the work in this country. We have to ease the financial burdens of care that families are carrying. We have to elevate the compassion, benefits and dignity of caregiver workers and early childhood educators. Families are squeezed emotionally and financially trying to raise their kids, care for their parents and loved ones, live with a disability. My guess is that some of you have been through that; the parent who’s ill and can’t take care of themself, you have to make the choice of going to work or staying home and take care of them because the cost is so incredible. Or young child under the age of five, figuring how you pay for it. I was a single parent for five years with a lot of help. And I had a good salary. I was making $42,000 a year… without my family I couldn’t have done it. They need help, but often they can’t afford it. And the professional caregivers out there, the home health workers, childcare workers, who are often women, women of color and immigrants, are too often underpaid, under seen, and undervalued. But these are the things we can do right now to ease the burden. My plan would clear the waiting list that exists now of 800,000 people who are eligible for home and community care for a loved one through Medicaid who signed up, but are waiting; 800,000. My plan would make sure every three and four year old child gets access to free high quality preschool like students have at this center, while I do with title one schools. And low and middle income families won’t spend more than 7% of their income on childcare for children under the age of five. The most hard-pressed working families won’t have to spend a dime because it will be free. My plan would pay and support our caregivers who overwhelmingly, as I said, are women of color. This plan to help workers, especially those without college degrees, gain new skills in good paying industries like healthcare, and provides a pathway to advance their careers. For example, a home healthcare worker under this plan will have access to training you need to become an EMT, or a nurse, or physician’s assistant. We won’t just putting millions of Americans to work in new care and early childhood education jobs, we’ll also free up millions more to rejoin the paid workforce. Studies indicate at least 2 million additional jobs will be created; more economic growth for our nation. And the economy as a whole will grow. We can do this. Today I’m laying out a fourth part of my Build Back Better plan advancing racial equity across the American economy, not just part of the other pillar of Build Back Better, but this is in its own right. To start we create a new small business opportunity fund. It dramatically expands on the successful Obama-Biden initiative that generated more than 5 billion and $5 in private equity for every $1 in public investment in a small business, particularly in hard-pressed areas. We’re going to take $30 billion of our Made in American Investment, I announced earlier this year, and put it into this fund. We’ll allow the expanded federal support for the most effective state, local, and nonprofit programs to provide venture capital and financing for minority business owners and communities in need. It will also allow us to support community development banks that have a proven record of investing in minority small businesses. That 30 billion is estimated to leverage 150 billion in new financing and equity for more black and brown small businesses. So our Small Business Opportunity Fund supports and investment in a small manufacturer of color seeking to commercialize a new technology for example. That helps the manufacturer get started. Then private investors, we know, notice the promise of that business and invest their private dollars as well. That helps manufacturers scale and grow. That’s how we’ll make sure that those are the best ideas are not denied the venture capital or financing they need because of race or zip code. And here’s why it matters. Right now we’re in the midst of one of the greatest threats to small businesses our country has ever seen. What Donald Trump doing about it? Well, he’s given big banks the green light to loan millions of dollars that they’re covered for by the federal government, and make millions of dollars in fees by favoring their most well-off and well-connected clients while shutting the door on smaller, black and brown business without these connections. You all remember, some of you covered when I first laid out what I thought needed to be done in the first recovery plan put forward by the Congress, I said, we should use, the president should use the authority he has under the Defense Production Act to force big banks to have to lend to small businesses. They’re guaranteed the loan. “Do you have a credit card with us? Have you established credit with us? Do you have a bank account with us? Do you…” and the list goes on. And they’re denied. The result? Billions of dollars in COVID relief programs for small businesses benefit ones who had lawyers and accountants to help them better connect to businesses, jumped to the head of the line, and the big banks accommodated. Black and brown small businesses that needed the help most got shut out. In fact, just 12%, 12% of black and brown businesses surveyed seeking help, got the aid they asked for. Now half of them say they’re going to have to close up shop. And they’re a major source of employment in America. Our economy can’t afford for them to close; their families can’t afford for them to close. Under my plan 50% of emergency small business relief would be reserved for the smallest businesses of 50 or fewer employers. Right now we’re talking 500. They are small business compared to the Fortune 500, but do you think most people think the neighborhood stores have 500 employees are small business? Right down the main streets, so many small towns around America and big towns, and see them shuttered. This would help minority-owned business get lifesaving loans before the well-connected businesses jumped to the head of the line. And removing the barriers for black and brown entrepreneurs to start and grow businesses is only one of many things we have to do to close the racial wealth gap in this nation. Expanding black and brown home ownership is another. Today american cities, there are a number, where about 75% of white Americans own their homes, only 25% are black and brown citizens, or black citizens own their homes. Even in the middle class communities of color, the same homes that exist in the white community are often valued significantly less. Those black residents then see their wealth accumulate much more slowly. Many of you are from families like mine, middle class families. Where do we accumulate, where did my parents accumulate any ability to borrow and generate any wealth? In their home. That’s how it got built. That’s a lot of us were about to send our kids to school, borrow against that. When a house is an asset that helps build equity and wealth, the home ownership disparity denies equal opportunity. My housing plan is going to be a major contributor. From a $15,000 first time home buyer tax credit, which means they know once the deal is through they will get paid the down payment, expanding affordable housing… it’s reversing Trump’s efforts to gut fair housing enforcement. He’s now trying to scare the hell out of suburbs saying these rules that Biden and the president put through are going to be, they’re causing you to end up by implication of having those black neighbors next to you. That’s supposed to scare people. We’ll remove the barriers to home ownership that hold back too many Americans of color from a pathway to middle class. We’re also going to have to remove another piece of systemic barrier for too many black and brown Americans. What’s holding back too many people of color from finding a good job and starting a business is a criminal record and follows them every step of the way. Getting caught for smoking marijuana when you’re young, surely shouldn’t deny you the rest of your life being able to have a good paying job, or a career, or a loan, or the ability to rent an apartment. But right now that criminal record is the weight that holds back too many people of color, and many whites as well. The process to seal or expunge those records can be complicated and costly in the states where the records are kept; and life of a second chance passes by. Now some safeguards are necessary, but some do more harm than good. And the more and more states that recognize the significant costs to their economy when people with certain non-violent criminal records can’t fully contribute to their full talents and capacity. But even when the states want to give that person a second chance and seal or expunge a certain non-violent criminal record, the record keeping systems are so outdated they don’t know how to do it. It’s paper spread across different courthouses. Under my plan, if a state decides it wants to implement an automated system for the sealing and expungement of certain non-violent criminal records, if the state chooses to do that, the federal government will help put together the process and allow them the money to be able to know how to organize to do that; organize their system. That’s what racial equity in our economy looks like. Here’s another step we’re going to take under my Build Back Better plan to fully include more people into the deal. We’re going to strengthen the Federal Reserves’ focus on racial economic equity. The Fed has a profound impact on our economy. Most people wouldn’t even think the Fed has anything to do with this. It’s existing mandate promotes maximum employment, and stable prices. Under my plan, I believe the Fed should add to that responsibility, and aggressively target persistent racial gaps in jobs, wages, and wealth, revise its hiring and employment practices and achieve greater diversity at all levels of that institution, including diverse nominees for the board of governors, and the regional federal banks. So when the chairman of the Federal Reserve provides report on the health of our economy, we’ll know if the economy is helping everybody. That’s when racial equity is not just an aspiration, but a theory of change, how to build our economic future to include everyone, include all those remarkable people out there doing extraordinary things given just half a chance. I met a couple, they’re in here somewhere. [ Markivas 00:14:32], where are you? See that young man right there? I hope I’m not embarrassing you, and his lovely wife. Markivas, who I just met backstage, his mom and dad never went to college, and he was 12 when someone handed him an old laptop computer. He took it apart, put it back together. It changed his life. At 17, he got certified to become an IT system specialist. He went to college, studied abroad, came back home, seeing the digital divide in his community, and he started a business getting computers to folks. He’s now 22, married with a little baby, and expecting another. And he has seven employees. His goal is to teach people how to repair and recycle computers and create a workforce development program to get them trained for good paying IT jobs. Pretty incredible. He’s incredible. Some of the people he helped only had eighth grade educations, never used a computer before… five weeks later they know how. Some are now earning $15 an hour for their first job, and for the first time. They’re incredible. He wants to scale up this business, and continue the reinvesting in his community. … in his community. That’s pure courage, heart and gut. He never gives up the pursuit of the full promise of America. That’s who we are. That’s what this election is all about. We are America. We don’t settle. We aspire and we succeed. I’ll be happy to take your questions. Let me get my list here. Okay. Jessica. Mr. Vice President, I want to talk a little bit about your VP pick. We’re narrowing in on the timeframe that you had identified as when you would make your announcement. I’m going to try to figure out how to trick you all so I can meet with them in person. You got crews outside my house. I don’t think it mattered. What I said was that I’m going to have a choice in the first week in August, and I promise I’ll let you know when I do. We’ll see. You’re going to have to wear masks. We would have to wear a masks. I’m not prepared to say much more. Okay. Thank you. All right. I’m supposed to call and people, right? Okay. Mary Bruce, ABC. Well, I’m not going to comment at every state, but any state where the rate is more than one to one here should be in fact rolling back. Look, from the beginning of my view, the President has given us a false choice. He said that we have to get back to work and also deal with COVID. You can’t get this country going again unless you get COVID under control. And so he has been really late in the game to getting around himself wearing a mask, for example. We waited for he, as you’ve heard it a hundred times, the Columbia Studies showing that if he’d acted just one week earlier, it would be, I think it was 37,000, wasn’t it? 31,000 more people alive. Two weeks earlier, 57,000 or whatever. The point is that there’s no clear message. There’s a federal responsibility to lay out really clear guidelines. It’s like opening up our schools. What’s happening now is there’s a national … We need the CDC. They had very strict guidelines they were going to do at first. They’ve watered those down in my view, what I’ve seen. Was talking to the docs that I deal with about three times a week and give me an hour and a half an hour and 50 minute brief. And so I think that what’s happening now is even in the States where it’s about freedom, freedom versus physical safety of your neighbor and communication of the virus, even in those states, they’re now locking down. And they’re locking down counties which have high returns on testing. The president says his answer was we’ll stop testing so we’re not going to know. Okay? We don’t know who has the virus. I think it’s really important. And here it takes me into what the next stage of this is. As you know, I know you’ve covered this a lot, I called a long time ago, meaning several months, that we should be putting together right now, and we should be providing about $25 billion to do it, to make sure that we have a detailed plan once a vaccine is in fact found, God willing sooner than later, to be able to be distributed to all America and anything beyond that. And it’s really a difficult logistical thing to do. Where is the planning to do that? We said the same thing about testing and tracing. We still don’t have enough tests. We still don’t have the capacity to trace. And so really, really I pray the president in fact takes advantage of a prospect of getting a vaccine just before, just after the first of the year, so we’re able to distribute it and do it in a way that deals with every part of America. But there’s been no planning that I can see. No, I have not. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Greg Anderson, Delaware State News. You’ve had these meetings in Delaware the last three weeks. I’m just curious why Delaware, to be here, making these announcements. I’m home. This is my home and making this announcement in terms of whether I did this announcement in Seattle, Washington, or in New Mexico wouldn’t matter. It gets the same coverage, no matter where it is. And it was just a lot easier to be able to communicate with staff, work with staff that’s in Philadelphia and the like to get this all lined up. And what I found is operating out of home, all this stuff about hiding in the basement, well, over 340 million people have watched what we’ve done like this on television. That’s as big as the American population. So I’m learning that the way people are viewing the news and absorbing the news these days is totally different than it was before. So I find it really doesn’t make a whole lot of difference where you do it from as long as we can do it safely. And secondly, the reason I wanted to do this is because of Hicks Anderson. I can think of no more … If I were in Washington at the time, I’d come here for dealing with this issue because of my buddy, Hicks, and what has been done and what he was all about. It’s a Delaware thing, as you probably know. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, Mike. Thank you, sir. You just said that you believe that the president is intentionally provoking some of these violent clashes we’re seeing, particularly in Portland. I’m sorry. Helps to be a little taller, I suppose. No, no, I didn’t mean that. You just said that you believe the president is intentionally provoking some of the violence we’ve seen in these clashes in Portland specifically. But as you might know, the president in his tweets and his campaign and the television ads they’re running is warning that if you’re president, we would see similar scenes throughout the country. I wonder how you would respond to that. I’d be using local police as we did when we were in office. When there were riots and there were federal property at stake, we were able to take care of that. We were able to take care of it by the use of, wasn’t as wide as this obviously, the use of local police. And the fact is that arsonists should be held accountable. People carrying guns shooting should be held accountable. People who engage in criminal activity should and must be held accountable and taken to trial. But what’s happened here is this has just caused such enormous political division. And it’s all about being able to … You say some of the ads. You see cities burning, call 911 and they have my picture in the background. If it’s a rape, dial one, if it’s anything else, it’s going to take seven days. I mean, come on. That is all about trying to come up with a bizarre law and order 2020 campaign thing, just try to scare the devil out of the American people. Look, Mike, when the president decided he had to walk across from the White House through a group of peaceful demonstrators to an Episcopal church to hold a Bible upside down, which I don’t know how often he reads, and he used the military to do that, did you ever think you’d see a chairman of the joint chiefs of staff apologizing to the nation for participating in that? Did you ever think you’d see four former chiefs of staff talk about how everything’s about dividing the country? That wasn’t about being able to walk across and hold up the Bible. That wasn’t about the church burning or being burned. It was about, as his own people said, his own commander, it was about dividing the country. [inaudible 00:10:10]. When you have a president who, in almost the same day the state of Mississippi takes the Confederate flag off of their flag and he’s defending the Confederate flag, “It’s just a matter of heritage. And why isn’t it still being flown” or something to that effect at NASCAR and why things are down, this is about division. This is about trying to split the country. And so far, thank God, the American people aren’t having any of it. Over 70% of the people in the country thinking the protesters that … Did you ever think you’d see 77% of the people saying Black Lives Matter? Because they see what happens and they’re not buying onto this racial division. That’s what he’s done from the very beginning. As you’ve heard me say, coming down an escalator the day announcing, says “We’re going to get rid of those Mexican rapists and judges.” I mean, this is … So Mike, I don’t think you needed that, but I think we do need to hold those who violate the law accountable. You should never let what’s done in a march for equal rights overcome what the reason for the march is. And that’s what these folks are doing. And they should be arrested, found, arrested, and tried. Sir, if I can. You finished the rollout of your economic plan. During the course of the primaries, you were critical of some of your Democratic opponents for putting forward plans that you felt were too expensive and not realistic in terms of getting past. You’re now proposing nearly $3 trillion as part of this and spending as part of this economic plan. I think there’s a big difference between saying, figuratively speaking, no one can be a millionaire, that’s a bad thing, saying that we are going to provide a medical plan that costs $30 trillion or $32 trillion, and being able to think you can get it passed and being able to pass, in this environment, legislation that the circumstances have demonstrated is needed to solve real problems. For example, the idea that we can continue to be in a circumstance where we reward companies for government contractors who are going overseas to make their products, that we can continue to provide tax breaks for that effort. When we find we come up short with everything from reagents or nasal swabs to not being able to provide for the kinds of steel we need to do certain things in American ships and the like is totally different than that. What we’re talking about is using federal dollars that have already been appropriated to focus them on building things that make us and increase our independence so we don’t have to rely on anyone else for whether it’s cyber security and cyber information or whether or not it is steel to make the banisters on our destroyers. We in fact should be able to do that, those things that are necessary and we have the capacity to do at home, do them at home. It’s not industrial planning. It’s the things that only the United States government can do. For example, the same thing with regards to my whole plan relative to the environment. We in fact can, are the only outfit … Companies aren’t going to come along and go spend a trillion dollars on infrastructure, rebuild highways, bridges that are causing people to die when they collapse and they’re still unsafe, making sure ports are accessible and ships can get in and out and unload their cargo. The government does that. And when the government does that, the government should be in fact insisting that, using that taxpayer dollars, we are buying the product from an American manufacturer made in America. Employing American workers, getting a decent wage. And that’s not industrial policy, it’s the things the government does anyway. It’s like you’ve heard me say before, the President of the United States, when I’m president, I’m going to inherit the largest auto and truck fleet in the world owned by the taxpayers. Well, what do you think we should do? What I think we should be doing is making sure we end up owning the electrical vehicle market. So what I’m going to do is move to make sure all those vehicles become carbon neutral, building 550,000 charging stations up and down federally built highways and controlled highways, generating the kind of growth, union wages that can provide good jobs for people and bring everybody along. So it is very different than saying we’re going to go out and find another $38 trillion and get that passed in a Congress where you didn’t have the support to get it. I predict you’ll find that I get significant support, particularly if I think is going to happen. I think we’re going to take back the United States Senate. And again, we’re just spending the dollars that are already appropriated in many cases and how we spend them. Thank you, sir. Okay. Ed O’Keeffe, CBS. Thank you, sir. I’ll take this off. You alluded to this in your remarks and I bring it up because polling is bearing this out a little bit, but are you running against president Trump or for president and for Joe Biden? In other words, you alluded to this, but a lot of voters seem to think or are saying that their support hinges on the fact that you’re not the president. That’s why I’m laying out these detailed plans. Look, I’m running because Trump is the president. And I think our democracy is at stake for real. And what seems to be the case is many Americans, those who don’t like me and those who do, view me as the antithesis of Trump. And I believe that I am. And when I announced, I said I was running because I thought it was essential to restore basic decency, the soul of America. But I really meant it. Remember I got criticized early on for saying that. Now everybody’s talking about the soul of America, decency, honor, respect. The second reason I said I was running is because even back when people were talking about how well the economy was moving, I thought the middle class was still getting crushed and working class folks were hurting badly. All this talk about how happy they were. I didn’t see any numbers showing they were so happy because people were getting paid badly. Corporate america was overreaching in terms of who they felt they had an obligation to deal with at all. And thirdly, the thing I got most criticized for and understandably, was I said, “We have to unite America.” And they said, “Well, that’s just a pipe dream. You used to be able to do that, Joe, but everything’s changed.” Well, if we can’t unite America, we’re gone. We’re dead. Democracy is dead. It requires consensus. That’s not hyperbole. It requires consensus. And that’s why I used to be sometimes critical when people [inaudible 00:50:44] they say, “I’m going to by executive order due to the following.” Well, that’s Trump. He doesn’t have the authority to do half of what he’s doing by executive order. That is not democracy. And so what I hope the good news, I think is the bad news based on all the million polls have been done by your network and everybody else, is the good news is the bad news. People know me, they know me warts and all. And the reason why I’m running is because I think I have two qualities at this moment, that aren’t always the most relevant qualities needed in the president. It changes, every election is different. One is that I know a fair amount about American foreign policy. And I have relations all over the world and those who don’t like me, respect me. And those that do like me, respect me. I know how to get things done internationally. It doesn’t mean I can solve the problem, but I understand the national security and intelligence issues. That’s what I’ve done my whole life. Trump has no notion of it. None. Thank of how he talks about Putin. My God. And he talks to him privately and says he’s not going to tell you whether he raised the fact that Putin’s paying the Taliban, number one. Number two, I have been relatively good at bringing people together in the United States Congress and politically. It’s going to be a lot harder. Things have changed, a lot harder. But depending on the outcome of the election, in terms of the Senate, how its race is, it could become very much within reach because I’ll say it again, I’ve never crushed any other’s motive. I’ve never lied to a political opponent, misled them. Even when I was in the Senate and I’d say, “I need your vote in this, but I got to tell you, you vote for it, this party or constituent is going to be mad at you. I’ve never misled anybody. I don’t expect anybody to voluntarily agree to be in the second edition of Profiles of Courage. I try to recognize the limits of where they can go and still find a principle compromise. And so they are the two things that I think we very bad badly need now. And lastly, I think that not withstanding the fact, I think I have laid out the most detailed plans on the economy and on issues related to healthcare and the rest of any president in modern history. I mean, it’s awful detailed. If I’m elected and this passes, I’m going to be good to go down as the most progressive presidents in America industry. But none of the things I’m talking about are inconsistent with a free market, not inconsistent with capitalism, but they require certain safeguards. Just like that whole thing, it took a capitalist to save capitalism. Well, I think there’s a lot that we can get done and will get done. And that’s why last thing I’ll say, remember I was criticized by saying, I’m going to campaign in states for senators and house members where states that I’m not likely to be able to win because what everything shows and you know this inside out and backwards, all of you do, that when the national party doesn’t invest in areas where there is a tight race, it hurts the local officials up and down the list. And so this is, we got to build a bench here and that’s what this is about as well. So I’m hoping that people will take a look at what I’ve done, what I’m proposing, why it’s in their interest, that they move in the direction I’m suggesting. And I think that is what we’re seeing some response to. I have a quick COVID question in this regard, the Florida Marlins today announced they had to suspend their season. You curious, because I know you get briefings on how COVID should be dealt with and how society should be comporting itself in the midst of all this, what do you make of how sports leagues are starting to play again? And frankly, for that matter, what do you make of how schools are considering all this? The President is considering or has said he would withhold federal funding from states or school districts that don’t reopen. I mean, you must have thoughts on all this. I do. In the interest of time, I’ve laid out, we’ll get you a copy of my school reopening plan, what I think is required in order to do that. There’s some circumstances you can do that, but you have to make significant investments to do that, in order to provide for protective gear, in order to provide for social distancing, in order to have testing and tracing and all those things. It’s possible, but it’s a significant investment. And it requires the certainty that teachers, as well as students, are going to be protected. And where you’re in a high intensity area, where there’s a lot of COVID, it is not a good idea. Evidence, the fact that, rhetorical question, I’m not expecting you to answer it. Do you think the president all of a sudden decided not to go to Tallahassee because he no longer, he thought it was the interest of the public? I mean Jacksonville, Florida. I’m thinking of the capitol. If you go to Florida, it’s in Jacksonville. Well, because even the Republicans down there said, “We don’t want you doing this. We don’t want you to doing this.” It’s a mistake. And so I think that there are guidelines that have to be made much more specific by the CDC. They should let the scientists speak. Let the scientists speak. I’m happy the president is back holding his conferences on COVID every day. I don’t know what the hell he’s adding to it, except it’s good he’s wearing a mask and saying the right things, mostly. But this is about science. This is about science. This is about expertise. This is about transparency. And so there ought to be a system whereby and which I proposed, is that you can lay out the details of what you’re doing in your business and be able to put a sign out that says it’s safe, I’ve met all the standards. But the idea that we’re just going to say open up and people are going to show up. They’re not. They’re not. Well, it seem to me, that it’s probably not going to be what happened based on what the leagues themselves are saying. I mean, you have the Marlins saying, “We can’t do it,” so many people. So I think they should just follow the science. The one thing that seems to work a little bit, I don’t know, is basketball, where no one’s traveling. They’re all sequestered in one place. It’s like, look, all of you have families, moms, dads, et cetera. If they come from another state, you go from wherever you are to their state, well you should be quarantining before you go see them, up to 12 days. Think about it. The United States of America, you can’t travel to a whole hell of a lot of European countries. You can’t get in a plane and go there. Don’t come. You’re a danger to us. It’s because we’re not following the science. And there’s very little transparency on what’s going on. But I have confidence at the end of the day … When you have a lot of football players turning down eight, 10 million bucks a year and say, “I’m not going to take the risk of playing,” You got to listen, you got to listen. So I’m not going to apply it on every sport. But it seems to me that when you have to travel, when you have to be in hotel rooms or places that are different than you’ve been the day before, when you are in a position where you’re going into an area where there is a high concentration of the spread of COVID, all those things add up to a real problem. And we’re not going to really overcome that until we follow science and get a vaccine. But I want to say it again, I’m going to keep saying it. The president, as we speak, should be starting and should have started three months ago to put someone in charge of how specifically, like waging a war. How are you going to distribute the vaccine when it arrives, when it arrives, when it’s there? And the question of whether it’s real, when it’s there, that requires enormous transparency. You got to make all of it available to other experts across the nation, so they can look and see. So there’s consensus, this is a safe vaccine. Because already you have, what percent is American people saying if the vaccine were there tomorrow, they wouldn’t take it? And it’s not the usual anti-vaccine crowd it’s beyond that because people are losing faith in what the president says. Think about it. The words of a president matter significantly. They can, as I said before, take us to war. They can bring peace. They can rise up and cause the market to rise, they can do good things, but people listen to what a president says. And if a president repeatedly says things to you that are not true and then comes the time when they say I have something that I think can cure you, but it could really hurt you. You’re not going to listen to the guy who’s been lying you along the way. Anyway, thank you so much. Appreciate the time and I’m getting out of your hair. Thank you."
"92","07-29-20"," Joe, the UnidosUS Action Fund is proud to support you in this race and our pledge is that we will work every day, day in and day out to make you the next president of the United States. We have that power, that is going to be something that we can deliver on, and we will be very excited when that day, election day comes and we can change the course of this country and change the course of our future together. [foreign language 00:00:00:34] and Joe Biden, thank you for taking this run. Janet, madam president, thank you. We’ve been friends a long time. I love you. Thank you for your friendship and I really mean it. It’s been a real friendship, and I want to thank you for your unfailing voice for civil rights for all Americans, not just Latinos. You’ve spoken up no matter who it is. You’ve spoken no matter who it is. The leadership and the work of Unidos has been essential in standing up for the dignity to Latinos. And if I can interject one thing here, when you and I first met, we had a relatively small population and we called it at the time Hispanic population, mostly Puerto Ricans, American citizens already. But you know, in the 2020 census, which is now two censuses ago, soon to be, the largest increase in Latino population as a percent was in the state of Delaware. The state of Delaware. And you remember in the early days, I won’t go into it all because you don’t have time. But back in the days when one of the things that was going to cost me an election as a young senator was my support of the farm workers, which we were a big agricultural state. Well guess what? They’re being embraced in Delaware now. It’s not being pushed away, it’s saying, “Come. Anyway, the dignity of Latinos, the expanding access to opportunity across every part of American life is what you’ve been all about. I don’t know nearly as much as you do, but I’ve tried to learn. Our country is so much stronger for it. Let’s get something straight. The future of America, this is not an exaggeration. I know there’s a lot of press on this call. The future of America depends upon the total, full, thorough integration and acceptance and embrace of the Latino community. That’s not hyperbole. It’s real. That’s why I’m so proud and honored to have gained your endorsement in this campaign. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And your support is going to be critical. I’m going to need your help because the Latino vote is essential to winning this election and making sure that Donald Trump is a one term president. We can’t afford four more years of this president. Last year, when I spoke at your presidential forum in San Diego, it was an immediate aftermath of the horrific mass shooting in El Paso. It was an act of terrorism, white supremacists violently open firing, targeting Latinos and immigrants who were just going about their lives. It was a tragedy that shot a direct line between Trump and the crusade of his policies to unleash hate and fear against the Latino community. And the violent consequences of what can happen when we have a president who emboldens racism and embraces division. This is a president who’s, after losing in the Supreme Court, has barely skipped a beat in his efforts to punish dreamers, including … What people don’t know and I hope the press cover … dreamers make up 30,000 frontline healthcare workers. They’re saving people’s lives at the risk of their own. Young men and women who are as American as anyone, whose home is here. I always say to people when they don’t know much about the issue, and they say, “Well, what about these dreamers? Why shouldn’t they …” I said, “Look, they’re more American than most.” They said, “What do you mean?” I said, “Can you imagine you’re three years old and, ‘Mom don’t take me across the Rio Grande. I want to stay here.’ It’s a … you know.” Come on. This is bizarre. Just yesterday the administration issued another memo to rescind doc. It’s unconscionable. If I’m elected president, I’m going to take immediate action to protect dreamers and their families. I’m going to send Congress, on day one, an immigration bill that finally reforms our system and offers a roadmap to citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants enriching our community and our daily lives. They talk about how it cost the American public. The reason why the social security system has been extended for as much as it has is because of these undocumented immigrants who have jobs and are paying social security. I mean, come on. And this pandemic has taken the lives of almost 150, 000 people here in the United States. Unless the president just wakes up, which I’m worried about. I was just watching the television and I think it was a doctor representing the AMA, don’t hold me to that. But a group of doctors talking about, they think there’s going to be an incredible spike in the number of deaths, unless we take strong action now and it’s tearing through the Latino communities. It’s heartbreaking. Not only are they bearing a disproportionate impact, with the New York Times finding the Latinos have contracted COVID at three times the rate of white people. Latinos make up an inordinate percentage of those working on the front lines of the crisis. Everywhere from hospitals to meat packing plants. On top of all that, Latinos are bearing the brunt of the economic impact as well, with Latino unemployment at a staggering 14.5%. So this is about a lot more than just defeating Trump. This has to be about building back America, building it back better than it was, and our economy so that it works for everybody, including Latino families that have been shut out and punished and pushed aside for much too long. Just yesterday, I rolled out the fourth plank of my Build Back Better agenda. It’s one that focused on building on racial equality across every aspect of our economy. It’s about breaking the cycle where in good times, Latino communities still lag behind. In bad times they get hit first and the hardest, and in recovery, they take the longest to bounce back. We’re going to use every tool at our disposal if I’m elected, to rip out those inequities. That means making sure that Latino small businesses have access to the capital they need. They’re as successful as any other but they don’t have the capital or the consequence or the influence or the connections. Latino families have affordable housing and a path to home ownership is critical to build wealth. Have to ensure the people of Puerto Rico have support to rebuild their country and there’s other hurricane seasons coming. Professional caregivers, home health workers, childcare workers are often women, women of color and immigrants are treated with dignity and compensated fairly. It’s not only the right thing to do. It’s essential, essential to the very future and the economy and our country. Look, you know this better than I do. Latinos are among the fastest growing population in the United States. Already one quarter of our school children are Latino. How in God’s name can we have a strong thriving Republic if they’re not fully dealt into everything? You are the future. Not a joke. Think about it. They are the future. You heard me say it before, these aren’t somebody else’s kids, they’re our kids. They’re the kite strings that lift our national ambitions aloft. This crisis has ripped the blinder off so many people in this country for so much of the country. I have to believe we’re ready to close this respect gap, the dignity gap, the wage gap, the opportunity gap, so that so many Latino workers have suffered under it for much too long. I’m going to work like heck to win a Latino vote. I had to correct myself there, I’m sorry. So they can turn this pain into progress. So that we have the opportunity to deal in every one in the American dream. I think people are ready. The idea is that at the very heart of our campaign, and I know it’s in your hearts as well. So I want to thank you again for standing with me in this campaign. I look forward to continuing to stand with you as a partner, to pursue justice, progress in the White House. And my administration is going to look like the country, you’re all going to be represented as well. And now, I’m happy to take your questions. I want to go on and talk about a lot of things, but I’m talking too much. I’m excited about this, but I just wanted to leave with the notion. I really mean it. I am optimistic the public has had the blinders taken off. They know who is out there taking care of us and a significant portion of the Latino community. Well, thank you, Mr. Vice President. You get it, I think, and you get us. And by making sure that you’re addressing these issues that you just laid out, it will go a long way to correct the course of this country. Let me just ask you a question here. Latinos and immigrants have been deemed essential during this coronavirus pandemic and rightfully so, justifiably so. We’ve seen it. You’ve seen it. They’ve kept food on our tables and have been in public health roles and first responder roles. They have literally put their lives on the line to keep our country going, yet we’ve unfairly excluded mixed status families from receiving any type of pandemic relief. And you’ve committed, I know, to passing immigration reform for our hardworking undocumented taxpayers. Well look, let me be completely honest with you. How bad it will be by the time I’m elected, if I’m elected under the leadership of this guy. And I’m not being so wise, I’m not making a political point. I think it’s just a reality. God only knows where it will be, but it doesn’t change what I’m going to attempt to do. Where it will be, but it doesn’t change what I’m going to attempt to do and get done. We have to make sure that no one who’s hurting or qualified to receive protections during COVID is denied. Nobody, nobody. That means working with Congress to make sure that no American citizen is penalized for being part of a mixed status family. And as soon as I take office, I will use my authority one, to immediately reprioritize our enforcement resources away from terrorizing Latino families and workers on the lines in this crisis and give them peace of mind. One of the things we never talk about, I think knowing you, we haven’t talked a lot in the last little bit, but think of the damage done to the psyche of so many young Latinos when they come out of Mass wondering whether their mother’s going to be grabbed. Whether or not Mom shows up at school or Dad shows up at school. They’re going to be … they’re going to show … I mean, it’s just the anxiety. And by the way, this generation Z, I know I’m going off point a little bit here, but Generation Z as US Psychiatric Association said, is the most at risk generation for mental health and concerns, because there’s such enormous anxiety, not just among Latinos, but especially among Latino kids. So, I’m going to make sure we’re providing testing and treatment, and eventually vaccines for everyone. Every single persons, regardless of their immigration status. Regardless of their immigration status. We’re not going to beat this virus if we don’t beat it everywhere and in every community. And as for essential workers, who as you said are so often Latino, it’s incredible what they’ve done for the country. They’re fighting the deadly without the supplies, support, or basic respect for science that this government is ignoring. Our nation literally couldn’t survive without them. You know, they’ve been the lifeline. They’re the front line troops in our war against the virus. And our Commander-in-Chief, who said he’s declared war on the virus has already waved the white flag. He has a duty to get them what they need for the job. Instead of in the middle of pandemic, Donald Trump is trying to go on further gut workplace safety protections, revoke DACA protections for millions of Dreamers, 200,000 of whom are essential workers risking their lives right now in this country, repeal Obamacare and strip millions of health coverage, including millions of Latinos. And keep legal immigrants from seeking necessary medical care, securing people, scaring them away. Scaring them away from getting care. It’s un-American. They’re using this Public Charge Rule. I’m going to get rid of the Public Charge Rule on day one. And for months I’ve called for the President to make four urgent steps to protect these frontline workers. One, get all the essential workers priority access to PPE, the protective gear. Two, get free COVID testing and paid sick leave to every worker called back to work. Enforce clear work pay safety standards. Well, I just think you’re really striking a chord because our community is hurting right now. Sure it is. And it’s true from a health perspective, we’ve been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19 and the statistics just bear that out every day. We’ve been obviously twice as likely to contract the virus than everybody else. And our children as a cohort, are more likely to die from the coronavirus than any other cohort. So we’ve been disproportionately impacted yet we haven’t seen that relief. So for you to talk about and say that you’re committed to addressing that, and that you understand the systemic inequities that have led us to be so vulnerable to this pandemic, especially as a community, really speaks volumes about your understanding and knowledge. But really about what you will do, that is so meaningful to us. It’s just basic humanity. You know what I think we got to do? Got to push Congress to get all essential workers the premium pay they deserve. The premium pay. Trump has done none of it. This has to be a wake up call for the nation. A call to action. On day one I’m going to send legislation, immigration legislation reform, to the Congress to provide a roadmap to citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants that make up so much of our communities and make us so strong. I’m going to immediately take action to protect Dreamers and family. I’m going to reverse Trump’s un-American Public Charge Rule in my first hundred days. Because look, it’s just basic humanity, just basic decency. Absolutely. And you know, right now we’re working very hard to make sure that the Senate acts to move the stimulus package. Oh God. And I think they need to be accountable and as much as we’re going to work hard to elect you, we’re also going to work hard to change the Senate and the majority in the Senate. UNIDO US Action fund is very committed to doing that because we are so frustrated and outraged by the lack of commitment or any attention to addressing this pandemic and getting resources to the people who have been on the lines to deliver. And our community has not received that kind of commitment from Mitch McConnell or any of the Senate Republican leaders that we’ve seen engaged on this. Obviously we’re passing and pushing for the Heroes Act, but we want the Senate to act immediately. It’s so important that they move quickly. Our people are hurting right now. Let me ask you real quick, because all of these are related to the impact overall of the economic pressure that our people are under, our communities under right now. But like for instance, you were right about referencing an education that a quarter of our children in the United States are Latino. And I saw on your website and I’ve heard you say that our collective success depends on the success of the Latino community. Tell me or share with others what you think as president, you’ll do to close the Latino student achievement gap because our parents right now are worried that their children are losing ground. We still don’t know what’s going to happen in schools right now, but you know, a lot of our community doesn’t have full access to broadband and we don’t know if we’re going to be able to have distance learning in a way that’s allowing our community to actually learn and be safe. Oh sure. I used to have a friend who was a good friend, he’d say, “Joe, you got to know how to know. You got to know how to know.” You know, we all want our schools open this fall, but it has to really be done unsafely because you pointed out Latino children get COVID in significant numbers. Just ordering them to open like Trump has done isn’t enough. Threatening to withhold money if they don’t, is no way to deal with this either. Pushing the CDC to change it’s guidelines to suit the politics of the President, is even worse. They had much stronger guidelines. Now, if we do this wrongly, if we make a mistake, you’re going to put millions of more lives at risk and set our economy and our country back even further, particularly the Latino community. I have to do the hard work of, and we have to do the hard work of getting this virus under control, but Trump doesn’t want to do the hard work. He just wants to go to open because he’s afraid it’s hurts his reelection chances if they don’t. This isn’t about Trump’s reelection. It’s about our kids. It’s about their safety. I’s about the safety of everyone else in our schools too. The teachers, the clerks, the administrators, the janitors, and I’ve laid out a roadmap for reopening schools safely and effectively. First, you’ve got to get classes down with social distancing, mask, testing and tracing. You have to have that. Secondly, you have to give school districts, uniform guidance without political interference on safety protocols, like ventilation in the schools and the classroom changes, why you change classrooms. Thirdly, you’ve got to give districts far more resources, federal resources, to help protect because you have to provide the equipment and you have to implement that guidance. Some Republicans are offering just a watered down of what the Democrats have proposed for schools in this next round of stimulus funding. For a school that can’t reopen safely, we have to help plan and improve virtual learning and close the learning gap that COVID has widened. My wife is as you know, Jill is a professor, a teacher, taught in high school and now teaches, don’t hold me to the number, but a vast majority of her students at Northern Virginia Community College are immigrants, are foreign students and English is not their first language. But here’s the deal. She is now working like hell every night to learn how to teach by distance. I mean, teachers she’s working like hell to learn how to deal with teaching remotely. So school records show that Latino children, one in four kids of this country as you said, are disproportionately falling behind. The research suggests that some kids could lose a whole year of academic gains. We can’t let that happen. So I’m going to invest in broadband so every single one has access to it. Educators dedicated time, resource and opportunities for professional development to learn more about teaching online. Offer parents and caregivers the tools they need to be able to support this. It’s going to be hard as hell if they can’t open. And we are going to be behind. Not just Latino children, but particularly now all children. So we have to fight for educational quality far beyond COVID. That’s why you’ve heard me say I’m going to invest in children from birth and beyond school. Provide free Pre-K, meaning three and four year olds go to school, not to daycare. They go to school. So every child gets the same strong start and doesn’t by the time they get to kindergarten, be behind the eight ball. We’re going to triple funding for title one schools where so many Latino children attend because they are the poor school districts to close the gap between the rich and the poor district. Double the number of school counselors and psychologists to help kids cope with the trauma this pandemic had caused and other traumas they’re worried about. Close the college race gap. We’ve got to ease the student debt crisis, which has left Latino graduates five times more likely to default on their student loans. It’d be loan forgiveness. The bottom line, we have to listen to public health experts and follow the signs, Janet. Parents have to be able to trust their kids are safe or they’re not going to send them back. And President Trump should stop tweeting and start doing something about it, dammit, and stop going out and talking about these crazy woman he talked about last night, about who’s an absolute disgrace, saying things and tweeting that. Anyway, we just need some intelligence. Yes. Again, you’re showing you get it and that you get us, so I really appreciate that. No offense, but I happen to agree with you, Dr. Jill Biden is the best thing you’ve got going for you right now. We really appreciate her long legacy of engaging, not just in education, but understanding our community’s needs. She’s absolutely had a lot to weigh in on in terms of English learners, and we want to make sure we can continue to support them, so I really appreciate that and I appreciate her. So I hope you’ll stick with her in all of this as well. I hope she’ll stick with me. I married way up. Better said. I married way up. Everybody knows I love her more than she loves me, so I got it. I’m working like hell. Well, we love you both. Hey, listen, let me ask you about housing. Just real quick, I want to get one more question in because the economic devastation is real and we see a housing crisis looming. Latinos lost over 60% of their wealth during the last great recession and today, a majority of Latinos rent and home ownership is below 50%. We’ve actually gone backwards, significantly. What immediate actions will you take as president to prevent another foreclosure crisis and assist our community as they’re burdened by high rents and especially, as this COVID pandemic moves? Because we’re torn between being able to go to work and put our lives at risk because we don’t have access to healthcare and all the insurance or tests, or not putting food on our table. For the first time we’re seeing food insecurity, and hunger, and families concerned about putting food on table and making ends meet to pay the rent. This is a real issue, and it’s only going to intensify in the fall. Well, first of all, I hope you’ll invite me back, we can talk about food insecurity because it’s a much bigger issue. I mean, it’s a gigantic issue and it’s real. It’s real. There’s a lot of people working on it hard, but it’s real. Look, the middle class isn’t a number. It’s a value set that includes the ability to own your home or live in an apartment where it doesn’t take more than 30% of your income to live there and live in a safe community. But for too many Americans, they lack access to affordable housing. Too many neighborhoods are still divided by race and by income, homes in too many Latino neighborhoods are far undervalued, so you don’t have the wealth you’re building in that home, and 60% of the losses exist, as you point out. I fought for housing equality since my first year in government. I sought to end, when I first entered office as a County Councilman, to deal with red lining, I worked to ban discrimination lending practices that kept black families from buying homes under the Equal Opportunity Act in ’75, [inaudible 00:26:10]. I worked [inaudible 00:26:11] discrimination in housing, sales, rentals, financing, fair housing. Look what he’s doing now, the president, he’s trying to scare because an awful lot of suburbanites are now deciding they’re going to vote for me, at least the polling data suggests, as opposed to him. And he’s talking about, “Biden, what he’s going to do, he’s going to send all these folks out to suburbia. They’re going to end up with houses out in suburbian apartments in suburbian.” Even before COVID, the growing inequity and stagnant wages, and rising student debt burdens has driven home ownership rates even lower than they were in the 70s. We can’t let this pandemic make things worse in June, where in the third of renters, including nearly half Latino families, weren’t sure they can afford to meet their rent. This is an emergency, and Congress should immediately create a broad emergency housing support program modeled on the steps it takes to address natural disasters. As I’ve been saying for months, it should extend rent freezes, halt foreclosures for as long as this pandemic lasts, period. Now, it isn’t just relief that comes with recovery. I’ve made housing part of the core Build Back Better plan and for racial equity. As president, I’m going to invest literally hundreds of billions of dollars to make housing a right, not a privilege. It’s a basic right to have a roof over your head. We’re going to create a hundred billion dollar affordable housing fund to build and upgrade affordable homes that exists now, build, upgrade them. Fully fund vouchers so no family spends more than 30% of their income on rent, no family. [inaudible 00:28:03] Jim [Kleibern’s 00:28:03] legislation that gets financed, that those that are facing eviction, get legal assistance. Create a $15,000 first-time home owner tax credit, a buyer want to go buy a house, to help them make the down payment on their first house. Crack down on illegal red lining and other discriminatory lending practices. Look, this is a crisis. We have an enormous opportunity to build back better and to finally tear down the barriers that have kept far too many people from fully participating. Last point I’ll make, this is also in the overwhelming economic interest of the country. Here’s the deal, if in fact we do not provide the help now, that was in the CARES Act, as well as in what the house has passed, guess what, the whole economy is going to tank even worse. The only way to keep this thing from going even worse is so people have the money now to stay in their homes, to not have to choose between food and their rent, to be in a position where they can actually have money to go out and spend to meet their basic needs. It is the way you stimulate growth because when that doesn’t happen… And by the way, last thing, I didn’t respond and I know I’m keeping you longer than you all want, but look, Mitch McConnell talked about the unwillingness to help state local governments. You may remember, Janet, because we talked about it when we had that financial crisis we inherited, and the Recovery Act, which was… Remember, you helped me work to get three Republicans to change their view and get it passed. Yeah, yeah. Well, that was over $800 billion, I think it came up about 840, and the president asked me to do it, “Joe will do it”, and I did. But here’s the deal, I spent at least a couple hours every single day for 18 months to make sure it got out in ways that kept the economy from going to depression. But here’s the deal, if we were not able to get that money out to help from school districts, to firehouses, to counties, to cities, to the state… They all have to have balanced budgets. There’s a reason why we don’t have to have one so we can stimulate in crisis, and guess what? What’s McConnell’s phrase? A lot of these states can’t even [inaudible 00:30:36] keep their schools open financially. He says, “Let the states go bankrupt.” What a bizarre thing to say. If you are a wealthy person and you don’t care much about the things that I’ve been talking about, you should care because you’re in trouble if we don’t do these things. Well, we know you care. That has been abundantly clear and made clear over and over again, but again today, and I can’t thank you enough for your commitment to our community. Not only just to bring us all together as a country and heal us as a nation, but to actually put us on the road to economic prosperity. You get it. I know you get us. I’ll just close because I know our time is wrapping up and you’ve been so generous with your time today, but again, not surprising. I just want to close you. You talked about us remembering a year ago in El Paso, the tragedy that occurred there, and you rightly pointed out what we saw too, and that is that there was a connection between the shooter and Donald Trump’s hateful rants against Hispanics, against Latinos. One of the reasons it’s so easy for the president and his allies to continue demonizing Latinos is because I think they believe they never have to pay a political price for it. Well, it’s time for that to end. One year after that deadly shooting, Latinos and Latinas have a chance and a responsibility to force that change and to vote for someone who shares our values and vision for the future of this country, and that is Joe Biden. I couldn’t be prouder to be here today with you and to be with you every step of the way as we get to election day and to see you sworn in as president of the United States. You have that commitment from me and from the Unidos US Action Fund. I couldn’t be more excited to make sure we make that day a reality. Thank you, Mr. Vice President. That day a reality. Thank you, Mr. Vice President. Thank you, Joe Biden. Thank you Joe for knowing what is in our hearts. And one last thing, I will personally never forget you calling my sister a few years ago when my mom was suffering from Alzheimer’s. And you said, “Who’s taking care of her?” And I said, “Well, it’s my sister, Rosemary.” And the next day, you called her and encouraged her. I know yesterday you called the mayor of Long Beach, Mayor Garcia because he lost his beloved mother to COVID. We know you care, Mr. Vice President. You show it in so many different ways and that means so much to all of us. And we want to make sure that we can bring your passion and your caring spirit and your commitment to our community into the White House. So you have our commitment. Okay. You got mine as well. Look, I’ve been a recipient of so much good will and compassion the things that I’ve gone through and I know it matters. And one of the things that I think we had to keep in mind here, the battle is [inaudible 00:34:27] never won. Jon Meacham who has become a friend of mine wrote a book called The Soul of America. And he talks about how there’s a constant tug between the good and the bad in America. It’s a constant tug. And he talks about, we appeal to our better angels and then we find ourselves when things get good slipping. And I used to think you could defeat hate. I used to, but it just hides under a rock. It hides under rocks, this anti everything from antisemitism, anti-latino, anti-black, it just hides, and the words of a president matter. And when they say things like he said, from the day he announced, they breathe oxygen under the rock. These people come out. I recommend you take a look at his book. I think it’s page 50 or 60. He’s talking about this constant struggle. There’s a picture. I think it’s 1924, maybe ’25, of 30,000 Klu Klux Klan people in full garb, pointed hats, the whole deal, walking down Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington. And you know why they were revived again after being defeated after the Civil War? To stop Catholics, Irish Catholics, Italian Catholics, Polish Catholics. We were going to pollute Christianity. I can remember stories to this day of my great aunt who was the best backscratcher in the world [inaudible 00:03:02]. She said, “Joey, I remember the black and tans, the people burning down the cods in Ireland when in fact you could not … No Irishman could learn to read or write.” My family, it got passed through. My never had that, but the point was it was still alive in many people. Every group of immigrants who’d ever come here are coming because they have something special. Last point I’m going to say to you, the reason why, and I’ve said this to foreign leaders and I mean this sincerely, the reason why we’re the best nation in the world is we are a nation of immigrants, because we’ve been able to cherry pick the best of every culture in the world. Because think about it. You know this. It takes enormous courage, optimism, determination, and the desire for make your family better to leave everything you’ve known and leave it behind and come to a place you don’t know. I really mean it. When my great, great grandfather got in a coffin ship in the Irish sea, not at all sure that he’d make it and be alive and ever see his family again, it took enormous courage. And these guys talk about somehow someone sitting down in Guadalajara and a daddy saying, “I got a great idea. Let’s sell everything we have, give it to a coyote. He could take us across the border, drop us in the desert, leave us a place we don’t know. Won’t that be fun?” It takes optimism and courage and it’s about family. Family, family, family. And I don’t want to get going. I’ve kept you too long. God love you. I’m going to need your help, need your advice as we go forward. And if we win, I’ll need your advice as well. Thank you, Mr. Vice President. Thank you. Appreciate you. Thanks. Thank you so much. I like her a lot."
"93","08-06-20"," … the issues raised in our plenary sessions yesterday. Please visit our service project site and participate in the fundraising challenge to support the Farmworkers’ COVID-19 Pandemic Relief Fund and the Las Vegas based nonprofit food bank, Three Square. We couldn’t be in Las Vegas in person this year, yet we can still support our community there. Please also consider making a direct contribution to these causes. For those of you who have shared with us the memory of loved ones who you have lost a COVID-19 on our remembrance and healing wall, we share in your grief and extend our deepest sympathy. Please visit the site on the conference experience to share your thoughts. We will get through this together. Now, I want to kick off this final portion of our NALEO 37th annual conference by introducing one of our presidential sponsors and hosts of today’s forum, Wells Fargo, represented by Mr. William M. Daley, vice chairman of public affairs at Wells Fargo and company. Wells Fargo has been a loyal supporter of the work we do at NALEO. With Wells Fargo’s support, we are able to provide our members with year-round networking opportunities, vital and cutting edge policy and discussions and other critical resources that help them in their work on the front lines of government. Wells Fargo also served as the chair of this year’s Edward R. Roybal Legacy Gala on March 11th. Now, that was the last time we were able to hold an in-person event. It was then that Eric Hoplin, head of external relations, announced that Wells Fargo’s ATMs would feature a message encouraging participation in the 2020 census as a result of our work together. Now as vice chairman of public affairs for Wells Fargo, Mr. Daley helps facilitate key relationships like ours. Prior to serving as President Obama’s chief of staff from 2010 to 2012, Mr. Daley worked in the private sector, and he also served as Secretary of Commerce in the Clinton Administration. It was then when he last joined us for NALEO 15th Annual Conference in 1998, as we were preparing for the 2000 census. So please join me in welcoming back to the NALEO Annual Conference, virtually a key partner, friend to our mission, our staff and our members. Please welcome the honorable William M. Daley, vice chairman of public affairs at Wells Fargo and Company. Welcome Mr. Daley. Thank you very much, Arturo. We are pleased at Wells Fargo to be back at NALEO once again, and being a sponsor and host of this most important forum. It’s great being back with friends and to have the opportunity to spend a minute or two to speak before we get to the really important things. I hope you and all the families of the people in on this call are staying healthy and are being careful. This is an unprecedented time in our nation and around the world. Communities, particularly diverse and underserved communities, are suffering mightily. There’s a lot of uncertainty about our future, and we’re not totally sure what the future holds for the pandemic. We must all work together to help the hardest hit recover. At Wells Fargo, we have already committed more than 175 million to address food insecurity, housing and other emergency needs during this COVID crisis. We are also donating all gross PPP fees, which are around $400 million, to help small businesses, particularly minority-owned businesses so they can survive and recover when things get better. At the same time, our country is facing a long overdue reckoning around racial equity, and the private sector must be part of this effort like no time before. Wells Fargo has made a number of important commitments on that front, including the creation of a new diversity leader whose position is about really trying to figure out what we do as a business in diverse communities and how we can provide better services, products, and be greater involved in those communities. And also, our senior leadership will have their compensation connected to the progress they meet in meeting our diversity goals. One of the most critical things to do, as Arturo mentioned, is to get an accurate census count. When I was Secretary of Commerce in 2000, as Arturo said, I oversaw the census, which is one of the most important traditions in our democracy. I’m proud to be involved again at Wells Fargo, for we are formerly encouraging our employees and those in our communities to do their civic duty by being counted. We’re running ads on over 13,000 ATMs across the country and promoting the census through social media and other media channels. We have also been urging our employees to register and make plans to vote early if they’re able to, during this most important election year. Like you, we do believe that every vote matters. Speaking of elections, I’m eager to hear from my friend, vice president, Joe Biden, so I will wrap it up by saying, we are extremely proud at Wells Fargo to not only be involved with NALEO, but to be involved with so many members in NALEO at the local level around the country. So again, Arturo, thank you for the opportunity to be involved, and it’s back to you and the vice president. Thank you very much. Thank you, Bill. We really appreciate your support and the support of Wells Fargo, and we look forward to working with you in the coming years to make sure that we’re able to do all that we can to fulfill our mission at the NALEO Educational Fund. Now I’m really excited to begin our presidential candidate forum. One of the main purposes of the NALEO Annual Conference is to bring together the nation’s top leaders and Latino policy makers together to engage in critical conversations about the future of our country. During presidential election years, like this one, we invite candidates running for their party’s nominations and those who become presumptive nominees. I am delighted to welcome back to the NALEO Annual Conference the honorable Joe Biden, the Democratic Party’s presumptive nominee for President of the United States. We also extended an invitation to President Donald Trump to join us. Mr. Vice President, we look forward to learning about your vision for the future of the nation and of the U.S. Latino community, and most critically, how you will address the challenges that we face. The strength of our democracy is being tested by the crises of COVID-19, misinformation, interference in our elections and the barriers to voting and to a fair and accurate 2020 census. The Latino community has been disproportionately affected by the pandemic, suffering higher rates of infection and tragic deaths, and have been economically devastated. We look forward to hearing how Latinos will be equitably included in COVID-19 health and economic recovery efforts, and how would your administration address existing disparities. We continue to look for courageous leadership to finally create a fair and humane immigration system and comprehensive reform that modernizes our obsolete approach to this issue. Latinos look to our leaders with the expectation that those at the very top of government will spearhead a voting rights agenda that protects the right to vote for all Americans. These are just some of the issues that are important to Latinos. Indeed, every American issue is a Latino issue. Many of these issues have been addressed through this virtual NALEO 37th Annual Conference, so in the spirit of continuing this conversation, I am happy to welcome the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, Vice President Joe Biden. Welcome. Hello, NALEO. How are you? Good to see you again, Arturo. I want to say a special hi to my good friend, and he is my good friend, Secretary Daley. Billy, it’s been a long time, pal. Glad to see you looking so well. I look forward to seeing you pretty soon. I’m honored to be with you all today, and I want to start by thanking Arturo for this opportunity to share my vision for Latinos in our country. If I have the honor of being elected president, I want to thank you for your opening remarks, and I’m going to need you if I get elected. Not just getting elected, if I get elected. Throughout our decades and your decades, I think I go way back. I may have been at that 39 years ago when you started, decades leading NALEO Education Fund. We’ve seen a lot of ups and downs in the Latino community, but none more stark than the last three and a half years. Donald Trump and his administration have pursued an all out assault. That’s how I phrase it, assault on Latino communities, from the moment he came down that golden escalator saying he was going to go after those Mexicans rapists. Remember? That’s how he started his campaign. It started the moment he announced his presidency, fanning the flames of fear and racism against Latinos. The flames of fear and racism against Latinos. It’s baked into every aspect of how he’s governed. And this week was an especially poignant reminder of the terrible consequence, allowing that kind of hate to grow, to grow unchecked. You know, I thought we could defeat hate, but and it only hides under the rocks. And when a president breathes oxygen in, it comes out roaring out. On Monday, we marked the one year anniversary of the tragic mass shooting in El Paso, where a gunman explicitly sought to target Latinos and 23 beautiful lives were stolen from us and their families. I know what it’s like to lose a child. And I know what it was like to lose a wife. It is awful. It is starkly. I shouldn’t get started. You know, the stakes of Trump’s irresponsible policies of division and hate that he promotes is real. These are life and death decisions. Whether it’s repeated attacks on Dreamers or his campaign of terror against immigrant communities, whether it’s his neglect of the people of Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria, which is outrageous or his repeated failures to make sure essential workers have the personal protective equipment they need. Donald Trump has failed the Latino community time and time again. So the question you ask Arturo, how are we going to make real a better life for Latinos? That’s the key question, and the future of our country literally depends on how we answer it. That’s how important it is. Because here’s the God’s honest truth, the future success that our country are going to depend on our ability to make sure Latinos have opportunities and the tools to succeed. Latino is among the fastest growing population in the United States. Already one quarter of our school children, one quarter of our school children are Latino. How in God’s name can we have a strong and thriving Republic if we don’t fully deal Latinos into every aspect of American life? These kids are not someone else’s kids, they’re our kids. The kite strings that lift our national ambitions aloft. That’s why earlier this week I released my Latino agenda. Things I’ve been working on all along and you know about, but I put them all in one place. It’s a comprehensive plan for not just how we’re going to undo all the harms that the Trump administration has inflicted, but how we’re going to really make sure Latinos are included in our plans to build back and build back better. That means investing in Latino’s economics mobility, because that’s the best basis of it all, economic mobility. Everything from making sure Latino small business owners can access capital to making it easy for Latino families to buy a home to build intergenerational wealth. How did every other middle class person do it when they came here? They were able to ultimately buy a home and build equity in the home and pass it on from generation to generation. One of the four planks of my Build Back Better plan is about addressing racial inequities across the entire economy. It’s about breaking the cycle where in good times, Latino communities still lag behind. In bad times, they get hit first and the hardest as you referenced, Arturo. And in recovery, they take the longest to bounce back and only get back to where they were at the beginning, which wasn’t a good place to begin with. We’re going to use every tool at our disposal to take on these inequities. My Latino agenda also focused on any race based health disparities. Latinos were among the biggest beneficiaries of the Affordable Care Act with millions gaining insurance for the first time. The uninsured rate dropped from 32% to 19%, and my plan would bring it down to zero. That’s what an incredible win, it was a significant win for Latino community. But now in the midst of a pandemic, when almost 160,000 dead, those families lost part of their soul, part of their heart. Donald Trump is trying to strip people off their healthcare coverage in court in the middle of a pandemic. And Latinos are burying some of the heaviest burdens, go through the higher rates of infection and because Latinos disproportionately serve in caregiving roles on the frontline jobs and increase the risk of exposure and save other people. It’s unconscionable. I’m going to protect Obamacare and build on it with a public option, so every single person can have access to high-quality, affordable healthcare. When it comes to fighting this pandemic, we have to be crystal clear. Everyone gets free access to testing and treatment. And when it’s available, a vaccine, everyone gets it. We have to fight this virus without regard to immigrant status. That’s the only way we’re going to beat this thing. And it’s only humane thing to do. We’re also going to expand access to high-quality education and take on the racial inequities in our education system. That starts early. We are making sure high-quality pre-K is available to every child, three and four years old. Because the studies show that increases exponentially the prospects of success through the entire 12 years. It goes all the way through making sure post high school education is affordable for Latino students, ensuring public colleges and universities are tuition free for families making less than $125,000 a year, doubling Pell Grants, $12,000, increasing funding for Hispanic serving institutions. I started today by speaking about the tragedy in El Paso one year ago. We also know Latinos suffer every day from hate crimes and gun violence. It doesn’t always make national headlines. Under the Biden administration, we’re going to get weapons of war and high capacity magazines out of our communities. I’m going to take the fight directly to the NRA and hold gun manufacturers accountable for the damage they caused to Latino families. Finally, we’re going to restore our values as a nation of immigrants. Trump fails to understand the basic truth of immigrants. That they’re the incredible source of our nation’s strength and they always have been. All the way back to the 1860s, when my Irish ancestors jumped on coffin ships in the Irish sea, not knowing where they are going, not knowing whether they’re going to make it to the shore all the way to today. There’s the reason we’ve been able to constantly renew and remake ourselves because we’ve been able to cherry pick the best of every culture. It takes courage to leave and come here from every continent, from every background. That’s why we’re who we are. If I’m elected president, we’re going to immediately end Trump’s assault on the dignity of immigrant communities. We’re going to restore our moral standing in the world and our historic role as a safe haven for refugees and asylum seekers, and those fleeing violence and persecution. My Lord, we’ve never made asylum seekers stay, seek asylum outside the United States of America. We’re going to stop the inhumane practice of separating children from their parents and work to reunite families. Look at all the families that are not reunited. We’re going to stop detaining people and definitely invest instead on case management programs to help ensure migrants get the support they need while they’re navigating the asylum process. It’s going to cost a lot of money, but it’s a hell of a lot cheaper than building a wall. We’re going to restore a sensible enforcement priorities and stop terrorizing Latino communities. The idea is you wait outside the 10 o’clock mass to grab someone from church. The anxiety for the children, the anxiety is overwhelming. It’s going to have a profound impact on a generation. We’re going to protect Dreamers and their families, and every single agreement that the Trump administration signed to turn local law enforcement and immigration officials. On day one, I’m going to send Congress a bill for immigration reform. We’ll focus on keeping families together. It’s about families, including providing a clear roadmap to citizenship for 11 million undocumented alien and undocumented immigrants. Stop treating them the way they’re being treated. We’re going to live in enriching our communities every single day. I know that’s a pretty big agenda, but this is a moment to get it done. The pandemic has lift the blinders off so many people in this country on who’s really essential to our economic strength. It’s not Wall Street bankers or CEOs. The middle class hardworking union members fighting for the rights of all workers, the folks in the Latino community who are busting their necks every day to keep the country running. And I believe, I really do believe we’re ready to close the respect gap, the dignity gap, the wage gap, the opportunity gap. So many Latino workers have suffered for so long. You know my dad used to have an expression, he say, “Joey …” When he lost the job up in Scranton and we had to move down to Delaware and my dad never went to college. He was a graceful, good man. He used to say, “Joey, a job’s about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about honor. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, ‘Honey, it’s going to be okay.’” That’s what we’re going to do. Dignity, honor, treating people. … Do, dignity, honor, treating people with dignity. We can build a new administration that reflects the full diversity of our nation, and the full diversity of the Latino communities. Now, when I mean full diversity, unlike the African-American community and many other communities, you’re from everywhere. They’re from Europe, from the tip of South America, all the way to our border in Mexico and in the Caribbean. And different backgrounds. Different ethnicities, but all Latinos. We’re going to get a chance to do that if we win in November. It means we need everyone to get out and vote. I can’t do this without your help. The path to victory in November is contingent upon Latino voters, particularly in those battleground states. I’m committed to speaking directly to the concerns of the Latino community and to mobilizing Latino voters. I have a significant staff. We’re trying to advertise on Latino stations, on Spanish-speaking stations. We need every single voter to sign up and get engaged in our campaign. We need you to get out and vote with your family and your friends. And make sure that people know how to register and how to vote safely during the pandemic. We need to provide voters with more options, not fewer. Need to expand the option for participation. No excuse absentee ballots, when you get an absentee ballot just because you need one and want one. Increased in-person early voting. Have enough poll workers who can sanitize the machines and make sure we can socially distance and wearing masks. A lot of taking away meaningful opportunities to go in-person on election day. Our campaign is putting together the largest voter protection effort in the United States’ history because we know that we have to. We’ve already seen the impact that the pandemic has had on voting rights and voting during the primaries. We know. We know that voter suppression was alive and well in America before the public health crisis. And make no mistake about it, as you pointed out, the Census is part of this, too. Everyone needs to be counted. Four former Census Bureau directors who have worked under nine presidents, both Democrats and Republicans, have called on the Senate and the administration to work to extend the deadline so we’d get an accurate count. Arturo, you mentioned the Voting Rights Act at the beginning. Well, today happens to be the 55th anniversary of its enactment. I worked like hell to strengthen and extend that Voting Act when I was chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. Throughout my career, going back to 1975, back then, in 2013 though the Supreme Court came along and stripped the teeth out of the Voting Rights Act. It’s of the preclearance provision, they said was no longer necessary. I’m going to make sure it’s reinserted if the Congress doesn’t get it done in the remaining months of this Congress. Just last year, 29 states, 29 states introduced or carried over bills that tried to make it harder for people to vote. This blatantly Unamerican. Our democracy, one person, one vote. That’s the very heart of who we are. And if the Senate, Republican Senate, Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump, don’t take up the bill, newly renamed in honor of my friend John Lewis to restore the Voting Rights Act to its full power, I will make it a priority on day one that we do that if I’m elected president. So, I guess what I really want to say is just thank you. Thank you for the opportunity to speak. And thank you again, Arturo, and everyone at NALEO for the work you’ve been doing. You make the country stronger. You make us all better. That’s not hyperbole. You make us all better, and the country is better, stronger, more prosperous, more decent, more honorable if we, in fact, reach out and embrace the largest population of immigrants in the United States and include them across the board. It’s a source of amazing strength for us. What I said, “I think because this COVID crisis and unemployment crisis” I think the American people are seeing that now. Least I hope that’s the case. I’m going to need your help if I’m elected to get all this done. May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Vice President for your remarks and thank you for joining us at this virtual NALEO annual conference. We wish we could have met in person, but I hope that should you be successful in your quest for election that you will join us next year in person at the NALEO 38th annual conference. More than anything else, we look forward to both political parties, both campaigns, and both candidates to engage Latino voters across all 50 states, so that Latino voters understand what’s at stake in this election and they can make an informed ballot. We need both candidates to fight for the Latino vote. So, now we are at the final part of our time together in this virtual NALEO 37th annual conference, the conference wrap-up. Thank you all for joining us and for being a part of the NALEO familia during these extraordinary times. If this was your first time attending an NALEO event, I hope it was worthwhile, and that you’ll consider becoming an NALEO lifetime member. I would like to thank another of our presidential sponsors, and the host of today’s conference wrap-up, Edison International. Their support has been invaluable in our ability to reach and serve our community and to reach our nation’s Latino elected and appointed officials. Edison’s track record of community engagement and giving back to build a better tomorrow is a part of their commitment to service, a promise that has realized their support of organizations like ours. So, please welcome Pedro Pizarro, president and chief executive officer of Edison International. Hi, Pedro Pizarro here again from Edison International. Thank you for attending the conference. We look forward to welcoming you in Hollywood, California next year. Thank you, Pedro, and Edison International for all you do in support of our organization. You know, we have reiterated how Latino elected and appointed officials need on the front lines of government as our nation continues to endure this crisis. But just because we are dealing with the pandemic does not mean that all other issues important to our communities disappear. This is why good leadership requires new, innovative strategies and collaboration for tackling the public policy issues our communities face. Our next guest is one of those Latino leaders. Serving as the mayor of one of the largest cities in the United States, please welcome my own mayor and member of the NALEO board of directors, Los Angeles mayor, Eric Garcetti. Thank you, Arturo. It is always a pleasure to be with my NALEO family, and it’s my great honor to follow Vice President Biden, a dear friend who asked me to be one of his national co-chairs and find a running mate. Somebody who’s been committed to our communities for his entire public life. I also want to acknowledge Edison International for helping to make this conference possible. And my fellow NALEO board members who are a source of strength and light every day for me and for this country. I look forward to this conference every year because it’s an opportunity to see friends, familiar faces, and to plan our future. To feel the power and potential of our extraordinary coalition. And though we can’t be together physically this year, our connections are unwavering. Our coalition is as strong as ever, and our vision is clear, for a more just America, a place where everyone belongs and a nation that lives up to it’s promise. Just as it did for my family and for many of yours. The barriers to those goals are always tough to scale, and in this moment of crisis, they seem nearly insurmountable. As we face a virus that’s struck every community but hit us, Latino families and people of color, with a devastating force. A recession that’s shaken every sector, but delivered too many knockout punches to too many of our workers struggling to pay rent, and immigrants cut off from federal relief. A Census count that’s been politically compromised and cut short for every community, but leaves so much hanging in the balance for cities and states with large Latinx populations. COVID-19 has affected all of us, but has not affected all of us equally. In my City of Angels, we saw these challenges early and rose to meet them, bringing testing to all residents, regardless of immigration status. Quadrupling test sites in areas with Black and Latinx residents. And establishing the largest emergency rental program in the nation. … precedented census resources to reach neighborhoods usually undercounted. And we provided critical cash assistance to more than 100,000 of our neighbors on the brink of financial ruin, nearly 44% of whom were Latino and Latina. We did all of this work because it was right and it was smart and it was just. But let’s not mince words. There are clear reasons why Latinos have fewer resources to weather this storm, why we’re dying more, why we’re losing our jobs more than any other group, and it didn’t need to be this way. This is what happens when the administration rolls back worker protections. This is what happens when a government launches a full scale years long assault on immigrants and their families. Takes parents away from children, forces dreamers and their loved ones back into the shadows. This is what happens when leaders create a climate of fear and tell people to go back to places they’ve never lived. When they seek to strip America of the very communities, culture, the legacy, the histories that have made us who we are. Well, our community knows what it’s like to struggle and to defy the odds. We’ve been here before and we know how to move forward. To write a new Capito, a chapter of ours, because our heritage is of ordinary people who have built coalition stronger than any unjust policy. Who’ve made changes that endured long after the abuses faded away. A spirit that lifted up farm workers who rose up alongside Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta, who marched and organized and fought until the rights achieved in the fields of Delano rang out across this nation. That mission that motivated leaders throughout California to stand up against Prop 187 and that awakened a new coalition that permanently changed the face of politics in my state and that is changing in all of yours as well. That tradition is what America’s first Chicano poet laureate, Juan Felipe Herrera, meant when he wrote [foreign language 00:02:02], freedom comes from deep inside. And that history and deep well of experiences endured, obstacles overcomed, that is our strength. What gives us confidence that even in this difficult hour, we will summon persistence and perseverance and passion to keep pushing forward. I wish that we were all gathered in one place to do that hard work face-to-face. And I think in a year’s time, I’m hopeful that we will be again. And I’m thrilled to announce that the NALEO Conference will be here in the City of Angeles in 2021. But whether we’re socially distanced or physically together, we can and we will unlock the power of our partnership. And by this time next year, I know we will look back and say, this was the year our communities took to the polls in record numbers to send an unmistakable message to Washington. That this was the year our voices carried from city halls and state capitals to the chambers of Congress and the corridors of Le Casablanca. And this was the year we didn’t just respond to an unprecedented crisis, but we reimagined what this country can be and reaffirmed our promise to all of our people. My friends, [foreign language 00:03:20]. Let’s get to work now. And with that, it is my deepest honor to introduce a dear friend and colleague, the leader of my city’s city council, the first Latina City Council president in the history of our city, [foreign language 00:03:36] Nury Martinez. Hello everyone, I’m LA Council President, Nury Martinez. The City of Los Angeles cannot wait to see you at the NALEO Conference in Los Angeles in 2021. As we wrap up this year’s virtual conference, I want to offer a few words of hope, optimism, and a little reminder about who we are as Latinos in what are clearly dark times. Our Latinx community is under attacked on all fronts, from a president who has attacked us from day one and who continues to attack us. And COVID-19 is attacking our community, killing Latinos at a higher rate than any other community, because so many of our people do not have the luxury to work from home. So what are we to do about this? We fight. That’s what Cesar Chavez taught us and that’s what John Lewis taught us and that’s what Dolores Huerta teaches us, fight and make good trouble. We need to fight to elect a president who supports our community and our fundamental rights as Latinos to live, grow, and prosper in this country. As a daughter of the working poor, Mexican immigrant from the city Zacatecas, growing up, little girls who look like me and talk like me were not supposed to end up in positions like this. And while I am honored to be the first Latina City Council president in 170 years in the city’s history, I must not be the last. There is no governmental body that women should not have a chance to lead anywhere in the United States, especially women of color. So I call on all of you, especially Latino men, to empower and uplift strong Latinas to run for office and to the positions of power that we so richly deserve. So let’s continue to make good trouble my friends. Thank you, Mayor Garcetti and Council President, Martinez. And I can’t tell you how much I wish that we will be able to gather everyone in-person next year here in the City of Angeles. So now our last guest is part of a very important relationship to our organization. The ability to collaborate, disseminate, and educate the public alongside trusted media partners is a critical part of the work that we do. Our relationship with Comcast NBCUniversal Telemundo has been a part of the foundation with which our organization has been able to reach our community and to do the work we set out to accomplish. That is why we would like to thank Comcast NBCUniversal Telemundo for their support as our national media sponsor for this year’s Virtual NALEO 37th Annual Conference. Your support for our organization has proven to be instrumental in accomplishing our mission. Our partnership with Telemundo has created a driving force of trustworthy and useful information, thoughtfully disseminated to consumers, the Spanish language media. From citizenship days to national census days to the various campaign efforts in which we have joined together, Telemundo has been an integral part of what has become an essential lasting partnership. That is why we see Comcast NBCUniversal Telemundo as an unparalleled partner and an ally to our organization. Please welcome Christina Kolbjornsen, Telemundo Senior Vice President of Corporate and External Affairs. Thank you Arturo. Once again, we are so proud to be your partner doing NALEO’s first virtual conference. The conference focused on many of the same important issues that NBCUniversal Telemundo continues to report on such as the COVID-19 pandemic, census, and of course, the 2020 elections. I am very proud to announce that Telemundo will join NALEO Education Fund on Wednesday, August 19th, for NALEO’s Convention Briefing series. It will be the first time ever in the organization’s history that they will hold both an English and all Spanish discussion with renowned political experts and strategists during the two political conventions. With more than 14. 6 million Latino voters expected to cast ballots this November, that Latino community is poised to play a decisive role in the outcome of the 2020 presidential election and other key races throughout the nation. The convention briefings will focus on the growth of the Latino electorate nationwide and in key battleground states, the success of Latino candidates and the various issues that are likely to affect Latino turnout this year. We are grateful for our shared mission and look forward to being back together in Los Angeles next year. Thanks Christina. And once again, thank you Telemundo for your support. And we look forward to the partnership with our Convention Briefings. Now, that is another NALEO tradition that we began in the 2000 presidentials cycle. Every four years, we bring to the national conventions, a conversation-"
"94","08-08-19"," When he said after Charlottesville there were, and I quote, “very fine people on both sides”, I said, then it gave license and safe harbor to white supremacists and Neo Nazis and the Klu Klux Klan. These words not only stunned America, but they stunned the world and in doing so, he has signed a moral equivalence. A moral equivalence between those spewing hate, and those that have the courage to stand against it. I said at the time, we’re in a battle for the soul of this nation. I said it again when I announced my candidacy, and I say it here today. We are in a battle for the soul of this nation. That’s why primarily I’m running for president. Charlottesville was no isolated incident. When Trump announced he was running for president, he called Mexicans rapists. Days before the midterm, he formatted fears of a caravan heading to United States creating hysteria when he said, “Look, look, some marching up. This is an invasion, an invasion.” He asserted that immigrants would quote, “carve you up with a knife”. More recently, he called a major American center city, a disgusting rat infected road mess. “No human being”, he said would choose to live as though the vibrant diverse community around Baltimore somehow was less than human. At a rally in Florida, when he asked the crowd, “How do we stop these people?” Meaning immigrants, someone yelled back, “Shoot them!” And he smiled. In North Carolina, he basked in the chants of “send her back” echoing across the stadium. How far is it from Trump saying this is an invasion to the shooter in El Paso declaring quote, “this attack as a response to Hispanic invasion of Texas”. How far apart are those comments? How far is it from white supremacists in Neo Nazis in Charlottesville? Trump’s very fine people chanting “you will replace us”. To the shooter at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh saying, “we’re committing genocide”. Jews are committing genocide on his people. I don’t think it’s that far at all. It is both clear language and in code, this president has fanned the flames of white supremacy in this nation. His low energy, vacant eyed mouthing the words written for him condemning white supremacists this week I don’t believe fooled anyone at home or abroad. His energetic embrace, an energetic embrace of this president by the darkest hearts and most hate-filled minds in this country say it all. When the white nationalist Richard Spencer celebrated Trump’s election by declaring, “hail Trump” at an alt-right conference where the Nazi salute was being used. In Charlottesville, David Duke, the former leader of the KKK said, “This is why we voted for Donald Trump, because he said he’s going to take back the country. After Trump tweeted his go back [inaudible 00:04:23], the leading Nazi website, Neo Nazi website said, “this is the kind of nationalism we elected him for”. He knows it. He saw it, and on 8chan, a haven for radicalism on the internet where a declaration of hate linked to El Paso shooter was posted. One commentator wrote that Trump is helping normalize the most extreme radical sentiments because his perceived authority carries so much weight. We have a problem with this rising tide of white supremacy in America, and we have a president who encourages and emboldens it. The statistics are clear. Extremism is on the rise in America. The southern poverty center finds that of the 1020 hate groups operating in the United States in 2018, that’s how many there are. They pointed out that white nationalist groups have surged by over 50%. In 2017, an active shooter with ties to white extremism claimed 135 victims and 70 killed. According to the Anti Defamation League, all but one of the 50 extremists linked murders counted in 2018 had direct links to white supremacists. His own FBI director recently testified to Congress that extreme right-wing groups, white nationalists posed the greatest threat to racially motivated domestic terrorism. And what has Trump done? He’s poured fuel on the fire. He’s retweeted postings from extremists and white nationalists. He’s cutting funding, and in some cases, completely eliminated funding initiated by Barak, by the president and I, in our administration to counter violent extremism at home. Trump readily, eagerly attacks Islamic terrorism, but can barely bring himself to use the words white supremacy. Even when he says it, he doesn’t appear to believe it. He seems more concerned about losing their votes than beating back this hateful ideology. He says guns are not the problem in mass shootings. The issue is mental health. It’s a dodge. Hatred isn’t a mental health issue. I can tell you as the guy along with Senator Dianne Feinstein, got the assault weapons banned and the high capacity magazines banned in this country for 10 years, if elected presidents, we will do it again. We will do it again. A hundred rounds date, 30 round clips in El Paso. They’ll be banned. And when we do it, we will put in place a buy back program to get as many as these military style weapons of war as possible off the street, and we need a domestic terrorism law. We can do it without infringing on anyone’s free speech, without tampering with anybody’s liberties. Quite simply, we have to make the same commitment as a nation to root out domestic terrorism that we have stopping international terrorism. I wish I could say that this all began with Donald Trump and will end with him, but it didn’t and I won’t. American history is not a fairy tale. The battle for the soul of the nation has been a constant push and pull for 243 years between the American ideal that says we’re all created equal and the harsh reality that racism has long torn us apart. The same document that promised to secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity also allowed for slavery, and the so-called three fifths compromise that discounted the very humanity of black people in America at the time. The honest truth is both elements are part of the American character. At our best, the American ideal wins out, but it’s never a route. It’s always a fight and it’s a battle that has never fully finished. Go back to the beginning, Thomas Jefferson wrote what many believed to be the most important civil document in human history, but he was a slaveholder. We’ve never lived up to our American ideals, Jefferson himself didn’t. But what he wrote has pulled us towards justice for more than two centuries and still does. It remains this nation’s north star. Take a look at the Klan, Klu Klux Klan. After the Civil War, we saw a rise in the Klan. It was beaten down only to rise up again in the twenties. In fact, in August of 1925, 30,000 fully clad Klansmen in their robes and pointed hats marched down Pennsylvania Avenue, the streets of Washington. Imagine. Imagine that today. And then the Klan was once again beaten back as it was after the Civil War. How? The courts, the press, and yes, presidents stood against them, and that is the point. Our institutions, often imperfectly, stood against hate at moments when we’ve been most tested. American presidents have stepped up in the past. George H W Bush renouncing his membership in the NRA. President Clinton after Oklahoma City. George W. Bush going to a mosque after 9/11, President Obama after Charleston. Presidents who led, who oppose, chose to fight for what the best of American character is about. There’s deafening silence now. Sadly, we don’t have that today. Our president has aligned himself with the darkest forces in this nation and it makes winning this battle for the soul of our nation that much tougher, harder. Trump doesn’t understand what Franklin D Roosevelt did. Roosevelt said, the presidency is quote, “preeminently a place of moral leadership”. You don’t see what JFK did when he said “only the president represents the national interest”. He’s blind. Lyndon Baines Johnson said of the office when he said, quote, “nothing makes a man come to grips more directly with his conscience than the presidency. Trump offers no moral leadership and seems to have no interest in unifying this nation. No evidence that the presidency has awakened his conscience in the least. Indeed, we have a president with a toxic tongue who has publicly and unapologetically embraced a political strategy of hate, racism, and division. So it’s up to us as it was in the 20s, it’s up to us. We’re living through a rare moment in this nation’s history where our president isn’t up to the moment, where our president lacks the moral authority to lead, where our president has more in common with George Wallace than he does with George Washington. You know, we are almost 330 million Americans. We’ll have to do what our president can’t, stand together, stand against hate, stand up for what’s best, our nation’s best. When we’re the best. In this nation, we believe, when we’re at our best, we believe in honesty, decency, treating everyone with respect, giving everyone a fair shot, leaving nobody behind, giving hate no safe harbor, demonizing no one, not the poor, the powerless, the immigrant or the other, leading by the power of our example, not by the example of our power. That’s allowed us to stand as a beacon to the world, being part of something bigger than ourselves. It’s a code. It’s uniquely American code. It’s who we are, but Donald Trump doesn’t get it. What this president doesn’t understand is that like every other nation on earth, we’re unable to define what constitutes America by religion, by ethnicity, or by tribe. You can’t do it. America’s an idea. An idea stronger than any army, bigger than any ocean, more powerful than any dictator or tyrant. It gives hope to the most destitute people on earth. It’s not only our values that are under assault, our democracy is as well. Free press, new independent judiciary, legislature. There’s a co-equal branch of government. These are the guard rails of our democracy. They’re written into our Constitution, and if you’ve noticed for the last two plus years, they’ve been under attack. Phrases like fake news, enemy of the people. They’re no joke. They’re insidious. They’re corrosion. Just look around the world. The worst despots are now using Trump’s language to justify their own abuses of power. Trump is trying to weaken our institutions, the press, the courts, the congress, precisely because they are the only checks on his power. That’s what this is all about. The abuse of power. There’s one thing I can’t stand and I know you can’t, is the abuse of power, whether it’s a boss taking advantage of his or her workers or a man raising his hand to a woman or a child or president who’s running rough shot over everything this country believes in standards. No matter how old or young you are, you’ve never seen anything like this in your lifetime. We’re being reminded every day there’s nothing guaranteed about democracy, not even here in America. We have to constantly earn it. We have to protect it. We have to fight for it. I believe America is in, as Lincoln named us the last best hope on earth. We have to remember why. It’s not because you’re the biggest economy, the strongest military in the history of the world, it’s not because we have the most innovative entrepreneurs and the greatest research universities. That’s all true, but it’s not why we’re America. The reason is what we believe. The most powerful idea in the history of the world, I think beats in the heart of the people of this country. It beats in all of us. No matter your race, your ethnicity, no matter your gender identity, your sexual orientation, no matter your faith, it beats in the hearts of the rich and poor alike, it unites America whether your ancestors were native to these shores, or they were brought here and forcibly enslaved, or they’re immigrants with generations back, like my family from Ireland or those coming today looking to build a better life for their families. The American creed that were all created equal was written long ago, but the genius of every generation of Americans has open it wider and wider and wider to include those who have been excluded in a previous generation. That’s why it’s never gathered any dust in our history books. It’s still alive today, more than 200 years after its inception. But I honest to God don’t believe Donald Trump’s sees it that way. On January 20th, 2017 in his inaugural address, Donald Trump painted a dark, bleak picture of our country in crisis when he declared, and I quote, “this American carnage stops right here. It stops right now”. But as the sitting president, Trump’s anger, hate and divisiveness, pitting Americans against one another, preying on our division and doing nothing, nothing about the endemic and the epidemic of guns is fueling a literal carnage in America. We now have more mass shootings in the year 2019 since January than we had day’s the past since January one 2019. As of Monday, according to the data from the gun violence archive, there’ve been 255 mass shootings in the first 217 days of this year. We can’t let this go on. We can’t, and I will not let this man be reelected President of the United States of America. We can’t. Folks. Folks. His incompetence, his amorality, his carnage stops with us right here, right now, starting in the Midwest. Limit it to four years, I believe, I really do believe this. In history, we’ll look back on this presidency as an abberant moment in American history, but if Donald Trump is reelected, I believe he will forever and fundamentally alter in the character of this nation. If we give Donald Trump four more years, this will not be the country envisioned by Washington and Adams and Jefferson. We give Donald Trump four more years, this will not be the nation bound together by Lincoln. We give Donald Trump four more years, this will not be the nation lifted up by Roosevelt or inspired by Kennedy. It will not be the nation. The Barack Obama proved bends toward justice. The danger Donald Trump and the alt-right pose to this nation isn’t hypothetical or exaggerating. It’s real. The core values is this nation, our standing in the world, our very democracy, everything that makes America America is at stake. Folks, everyone knows who Donald Trump is. Even the people who support him, we have to show who we are. We choose hope over fear. We choose science over fiction. We choose unity over division and yes, we choose truth over lies. If we stand together, we will win the battle for the soul of this nation. We are the United States of America. There is not a single thing beyond our capacity if we stand together and get up and remember who we are. This is United States of America. Period. Thank you, and may God protect our troops."
"95","08-12-20"," Please welcome Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Kamala Harris. Hello hello. Thanks for being here. I wish we were able to talk to the folks outside but we’re keeping our social distancing and playing by the rules. Good afternoon everyone. To me and to Kamala, this is an exciting day. It’s a great day for our campaign and it’s a great day for America in my view. Over the past several weeks I have had the incredible privilege of meeting and spending a good deal of time with a group of talented women leaders, all of whom are qualified to be president. With each one, the more I learned about them, the more I talked to them, the more impressed I was even though I knew them before. I want to thank each and every one of them for being part of this process and I look forward to working with them as we rebuild this country to get elected and once we are elected God willing. I approached this with a seriousness of purpose and of mind because this is a serious moment for our nation. We’re at one of those inflection points, you’ve heard me say that before, in our history. A life-changing election for this nation and the choice, the choice we make this November is going to decide the future of America for a very, very long time and I had a great choice. Great opportunities. I had a great choice but I have no doubt that I picked the right person to join me as the next Vice President of the United States of America and that’s Senator Kamala Harris. You know, it seems Americans all across this nation, at least at the outset here agree with me. Yesterday we had our best grassroots fundraising day of the campaign, more than double our previous record, and in doing so, we set a single day record for online political fundraising and I think I know why. So I hope that you’ll join us as well, those of you listening today. Go to joebiden.com today, $5.00, $10.00, whatever. Kamala, as you all know is smart, she’s tough, she’s experienced, she’s a proven fighter for the backbone of this country, the middle class, for all those who are struggling to get into the middle class. Kamala knows how to govern. She knows how to make the hard calls. She’s ready to do this job on Day One and we’re both ready to get to work, rebuilding this nation and building it better. As attorney general of the largest state in the country, Kamala took on the big banks over mortgage fraud and won. Took on big oil that wanted to pollute without consequences. She was a pioneer in marriage equality and tackled the gun lobby. You know, we’ve all watched her in the United States Senate go toe to toe with Trump officials trying to hide the truth, asking the tough questions that needed to be asked and not stopping until she got an answer and when none was forthcoming it was obvious what the answer was. As a member of the Intelligence Committee and the Judiciary Committee, she’s been the center, in the middle of the most critical national security challenges our country faces. Well aware, well aware of all the threats to this nation and ready to respond to them. As a child of immigrants, she knows personally how immigrant families enrich our country as well as the challenges of what it means to grow up black and Indian-American in the United States of America. Her story is America’s story, different from mine in many particulars, but also not so different in the essentials. She has worked hard, she has never backed down from a challenge, and she has earned each and every of the accolades and achievements that she has gained. Many of them often in the face of obstacles that others put in her way but never quit, and this morning, all across the nation, little girls woke up, especially little black and brown girls, who so often feel overlooked and undervalued in their communities, but today, today just maybe, they’re seeing themselves for the first time in a new way, as the stuff of presidents and vice presidents. In her campaign in the primary, Kamala often talked about what she referred to as the 3:00 a.m. agenda, about moms and dads awake late at night in their kitchens, worried, scared, uncertain about how they were going to take care of their families, about how they were going to pay the bills, about how they were going to make it, simply make it. Growing up in Scranton and Claymont, Delaware, I saw that struggle with my family as well. Kamala saw it with hers as well and millions of Americans are living that struggle as we speak, especially in this moment of crisis, especially with so many jobs lost. Kamala and I both know that all folks are looking for as my dad would say is an even shot, just give me a shot, a fair shot, a shot at making it and it will be the work of our administration to make sure they get a fair shot. Working families need someone on their side in this nation because they certainly don’t have anyone in the president now on their side. That’s going to change in a Biden-Harris administration. It’s going to be gratifying to see the strong, enthusiastic reaction to Senator Harris as our next vice president. It comes from people all over the country, it’s already occurring. All over the country, all ideological views, all backgrounds. Events of course, we are predictable, some of them. It comes from all over except of course from Donald Trump’s White House and his allies. You all knew it was coming. You could have set your watches to it. Donald Trump has already started his attacks, calling Kamala “nasty”, whining about how she is “mean” to his appointees. It’s no surprise because whining is what Donald Trump does best, better than any president in American history. Is anyone surprised Donald Trump has a problem with a strong woman or strong women across the board? We know that more is to come, so let’s be clear. If you’re a working person, worried about whether or not you have a job to go to, whether or not you’ll be able to pay your mortgage, pay your rent, worried about the poison in the air you breathe, the water you drink, worried about your civil rights, even your basic right to dignity which is under attack with this administration, Kamala Harris has had your back and now we have to have her back. She’s going to stand with me in this campaign and all of us are going to stand up for her. On January 20, 2021, we’re all going to watch Senator Harris raise her right hand and swear the oath of office as the first woman ever to serve in the second highest office in America in this land, and then we’re going to get to work, fixing the mess that President Trump and Vice President Pence have created, both at home and abroad through four years of mismanagement and coddling of terrorists and thugs around the world. Not only will America dig itself out of this hole they put us in, we’re going to build. We’re going to build back and we’re going to build back better. We have a public health crisis. While he’s in court trying to do away with health care, with more than five million reported infections, 165,000 people dead and climbing as a consequence of COVID-19 and still, months later, no real leadership or plan from the President of the United States how to get this pandemic under control. No real help for the states and local governments trying to fill the vacuum of leadership from the White House. No real help for children and educators, for small businesses and frontline workers, they’re the ones that are holding our country together. Instead, he’s issuing executive orders and making promises that in the end will defund the Social Security system while insisting that this virus will disappear. The Joe Biden and Kamala Harris administration will have a comprehensive plan to meet the challenge of COVID-19 and turn the corner on this pandemic. Masking, clear science-based guidance, dramatically scaling up testing, getting states and local governments the resources they need to open the schools and businesses safely. We can do this. We just need a president and vice president willing to lead and take responsibility. Not as this president says, “It’s not my fault. The governor should thank me more.” As that old saying goes, give me a break. We have an economic crisis and more than 16 million Americans, 16 million, still out of work. Donald Trump is on track to break another record. On track to leave office with the worst jobs records of any American president in modern history, but instead of doing the hard work, of meeting face to face with congressional leaders, Democrats and Republicans in the White House like every other president has done in a crisis, to get Americans the relief they need and deserve, Donald Trump is on the golf course. If I told you this three years ago you’d look at me like I was being crazy. He hasn’t even met with the leadership. He doesn’t have time it appears. We have a climate crisis that Donald Trump refuses to even acknowledge. When he thinks about climate change, all we hear is the word hoax. A Biden-Harris administration is going to meet the climate crisis, protect the health of the American public. Along the way, we’re going to deliver one word, jobs. Good paying jobs. We have a racial justice crisis. Donald Trump seeks only to inflame it with his politics of racist rhetoric and appeals to division. Today’s not only the day I’m proud to introduce Senator Kamala Harris as the vice presidential nominee of the Democratic Party. It’s also the third anniversary of that terrible day in Charlottesville. … close your eyes, and those Klansmen, white supremacists, coming out of fields, carrying lighted torches, faces contorted, bulging veins, pouring into the streets of a historic American city, spewing the same antisemitic bile we heard in Hitler’s Germany in the ’30s. Remember how it felt to see a violent clash ensue between those celebrating hate and those standing against it? It was a wake up call for all of us as a country. For me, it was a call to action. My father used to say, silence is complicity, not original to him, but he believed it. At that moment, I knew I couldn’t stand by and let Donald Trump, a man who went on to say when asked about what he thought he said, there were very fine people on both sides, “Very fine people on both sides.” No president of the United States of America has ever said anything like that, see him continuing to attack everything that makes America America. I knew we were in the battle for the soul of the nation. That’s when I decided to run. I’m proud now to have Senator Harris at my side in that battle because she shares with the same intensity I do, for she’s someone who knows what’s at stake. The question is for all Americans to answer, who are we as a nation? What do we stand for? And most importantly, what do we want to be? Someone who knows that the future of this country is limited only by the barriers we place on our own imaginations because there’s nothing Americans cannot achieve what we put our minds to it and we do it together. One of the reasons I chose Kamala is because we both believe that we can define America simply in one word, possibilities. Possibilities. Let me say it again, possibilities. That’s America. That’s what sets this nation apart, is that everyone, everyone, the ability for everyone, and we mean everyone, to go as far and dream as big as hard work and their God-given ability will take them. When I agreed to serve as President Obama’s running mate, he asked me a number of questions, as I’ve asked Kamala, but the most important was he asked me, what I wanted most importantly. I told him I wanted to be the last person in the room before he made important decisions. That’s what I asked Kamala, I asked Kamala to be the last voice in the room, to always tell me the truth, which she will, challenge my assumptions if she disagrees, ask the hard questions because that’s the way we make the best decisions for the American people. I got a chance to spend some time at my home today with Kamala and Doug, and I want to thank them. I thanked them then, but thank them publicly for agreeing to join and take this journey with Jill and me. Doug, you’re going to have to learn what it means to be a barrier breaker yourself in this job you’re about to take on, America’s first Second Gentlemen. And although they’re not with us here today, I want to thank Ella and Cole as well. I had a chance to speak to Doug’s mom and dad, and Ella and Cole, and we’re going to get our kids together to let them know what’s coming. My grandchildren are about the age of their children. I got to speak to them. My campaign has always been a family affair, every campaign I’ve run. So I’ve got some news for you, you’re all honorary Bidens. And here’s the best part, Kamala, you’ve been an honorary Biden for quite some time. I came first to know who Kamala was through our son, Beau Biden. They were friends. They served as attorneys general at the same time. They took on the same big fights together, Kamala in California, Beau here in Delaware. Big fights that helped change the entire country. I know how much Beau respected Kamala and her work, and that mattered a lot to me, to be honest with you, as I made this decision. So now we need to get to work, pulling this nation out of these crises we find ourselves in, getting our economy back on track, uniting this nation, and yes, winning the battle for the soul of America. My fellow Americans, now let me introduce to you for the first time, your next vice president of the United States, Kamala Harris. Kamala, the floor is yours. [inaudible 00:35:57] Thank you, Joe. Thank you. Thank you, Joe. As I said, Joe, when you called me, I am incredibly honored by this responsibility and I’m ready to get to work. I’m ready to get to work. After the most competitive primary in history, the country received a resounding message that Joe was the person to lead us forward. Joe, I’m so proud to stand with you. I do so mindful of all the heroic and ambitious women before me whose sacrifice, determination and resilience makes my presence here today even possible. This is a moment of real consequence for America. Everything we care about, our economy, our health, our children, the kind of country we live in, it’s all on the line. We’re reeling from the worst public health crisis in a century. The president’s mismanagement of the pandemic has plunged us into the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression and we’re experiencing a moral reckoning with racism and systemic injustice that has brought a new coalition of conscience to the streets of our country, demanding change. America is crying out for leadership, yet we have a president who cares more about himself than the people who elected him. A president who is making every challenge we face even more difficult to solve. But here’s the good news, we don’t have to accept the failed government of Donald Trump and Mike Pence in just 83 days. We have a chance to choose a better future for our country. So Joe, Dr. Biden, thank you for the trust you’ve placed in me. Jill, I know you will be an incredible First Lady. My husband, Doug, and I are so grateful to become a part of your extended family. Ever since I received Joe’s call, I’ve been thinking, yes, about the first Biden that I really came to know, and that of course is Joe’s beloved son, one of his beloved sons, Beau. In the midst of the Great Recession, Beau and I spoke on the phone practically every day, sometimes multiple times a day, working together to win back billions of dollars for homeowners from the big banks of the nation that were foreclosing on people’s homes. Let me just tell you about Beau Biden. I learned quickly that Beau was the kind of guy who inspired people to be a better version of themselves. He really was the best of us. And when I would ask him, “Where did you get that? Where did this come from?” He’d always talk about his dad. I will tell you the love that they shared was incredible to watch. It was the most beautiful display of the love between a father and a son. Beau talked about how Joe would spend four hours every day riding the rails back and forth from Wilmington to Washington so he could make breakfast for his kids in the morning and make it home in time to tuck them in bed each night. All of this so two little boys, who had just lost their mom and their sister in a tragic accident, would know that the world was still turning, and that’s how I came to know Joe. He’s someone whose first response when things get tough is never to think about himself, but to care for everyone else. He’s someone who never asks, why is this happening to me? And instead asks, what can I do to make life better for you? His empathy, his compassion, his sense of duty to care for others is why I am so proud to be on this ticket. Joe and I, yes, we are cut from the same cloth, family is everything to me too. I cannot wait for America to get to know my husband, Doug, and our amazing kids, Cole and Ella. Because whether I’m cheering in the bleachers at a swim meet, or setting up a college room dorm, or helping my goddaughter prepare for her school debate, or building Legos with my godson, or hugging my two baby nieces, or cooking dinner, Sunday dinner, my family means everything to me. I’ve had a lot of titles over my career, and certainly vice president will be great, but Mamala will always be the one that means the most. My mother and father, they came from opposite sides of the world to arrive in America, one from India and the other from Jamaica, in search of a world-class education. But what brought them together was the civil rights movement of the 1960s. That’s how they met, as students in the streets of Oakland, marching and shouting for this thing called justice in a struggle that continues today, and I was part of it. My parents would bring me to protests, strapped tightly in my stroller. My mother, Shyamala, raised my sister, Maya, and me to believe that it was up to us and every generation of Americans to keep on marching. She’d tell us, “Don’t sit around and complain about things, do something.” So I did something, I devoted my life to making real the words carved in the United States Supreme Court, equal justice under law. 30 years ago, I stood before a judge for the first time, breathed deep and uttered the phrase that would truly guide my career and the rest of my career, Kamala Harris for the people. The people, that’s who I represented as district attorney, fighting on behalf of victims who needed help. The people, that’s who I fought for as California’s Attorney General when I took on transnational criminal organizations who traffic in guns and drugs and human beings. And it’s the people who I have fought for as the United States Senator where I’ve worked every day to hold Trump officials accountable to the American people. And the people are who Joe and I will fight for every day in the White House. Let me tell you, as somebody who has presented my fair share of arguments in court, the case against Donald Trump and Mike Pence is open and shut. Just look where they’ve gotten us, more than 16 million out of work, millions of kids who cannot go back to school, a crisis of poverty, of homelessness afflicting black, brown, and indigenous people the most, a crisis of hunger afflicting one in five mothers who have children that are hungry and tragically, more than 165,000 lives that have been cut short, many with loved ones who never got the chance to say goodbye. It didn’t have to be this way. Six years ago, in fact, we had a different health crisis, it was called Ebola. … and Joe Biden did their job. Only two people in the United States died. Two. That is what’s called leadership. But compare that to the moment we find ourselves in now. When other countries are following the science, Trump pushed miracle cures he saw on Fox News. While other countries were flattening the curve, he said the virus would just poof, go away, quote, like a miracle. So when other countries opened back up for business, what did we do? We had to shut down again. This virus has impacted almost every country, but there’s a reason it has hit America worse than any other advanced nation. It’s because of Trump’s failure to take it seriously from the start, his refusal to get testing up and running, his flip flopping on social distancing and wearing masks, his delusional belief that he knows better than the experts. All of that is reason. And the reason that an American dies of COVID-19 every 80 seconds. It’s why countless businesses have had to shut their doors for good. It’s why there is complete chaos over when and how to reopen our schools. Mothers and fathers are confused and uncertain and angry about childcare and the safety of their kids at school. Whether they will be in danger if they go, or fall behind if they don’t. Trump is also the reason millions of Americans are now unemployed. He inherited the longest economic expansion in history from Barack Obama and Joe Biden. And then, like everything else he inherited, he ran it straight into the ground. Because of Trump’s failures of leadership, our economy has taken one of the biggest hits out of all the major industrialized nations with an unemployment rate that has tripled as of today. This is what happens when we elect a guy who just isn’t up for the job. Our country ends up in tatters, and so does our reputation around the world. But let’s be clear. This election isn’t just about defeating Donald Trump or Mike Pence. It’s about building this country back better. And that’s exactly what Joe and I will do. We’ll create millions of jobs and fight climate change through a clean energy revolution, bring back critical supply chains so the future is made in America, build on the affordable care act. So everyone has a peace of mind that comes with health insurance, and finally offer caregivers the dignity, the respect, and the pay they deserve. We’ll protect a woman’s right to make her own decisions about her own body, root out systemic racism in our justice system, and pass a new voting rights act. A John Lewis voting rights act that will ensure every voice is heard and every voice is counted. The civil rights struggle is nothing new to Joe. It’s why he got into public service. It’s why he helped reauthorize the voting rights act and restore unemployment discrimination and employment discrimination laws. And today, he takes his place in the ongoing story of America’s march toward equality and justice, as the only, as the only who has served alongside the first black president and has chosen the first black woman as his running mate. But as Joe always points out, this election is about more than politics. It’s about who we are as a country. And I’ll admit over the past four years, there have been moments when I have truly worried about our future. But whenever I think that there is a reason for doubt, whenever I’ve had my own doubts, I think of you, the American people, the doctors and nurses and frontline workers who are risking your lives to save others, the truck drivers and the workers in grocery stores, in factories, in farms, working there, putting your own safety on the line to help us get through this pandemic. The women and students taking to the streets in unprecedented numbers. The dreamers and immigrants who know that families belong together. The LGBTQ Americans who know that love is love. People of every age and color and creed who are finally declaring in one voice that yes, black lives matter. All across this country, a whole new generation of children is growing up hearing the cries for justice and the chance of hope on which I was raised. Some strapped into strollers of their own. And trust me, it’s a song you’ll never forget. So to everyone, keeping up the fight, you are doing something. You are doing something great. You are the heroes of our time and you are the reason I know we are going to bring our country closer to realizing its great promise, but to do it, we’ll need to work, organize and vote like never before, because we need more than a victory on November 3rd. We need a mandate that proves that the past few years do not represent who we are or who we aspire to be. Joe likes to say that character is on the ballot. And it’s true. When he saw what happened in Charlottesville three years ago today, he knew we were in a battle for the soul of our nation. And together with your help, that’s a battle we will win. Earlier this year, I said, “I do whatever Joe asks me to do.” And so now I’m asking you to do the same. So visit joebiden.com to get involved in this campaign and vote, because electing Joe Biden is just the start of the work ahead of us. And I couldn’t be prouder to be by his side, running to represent you, the people. Thank you and may God bless the United States of America. Thank you."
"96","08-13-20"," We talked about school openings. We talked about the distribution of a vaccine, if and when one arrives, and what plans would be made for. We talked significantly about the racial disparities that exist and how COVID-19 is affecting different races differently, and we talked about the continued lack of PPE protective equipment and testing capacity and the like. I’ve put out a comprehensive plan over the last three months on each of these things, but today I want to talk about one thing. Very straightforward. Doesn’t have anything to do with Democrats, Republicans or independents. It has to do with a single simple proposition: every single American should be wearing a mask when they’re outside for the next three months at a minimum. Every governor should mandate. Every governor should mandate mandatory mask wearing. The estimates by the experts are it will save over 40,000 lives in the next three months. 40,000 lives if people act responsibly. And it’s not about your rights, it’s about your responsibilities as an American. The fact is that as Americans are lining up to give blood, Americans volunteer all their time for food banks and local charities, supporting their neighbors that are in need. Well, this is no different. Wearing a mask is less about you contracting the virus, although it does help depending on the mask, but it’s about preventing other people from getting sick. Wearing a mask will give the life of a clerk or your local store or your letter carrier, your child’s teacher, it will increase their prospects of not contracting the virus. Even though it’s uncomfortable, we’re not used to it, wearing a mask is going to get our kids back to school sooner and safer. Wearing a mask, every American wearing a mask outdoors, is going to get our businesses back and the full strength long-term, and we’re going to get our country back on track. But again, when I get occasionally confronted with a person in the public about wearing a mask, I say, “Look, this is America. Be a Patriot. Protect your fellow citizens. Protect your fellow citizens. Step up. Do the right thing. Do the right thing.” There’s overwhelming evidence that the mask and depending on the type of mask you wear increases exponentially the prospect that you, if you are a carrier and you don’t even know it, that you will not infect anyone when you cough, sneeze, sing, shout. A lot of people are dying. We’re up over 160,000 people dead so far. And I’ll end by saying that it goes back to the study some months ago by Columbia University saying that we didn’t have to be this way. If the president had acted sooner, just one week earlier, it would have saved 30-some-thousand lives. Two weeks earlier, I think it was 51,000 or 57,000 lives. I hope we’ve learned a lesson. Hope the president has learned a lesson, but again, this is not about Democrat, Republican or independent. It’s about saving America’s lives, so let’s Institute a mass mandate nationwide starting immediately, and we will save lives. The estimates are we’ll save over 40,000 lives in the next three months if that is done. Now, let me turn it over to my colleague and running mate. She has a few comments to make. [inaudible 00:04:20]. Thanks, Joe. That’s what real leadership looks like. We just witnessed real leadership, which is Joe Biden said that as a nation, we should all be wearing a mask for the next three months, because it will save lives. And the thing about Joe that the American people know is that his role of leadership in our country has always been about doing what’s best for the people of our country, best for their health, their wellbeing, and for their families. That’s what real leadership looks like. And when Joe talks about his priorities, he knows and he cares about the fact that we have as a nation witnessed 165,000 people, who just in the last few months, have died in our country. We know that those individuals represent families, loved ones, grandparents, parents, sisters and brothers, aunts and uncles of people who are mourning their loss every day, so what real leadership looks like is Joe Biden to speak up, sometimes telling us the stuff that we don’t necessarily want to hear, but we need to know. And the need for this mandatory mask wearing will also be about what Joe has articulated and what a Biden-Harris administration will do in terms of creating a pandemic testing board to get tens of millions of testing kits were needed to build a public health jobs corps, hiring at least 100,000 Americans to lead us through contact tracing as soon as we take office, and to chart a clear path forward for a safe and effective vaccine and guarantee every American, every American equal access to it by investing $25 billion, which is Joe’s plan. $25 billion in manufacturing and distribution. When Joe talks about this, I think it’s important that the American people looking at the election coming up ask the current occupant of the White House, “When am I going to get vaccinated? When am I actually going to get vaccinated?” Because there may be some grand gestures offered by the current president about a vaccine, but it really doesn’t matter until you can answer the question, “When am I going to get vaccinated?” So again, Joe Biden is about real leadership in our country, and I’m honored to be with you, Joe. Thank you. Mr. Biden, can you tell us about your [inaudible 00:07:14]. What did she tell you? Anything on your [crosstalk 00:07:20]. We’ll talk about that later."
"97","08-17-20"," Oh, snap. How are you? The name’s Joe. Well hello there Joe. Hi, [crosstalk 00:00:16] as a matter of fact, watch me and my daughter. The love of my life, the life of my love. She’s a fan of yours. This is [Ashley 00:00:24]. Good. I’m good [crosstalk 00:00:26]. You know the nickname she gave her father when she was growing up?She’d call me Joey B. So we may be related or something [crosstalk 00:00:33]. Yep. Cardi B, Joey B [crosstalk 00:00:35]. I’m a huge fan [crosstalk 00:00:37] and I just wanted to say [crosstalk 00:00:38] hi. You doing … I feel so crazy, because I feel like I’m a little bit late. But Biden, let me tell you something. When you have kids my age, like the one my age, two years old. Your schedule never go as planned. You’re telling me. I got four kids, five grandkids. Come on. I’m an expert. I understand about kids. The most important thing in the world. They come first. Yes, definitely. Always. I kick them first, period. Keep it that way. So Joe, I heard you got some questions for me. Oh, I do have some questions for you. First of all, I want to congratulate you, the cover of Elle. I tell you, that’s pretty good. That’s pretty big time. Number one, doesn’t surprise me you’re on the cover. But number two, thanks for your generosity, dealing with people who are suffering from COVID. There’s so many people who needlessly are in trouble, who are needlessly have died when they didn’t have to, if we had taken the precautions we needed to. And thank you, you have a generous heart. You have a generous heart. I have a whole list of things that I want, and I wish, and I desire for our next president to do for us. But, first in first, let me [inaudible 00:02:02]. I just want Trump out. You know what I’m saying? I just feel like his mouth gets us in trouble so much. I don’t want to be lied to. I don’t want … We’re dealing with a pandemic right now, right? And I just want answers. I want to know when this is over. I want to go back to my job. I want to be able to go outside. I want to be able not to feel like I’m trapped in my home. And, but I don’t want somebody to lie to me and tell me that it’s okay to go outside. It’s okay not to wear a mask. That everything is going to be okay. No, I want a timeline of when things are going to get better. I want a president to tell me what are the steps for us to get better, besides taking precautions, like with our masks and quarantine. I need somebody to tell me, “This is going to be over when we find this cure. This is why it’s taking so long. This is why other countries are doing better than ours when it comes to this pandemic.” I need somebody to tell me the truth, the hardcore truth. And, also, I of course want free Medicare. And this is why it’s important to have free Medicare, because look what’s happening right now. You see why we should have been have free Medicare for a long time. I, of course, think that we need free college education, that’s second. And, I want black people to stop getting killed, and no justice for it. I’m tired of it. I’m tired of it, I just want more stricter laws, that is fair to black citizens, and it’s fair for cops too. If you kill somebody that doesn’t have a weapon on them, you go to jail. You know what? If I kill somebody, I got to go to jail. You got to go to jail too. That’s what I want, and it’s so sad that a pandemic has to happen so people could open their eyes on seeing what type of person are they dealing with. You know what I’m saying? It was like, you’re really confusing the people. One day you’re telling them that this is nothing, that people need to stop getting tested, because they’re going to get it anyways. Next thing you know you have a mask in your face, and you’re really playing games, not with us, not the wokes. You playing games with the people that support you … All of this has to happen, this crazy stuff that have to happen so they could open their eyes for the past four years. Well, it doesn’t have to happen. For example, in 2016 if 18 to 23 or four year olds have voted in the same percentage as the rest of the population, we would have had Hillary Clinton, not him. The vote matters. That’s why you keep talking to people about the need to vote. The vote matters. It matters a great deal. And so, we got to take … Look, the generation, your generation and the young millennials beyond that, they can own this. They can own this outcome, and they can own what happens in the next election. They are the ones that can change things dramatically, if they show up and vote. Tell me what your fans most say to you when they communicate with you online. Obviously free college education, free Medicare, especially now that people are just getting sick left to right, left to right. And that’s why I keep telling people, because sometimes people have problems in they community. They just wonder, for example, a lot of afterschool programs that I was growing up with, there’s no afterschool programs a lot anymore, in my hood. That’s right. Nowhere [crosstalk 00:05:55]. Because people don’t want to pay the taxes for it, and that’s why this whole thing about government’s bad has been such a downer for the things that really matter to you and me … I was doing very well as a single dad when my wife and daughter got killed, and I had two boys that survived that accident. I didn’t have the money to have someone to take care of my kids. Thank God I had my sister, and my brother, and my mother who helped me. My sister moved in with me, with she and her husband. But look at all the people that don’t have that kind of help. And you want to know something? Talking to you, I’m always so focused on Medicare and college education, and I never really thought about how important is childcare. You know what I’m saying? Because, I think that nobody’s more motivated than a mom. Nobody want to go and hustle out there, and get that money for they kid. Once you become a mom, you changed completely. Your mindset changed completely, but it’s like, how are you supposed to do that when you probably don’t have a babysitter for your kid? And I’m, fortunately for me, I’m able to, I have my mom take care of my child. But a lot of people, they mom cannot retire and take care of they kids. Their mom [crosstalk 00:07:12] has to work too. One of the things that I admire about you, is you keep talking about what I call equity. Just decency, fairness. Treating people with respect. John Lewis used to say, “The vote is the most powerful nonviolent tool you have. Use the power to change for the change you want by voting.” Look, I’m a lot older than you, to state the obvious. When I was in high school, what happened was we had the civil rights movement was just being started. And what happened? Along came Bull Connor and his dogs. He thought he was going to drive a wooden stake into the heart of the civil rights movement. But when all those folks who never realized, never saw before what was happening in the South, they lived in places where there were very few black people, didn’t know any black people. All of a sudden they saw Bull Connor with dogs ripping off the clothes of black women, elderly women going to church, and kids being knocked down with fire hoses and their skin being ripped off. All of a sudden, as Dr. King said, we had the second emancipation. We had the Voting Rights Act and we had the Civil Rights Act. It changed things, because people said, “”Oh my God, that’s happening. I think I heard you say somewhere along line what I’ve been saying, this cell phone has changed America. Because what happens now? We’re at a point where some brave kid, 15 years old can stand there, and for a total of eight minutes and 46 seconds take a photograph of a black man whose family I know and met with, and understand, and spent time with, and watched him brutally murdered, brutally murdered. And people around the world were saying, “My God.” … That it really happens, because I’m not in a neighborhood like that. I don’t come from a place. And now guess what? They’re demanding change. Black people, we’re not asking for sympathy, we’re not asking for charity. We are just asking for equality. That’s it. We are asking for fairness, and we are asking for justice. That is all. I feel like everything that people are asking for is getting interpreted in a very different way. No, it’s simple. We just want justice. That’s all. We want justice. We want to feel like Americans. We want equality. Treat me with respect [crosstalk 00:09:31]. People want … Yes, with respect. Respect. That’s where I think you’re seeing a real … Look, I have a friend who is a congressman in Mississippi, Bennie Thompson, and a very well known congressman, an African-American. He called me two weeks ago. He said, “Joe, I just came from a protest in Mississippi,” and he said, “and I looked out there, and there were … ” I forget how many people. He said, “There was many white kids marching as black kids. This is Mississippi Joe, things are changing Joe.” The reason I’m so optimistic is because of your generation. You’re the smartest, the best educated, the least prejudice and the most engaged generation in American history, and you’re going to change things. You’re going to change them. You’re the reason I have such incredible hope. I really mean it. I’m not trying to be nice. It’s a fact. That’s what’s going to change things. The rest of the world has always looked to us. Why have they looked to us? Not because we’re so powerful, but the power of our example. Look what they’re seeing now with this president. He’s literally promoting hatred, promoting prejudice, promoting racism, talking about protecting the Confederate flag when Mississippi takes it off their flag, and he’s defending it. He’s talking about stats. I mean, what this is all about, all about the game of making people hate each other, because that’s how he wins, by dividing us. But you’re going to change it. Your generation is changing. You already are doing it. The new generation, my fans, my people. And it’s like, this is why we have to go out and vote. I know that the young generation right now, with social media, we are just so eager to make money, to look a certain type of way, to have style, celebrity gossip. And in the primaries they kept saying, “Well, there’s not that many people voting. Biden not going to excite anybody.” We had the largest turnout in the primaries, ever. People are ready. They’re ready, and they know we can change it. But look, there’s a lot, but we really rely on people like you. And let me tell you something, the American people have never, ever, ever let their country down, given half a chance. Never. And they’ve been battered by corporate America, they’ve been battered by this president, particularly, and the way in which he’s able to continue to divide it. He appeals to the outright prejudice of some of those in that community that don’t have any money, and he just appeals to their prejudice. He spews hate. We got to stop it. Prejudice, it’s just so dangerous. It could be a start of a civil war. It makes people feel uncomfortable around different people. Nobody wants to feel targeted. Nobody wants animosity. We just want the best for us. Everybody just want the best for they self, they future [crosstalk 00:00:12:33]. That’s exactly right [crosstalk 00:12:34]. [inaudible 00:12:34]. I don’t want to live to tell my kid, “You have to be careful going to the store. Don’t wear this, this certain type of clothes. Don’t wear a mask. Don’t wear a hoodie. Please, don’t get stopped.” We don’t want that, and I don’t want to feel a certain type of hate, a certain type of animosity for different a race, because I feel like they get it easier than us. I don’t want to feel like that. Nobody wants to feel like that. That I guess that why can’t we just work with each other? And [crosstalk 00:13:11]. We can. [inaudible 00:13:12] And racism always have existed, but I feel like right now there’s just a lot of tension, and we need somebody to clean that. I’m just so tired of it. [crosstalk 00:13:24]. Well by the way, the country has been mourning. And what you’re finding now, is the vast majority of the American people understand what’s going on. My mom used to have an expression. Say, “Joey, the greatest virtue of all is courage, because without courage you couldn’t love with abandoned, and without courage none of the other virtues would exist.” It’s time for some courage, and you’re exercising it. Cardi, it’s not easy for you to do this. You’re going to get a lot of flack for the kinds of things you say, but you have the courage to stand up and say, “Now’s the time.” … By the way, we’re going to have, if I get elected president, free college education for four years of college, flat out. Anybody with a family, less than 125 grand, you’re going to get a free education. Everybody gets free education for community college. Everybody wants to go on and become an apprentice, free. Yep. I’m from New York. So when you’re in high school or middle school, they give you a free Metro card so you could travel. It’s for you to be able to go to your school, and of course they gave me free lunch. When I was in college I had to get a job, because I really needed five dollars, every single day, to be able to go from Washington Heights to Chamber Street, and then I had to feed myself. Sometimes I had to wait from 1:00 PM all the way to 9:00 PM, that’s my schedule, to get home so I could be able to eat. Because that whole time right there, I couldn’t afford to go to McDonald’s. I couldn’t afford to go to any restaurants around Chamber Street on my break, and you have to pay for lunch, the school lunch there. So, I was just starving, and I just felt so discouraged. So I just feel like that is so important, to finance students while they in college, because they get really discouraged. And that’s what people want to know. People want to know, can you provide college education, this Medicare plan, without a big chunk of taxes coming out of our checks. And the way we can pay for all of this, is doing practical things, like making sure that no corporation making a profit should pay less than 15% tax on their profit. None. Zero. Everybody has to pay their fair share. Thank you for your willingness to help. I promise … I’ll make mistakes as president, but I’ll admit to the mistakes I make, and you’re never going to have to wonder whether I’ll keep my word. All right. Thank you. I would like to see. Just check me out. I’ve never broken my word, anything I’ve said I was going to do, never in my life …"
"98","08-21-20"," The civil rights movement left us with this wisdom, give people light and they will find the way. Give people light. Those are words for our time. The current president has cloaked America in darkness for much too long. Too much anger, too much fear, too much division. Here and now I give you my word, if you entrust me with the presidency, I will draw on the best of us, not the worst. I’ll be an ally of the light, not the darkness. It’s time for us, for we the people to come together. And make no mistake. United we can and will overcome this season of darkness in America. We’ll choose hope over fear, facts over fiction, fairness over privilege. I’m a proud Democrat, and I’ll be proud to carry the banner of our party into the general election. So it’s with great honor and humility, I accept this nomination for president of the United States of America. But while I’ll be a democratic candidate, I will be an American president. I’ll work hard for those who didn’t support me, as hard for them as I did for those who did vote for me. That’s the job of a president. To represent all of us, not just our base or our party. This is not a partisan moment. This must be an American moment. It’s a moment that calls for hope, and light, and love. Hope for our future, light to see our way forward, and love for one another. America isn’t just a collection of clashing interest, of red states or blue states. We’re so much bigger than that. We’re so much better than that. Now, nearly a century ago, Franklin Roosevelt pledged a new deal in a time of massive unemployment, uncertainty, and fear. Stricken by a disease, stricken by a virus, FDR insisted that he would recover and prevail and he believed America could as well. And he did and we can as well. This campaign isn’t just about winning votes. It’s about winning the heart, and yes, the soul of America. Winning it for the generous among us, not the selfish. Winning it for workers who keep this country going, not just the privileged few at the top. Winning it for those communities who have known the injustice of a knee on the neck. For all of the young people who have known only America being a rising inequity and shrinking opportunity. They deserve the experience of America’s promise. They deserve to experience it in full. No generation never knows what history will ask of it. All we can ever know is whether we’re ready when that moment arrives. And now history has delivered us to one of the most difficult moments America’s ever faced. Four, four historic crises, all at the same time. A perfect storm, the worst pandemic in over a hundred years, the worst economic crisis since The Great Depression, the most compelling call for racial justice since the sixties and the undeniable [inaudible 00:03:37] and just the accelerating threats of climate change. So the question for us is simple. Are we ready? I believe we are. We must be. All elections are important but we know in our bones, this one is more consequential. As many have said, America’s at an inflection point, a time of real peril, but also of extraordinary possibilities. We can choose a path of becoming angrier, less hopeful, more divided, a path of shadow and suspicion, or we can choose a different path and together take this chance to heal, to reform, to unite, a path of hope and light. This is a life-changing election. This will determine what America is going to look like for a long, long time. Character is on the ballot, compassion is on the ballot, decency, science, democracy, they’re all on the ballot. Who we are as a nation, what we stand for, and most importantly, who we want to be, that’s all on the ballot. And the choice could not be more clear. No rhetoric is needed. Just judge this president on the facts. 5 million Americans infected by COVID-19. More than 170,000 Americans have died. By far the worst performance of any nation on earth. More than 50 million people have filed for unemployment this year. More than 10 million people are going to lose their health insurance this year. Nearly one in six, small businesses have closed this year. And this president, if he’s re-elected, you know what will happen. Cases and deaths will remain far too high. More mom and pop businesses will close their doors, and this time for good. Working families will struggle to get by, and yet the wealthiest 1% will get tens of billions of dollars in new taxes breaks and the assault on the Affordable Care Act will continue until it’s destroyed, taking insurance away from more than 20 million people, including more than 15 million people on Medicaid, and getting rid of the protections that President Obama worked so hard to get passed for a hundred million more people who have preexisting conditions. And speaking of President Obama, a man I was honored to serve alongside for eight years as vice president. Let me take this moment to say something we don’t say nearly enough. Thank you, Mr. President, you were a great president, a president that our children could and did look up to. No one’s going to say that about the current occupant of the White House. What you know about this president is if he’s given four more years, he’ll be what he’s been for the last four years. The president takes no responsibility, refuses to lead, blames others, cozies up to dictators, and fans the flames of hate and division. He’ll wake up every day believing that job is all about him, never about you. Is that the America you want for you, your family, your children? I see a different America, one that’s generous and strong, selfless, and humble. It’s an America we could rebuild together. As president the first step I will take would be to get control of the virus that has ruined so many lives because I understand something this president hasn’t from the beginning, we will never get our economy back on track, we will never get our kids safely back in schools, we’ll never have our lives back until we deal with this virus. The tragedy of where we are today is it didn’t have to be this bad. Just look around. It’s not this bad in Canada, or Europe, or Japan, or almost anywhere else in the world. And the president keeps telling us, the virus is going to disappear. He keeps waiting for a miracle. Well, I have news for him. No miracle is coming. We lead the world in confirmed cases, we lead the world in deaths. Our economy is in tatters, with Black, Latino, Asian-American, Native American communities bearing the brunt of it. And after all this time, the president still does not have a plan. Well, I do. If I’m your president, on day one, we’ll implement the national strategy I’ve been laying out since March. We’ll develop and deploy rapid tests for the results available immediately. We’ll make the medical supplies and protective equipment that our country needs, and we’ll make them here in America, so we will never again be at the mercy of China or other foreign countries in order to protect our own people. We’ll make sure our schools have the resources they need to be open, safe, and effective. We’ll put politics aside. We’ll take the muzzle off our experts, so the public gets the information they need and deserve, honest unvarnished truth. They can handle it. We’ll have a national mandate to wear a mask, not as a burden, but as a patriotic duty to protect one another. In short, we’ll do what we should have done from the very beginning. Our current president has failed in his most basic duty to the nation. He’s failed to protect us. He’s failed to protect America. And my fellow Americans, that is unforgivable. As president, I’ll make you a promise. I’ll protect America, I will defend us from every attack, seen and unseen, always, without exception, every time. Look, I understand. I understand how hard it is to have any hope right now. On this summer night, let me take a moment to speak to those you who have lost the most. I have some idea how it feels to lose someone you love. I know that deep black hole that opens up in the middle of your chest and you feel like you’re being sucked into it. I know how mean, and cruel, and unfair life can be sometimes. But I’ve learned two things. First, your loved one may have left this earth, but they’ll never leave your heart. They’ll always be with you, you always hear them. And second, I’ve found the best way through pain and loss and grief is to find purpose. As God’s children, each of us have a purpose in our lives. We have a great purpose as a nation to open the doors of opportunity to all Americans, to save our democracy, to be a light to the world once again, and finally, to live up to and make real the words written in the sacred documents that founded this nation, that all men and women are created equal, endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights among them, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. My dad was an honorable, decent man. He got knocked down a few times, pretty hard, but he always got back up. He worked hard and he built a great middle class life for our family. He used to say, “Joey, I don’t expect the government to solve my problems, but I sure in hell expect them to understand them.” And then he’d say, “Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in the community. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, ‘Honey, it’s going to be okay,’ and mean it. I’ve never forgotten those lessons. That’s why my economic plan is all about jobs, dignity, respect, and community. Together we can and will rebuild our economy. And when we do, we’ll not only build back, we’ll build back better, with modern roads, bridges, highways, broadband, ports and airports as a new foundation for economic growth, with pipes of transport, clean water, to every community, with 5 million new manufacturing and technology jobs so the future is made in America. With a healthcare system that lowers premiums, deductibles, drug prices, by building on the Affordable Care Act he’s trying to rip away. With an education system that trains our people for the best jobs of the 21st century. There’s not a single thing american workers can’t do. And where cost doesn’t prevent young people from going to college and student debt doesn’t crush them when they get out. With a childcare and eldercare system that makes it possible for parents to go to work and for the elderly to stay in their homes with dignity. With an immigration system that powers our economy and reflects our values. And with newly empowered labor unions. They’re the ones that build the middle class. With equal pay for women, with rising wages you could raise a child on, a family on. And yes, we’re going to do more than praise our essential workers. We’re finally going to pay them. Pay them. We can and we will deal with climate change. It’s not only a crisis, it’s an enormous opportunity, an opportunity for America to lead the world in clean energy and create millions of new, good-paying jobs in the process. And we can pay for these investments by ending loopholes, unnecessary loopholes, and the president’s $1.3 trillion tax giveaway to the wealthiest 1% and the biggest, most profitable corporations, some of which do not pay any tax at all. Because we don’t need a tax code that rewards wealth more than it rewards work. I’m not looking to punish anyone. Far from it. But it’s long past time the wealthiest people and the biggest corporations in this country paid their fair share. And for our seniors, social security is a sacred obligation, a sacred promise made they paid for. The current president is threatening to break that promise. He’s proposing to eliminate a tax that pays for almost half the social security, without any way of making up for that loss revenue, resulting in cuts. I will not let that happen. If I’m your president, we’re going to protect social security and Medicare. You have my word. One of the most powerful voices we hear in the country today is from our young people. They’re speaking to the inequity and injustice that has grown up in America. Economic injustice, racial injustice, environmental injustice. I hear their voices, if you listen, you can hear them too. And whether it’s the existential threat posed by climate change, the daily fear of being gunned down in school, or the inability to get started in your first job, it will be the work of the next president to restore the promise of America to everyone. And I’m not going to have to do it alone because I’ll have a great vice president at my side, Senator Kamala Harris. She’s a powerful voice for this nation. Her story is the American story. She knows about all the obstacles thrown in the way of so many in our country, women, Black women, Black Americans, South Asian Americans, immigrants, the left out and the left behind, but she’s overcome every obstacle she’s ever faced. No one’s been tougher on the big banks and the gun lobby. No one has been tougher in calling out the current administration for its extremism, its failure to follow the law, its failure to simply tell the truth. Kamala and I both draw from our families. That’s where we get our strength. For Kamala it’s Doug and their families. For me, it’s Jill and ours. I’ve said many times, no man deserves one great love in his life, let alone two. But I’ve known two. After losing my first wife in that car accident, Jill came into my life. She put our family back together. She’s an educator, a mom, a military mom, and an unstoppable force. If she puts her mind to it, just get out of the way. She’s going to get it done. She was a great second lady and I know she’ll make a great first lady for this nation. She loves this country so much. And I’ll always have the strength that can only come from family. Hunter, Ashley, all our grandchildren, my brothers, my sister, they give me courage, they lift me up. While he’s no longer with us, Beau inspires me every day. Beau served our nation in uniform, a year in Iraq, a decorated Iraqi war veteran. So I take very personally the profound responsibility of serving as commander in chief. I’ll be a president who’ll stand with our allies and friends and make it clear to our adversaries, the days of cozying up to dictators is over. Under President Biden, america will not turn a blind eye to Russian bounties on their heads of American soldiers, nor will I put up with foreign interference in our most sacred democratic exercise, voting. And I’ll always stand for our values of human rights and dignity. I’ll work in common purpose for more secure, peaceful, and prosperous world. History has thrust one more urgent task on us. Will we be the generation that finally wipes out the stain of racism from our national character? I believe we’re up to it. I believe we’re ready. Just a week ago yesterday, was the third anniversary of the events in Charlottesville. Close your eyes, remember what you saw on television. Remember seeing those neo-Nazis, and Klansmen, and white supremacists coming out of fields with lighted torches, veins bulging, spewing the same anti-Semitic bile heard across Europe in the thirties. Remember the violent clash that ensued between those spreading hate, and those with the courage to stand against it. Remember what the president said when asked. He said they were “very fine people on both sides.” It was a wake up call for us as a country, and for me, a call to action. At that moment, I knew I’d have to run, because my father taught us that silence was complicity, and I can never remain silent or complicit. At the time, I said we’re in the battle for the soul of this nation, and we are. One of the most important conversations I’ve had this entire campaign. It was so someone who was much too young to vote. I met with six year old Gianna Floyd the day before her daddy, George Lloyd was laid to rest. She’s an incredibly brave little girl and I’ll never forget it. When I leaned down to speak to her, she looked in my eyes and she said, and I quote, “Daddy changed the world.” Daddy changed the world. Her words burrowed deep into my heart. Maybe George Floyd’s murder was a breaking point. Maybe John Lewis’ passing is the inspiration. But however it’s come to be, however it’s happened, America’s ready in John’s words, to lay down, quote, “The heavy burden of hate at last.” And in the hard work of rooting out our systemic racism. American history tells us that it’s been in our darkest moments that we’ve made our greatest progress, that we found the light. In this dark moment, I believe we’re poised to make great progress again, that we can find the light once more. Many people have heard me say this but I’ve always believed you can define America in one word, possibilities. The defining feature of America, everything is possible. That in America, everyone, and I mean, everyone should be given an opportunity to go as far as their dreams and God-given ability will take them. We can never lose that. In times as challenging as these, I believe there’s only one way forward, as united America, a united America, united in our pursuit of a more perfect union. United in our dreams of a better future for us and for our children. United in our determination to make the coming years bright. Are you ready? I believe we are. This is a great nation. We’re good and decent people. For Lord’s sake this is the United States of America, and there’s never been anything we’ve been able to accomplish when we’ve done it together. The Irish poet, Seamus Heaney once wrote, “History says, don’t hope on this side of the grave, but then, once in a lifetime, the longed-for tidal wave of justice can rise up and hope and history rhyme.” This is our moment to make hope and history rhyme with passion and purpose. Let us begin you and I together, one nation, under God, united in our love for America, united in our love for each other. For love is more powerful than hate, hope is more powerful than fear, and light is more powerful than dark. This is our moment, this is our mission. May history be able to say that the end of this chapter of American darkness began here tonight as love and hope and light join in the battle for the soul of the nation. And this is a battle we will win and we’ll do it together. I promise you. Thank you, and may God bless you, and may God protect our troops."
"99","09-02-20"," Folks, welcome to the Queen Theater. I’m here today to talk about a crisis, a crisis being felt all across the United States of America. And Jill and I have just been briefed, as you know, in this room, by our public health and education experts about what it’s going to take to be able to reopen our schools safely and effectively. And back to school has always been a special time [inaudible 00:02:26] your families and mine, but particularly in mine because for all the years Jill and I were married, she was going back to school too as a teacher. Jill’s an educator and she’ll be the first one to tell you that this should be a season of promise for our country, times when classrooms are crackling with the possibilities of the new year, students’ hopes, and all about the future. But this year, we’re facing the most difficult circumstances and we’re seeing an awful lot of heart and a lot of grit from our educators, our students to try to rise to the occasion here, but our government hasn’t come up to that bar. They haven’t shown much grit at all or determination. Let me be clear. If President Trump and his administration had done their jobs early on with this crisis, America’s schools would be open and they’d be open safely. Instead, American families all across this country are paying the price for his failures and his administration’s failures. Like many of you, because you’re all reporters, you also have a lot of friends and you have children, and you’re probably hearing the same thing I’m hearing throughout this pandemic. They’re struggling to figure out how to do the right thing, but they’re worried. They’re worried like the devil. “What does it mean for my kids? Is this setting my child’s education back beyond just a semester? What impact will it have? How’s my child going to catch up? What if I’m not doing enough to help my child succeed?” All those questions, the self-doubt that’s been engaged. President Trump may not think this a national emergency, but I think going back to school for millions of children and the impacts on their families and the community is a national emergency. I believe that’s what it is. Protecting our students, our educators, our communities, getting our schools open safely and effectively, this is a national emergency, but President Trump still doesn’t have any real plan for how to open our schools safely, no real plan for how to help parents feel secure for their children. He’s offering nothing but failure and delusions. From the start to finish, the American families and our children are paying the price for his failures; failure to take this virus seriously early on in January and February and it spread around the globe, failure to take steps we needed back in March and April to get this pandemic under controlled institute widespread testing and tracing to control the spread, failure to provide clear national science-based guidelines to state and local authorities, and failure to model even basic responsibility like socially distancing and wearing a mask, and failure to make sure educators and administrators have the equipment, the resources, and the training they need to open safe and under the circumstances we find now. Donald Trump and Betsy DeVos, Secretary DeVos, haven’t stepped up and we’re all seeing the results. Millions of students are now starting the new school year in the same way they finished the last one, at home. At home. Parents are doing their best, but more and more, were finding themselves at wit’s end, struggling to balance work and childcare and educational duties, or worrying about their lost paycheck and how they’ll make ends meet while trying to keep their kids on track with remote learning. Educators are taking on countless hours of additional training to learn how to use remote learning tools so they can still be there for their students, but they’re worried about all the kids who used to count on our schools, all those children who need it so badly, and particularly those children who need more than the education and they provide their meals and safe places to spend the day. You know, we’re all concerned about making sure COVID-19 doesn’t further exacerbate the disparities, the disparities that already have existed in our educational system for so many poor children and in so many communities of color. It’s unacceptable and it can’t go on like this. We all want our schools to reopen safely with a plan that prioritizes the health of our students and our educators and staff alike. I laid out my plans back in June and July, a roadmap for how to open and reopen safely and effectively. You can read them by going to JoeBiden.com. We need straight forward common sense solutions, but Trump refuses to act, starving schools have the needed funding, funding they need now. Now. They needed it beginning of the summer. Now, Trump’s FEMA director is cutting schools loose. Just yesterday, FEMA announced that after helping three districts, I think it was three, they announce that they’re not going to help pay for cloth masks, other PPE for school settings, cleaning, those basic health needs, or sanitize, everything from the lavatories to the classrooms, and safety costs for schools that don’t qualify for emergency assistance. This is emergency, Mr. President. This is an emergency. And Donald Trump and his FEMA should treat it as one. If I were president today, I’d direct FIM to make sure that our kids K through 12 get full access to disaster relief and emergency assistance under the Stafford Act. I’d make sure that PPE and sanitation supplies for school qualify as emergency protective measures, which is a phrase they use, to fully be eligible for federal assistance. On top of that, I’d be working with the leaders of Congress now, today, to pass emergency packages for schools so they have the resources they need in order to be able to open safely, money for ventilation. I heard that a lot when I had all those health care experts up on the Zoom. Money for ventilation and other health measures, but also more money to hire more teachers. Every recommendation we got was they should be dividing into pods, smaller classes. Smaller classes mean more educators are needed. Keeping classes socially distanced, small. Money for more psychologists and counselors. I introduced legislation a long time ago calling for [inaudible 00:09:42] I proposed legislation a long time ago. We have one school psychologist for every 1,507 children in school. … at home, in going to school, not being able to go to school, the nation’s superintendents of schools have estimated that they’ll need at least $200 billion to support K through 12 schools throughout the year for safe reopening. And we need the money to hire educators as well for our four-year colleges and universities, for community colleges, for HBCUs, for minority-serving institutions. Democratic leaders are ready to get this done. They’ve already proposed legislation. Mr. President, where are you? Where are you? Why aren’t you working on this? We need emergency support funding for our schools and we need it now. Mr President, that’s your job. That’s your job. That’s what you should be focused on now. Getting our kids back to school safely. Keeping schools safely able to remain open once they open. Not whipping up fear and division. Not inciting violence in our streets. Get off Twitter and start talking to the congressional leaders in both parties. Invite them to the Oval Office, the Oval Office, and stop your boast about never being seemed at what you can do anything. You always talk about your ability to negotiate. Negotiate a deal. A deal for somebody other than yourself. Now I’m happy to take questions you may have, I guess staff’s going to call on whoever. Follow, fire away. Great. MJ. Vice President, two quick questions for you if I may. First, ahead of your trip to Kenosha, Wisconsin tomorrow, last week your running mate, Senator Harris, said that the officer who shot Jacob Blake, based on what she has seen should be charged. I think we should let the judicial system work its way. I do think there’s a minimum need to be charged, the officers, and as well as Breonna Taylor and I might add, by the way, I think what happened in Portland where one of the Trump guys riding along in vans and inciting responses were shooting rubber bullets, I guess, or paint balls. Apparently there was someone shot by someone in the crowd with a bullet, killed. I think that person should meet legal requirements, whatever that calls for. He should be investigated and it should follow through on what needs to be done. Let the judicial system work. Let’s make sure justice is done. Just probably on a different topic, there’s a new book by the New York Times by Michael Schmidt that says that when president Trump made an unannounced visit to Walter Reed hospital in 2019, Vice President Pence was told to be on standby to take over in case President Trump had to receive anesthesia. Pence said last night that he doesn’t recall being told that. As vice president, were you ever told to be on standby or given any kind of special alert when President Obama was going in for a medical appointment? And I also just wonder whether you have any concerns about the fact that that Walter Reed visit that President Trump made, it didn’t follow prior protocol about presidential visits for medical examinations. I’m not going to speculate on what it means always, but I can say is that nothing this administration does is normal. And so I’m not being facetious when I say that. So who in God’s name knows what it was all about? I just don’t know. I don’t know. And I’m not going to speculate. I’ll let the experts do that. And so, and the only time that I have been on notice is when the president’s out of the country and I’m in the country, that not that I should wait for something to be immediately be aware of anything, but that’s something that might be called for. It wasn’t called for. Thank you. Thank you Mr. Vice President. On your visit to Kenosha tomorrow, local democratic officials including the governor had previously discouraged President Trump from visiting and just yesterday, the president of the local NAACP said he didn’t want to see either of the candidates, including yourself visit. That this is such a sensitive situation in the city. Well, I have already spoken to all the leaders up there and although I have an outstanding call with the governor who we’ve dealt with the staff because, and there’s been overwhelming requests that I do come. Because what we want to do is we’ve got to heal. We’ve got to put things together, bring people together. And so my purpose in going will be to do just that, to be a positive influence on what’s going on, talk about what need be done and try to see if there’s a beginning of a mechanism to bring the folks together. We have to heal. This is about making sure that we move and we move forward. And so I’ve gotten advice from sitting members of the Congress and the Senate as well to go and that I should go. I’m not going to do anything other than meet with and meetings with community leaders, as well as business people and other folks in law enforcement. And to see, to start to talk about what has to be done. I’m not going to tell Kenosha what they have to do but we have to do together. The idea that we are saying the president’s current people retreat to their corners and keep this movie is just a mistake. I spent my whole life, including in this city you’re in right now, bringing people together. Bringing the community and police officers together. Bringing business leaders and civic leaders together. And so that’s my purpose in going. And on the fact that you’re traveling to Wisconsin at all. I believe this is only the third time in the last few months, since the onset of the pandemic, that you’ll be on a plane. You’ve talked about how you want to make sure you’ll follow all the advice of your doctors in terms of campaigning safely. But the question we keep hearing from voters, from others, is why aren’t you out there more. You may be aware the president was calling into question your campaign’s scheduled today. Well, I think my message is getting out based on what the polling data shows and the millions of people who’ve watched, what I’ve had to say and the circumstance which I’ve said it. But I would like to get out more. But I think a president has a responsibility to set examples, set the right example for how to get out. Not go out and not wear a mask and not to have large crowds of people standing next to one of their not wearing masks, not being a potential called room for significant outbreaks of COVID. And so what I’ve done is I’ve met with, via what I did this morning with the medical experts. And so we’ve worked out a protocol where, how I get in the plane, what kind of plane I get on, how it’s sanitized, how I engage people. It’s like when I’m engaging all of you everywhere I go. It’s always at a safe distance and everybody’s wearing masks. And the vast majority of people that I’m meeting with have been, had come into my home and staff and the like, they’re all tested as well. So I’m just trying to set the example, wearing the protective gear, the mask, which I have with me. I’m able at this distance to take it off, number one. Number two, making sure that we proceed in a way with adequate social distancing and do it the right way. And last quickly they announced the format and the moderators of the presidential debates today. NBC’s Kristen Welker, we’re batting cleanup for that last presidential debate. Well, I began to prepare by going over what the president has said, multiple lies he’s told. What I’d love to have as a crawler at the bottom of the screen of fact checker when we speak. If we really want him to do something, I think that would make a great, great debate. If everything both of us said was instantly fact-checked by an agreed to group of people out there then we move forward. But probably wouldn’t get very far in the debate. Now I’m looking forward to debating the President and I’m going to lay out as clearly as I can, what I think we have to do to bring this country back and build it back better. And I’m looking forward to the debate. That’s great. Thank you [inaudible 00:19:44]. Thank you Mr. Vice president. … and in cities in this country, including the situation in Kenosha, Wisconsin, where you’re headed. First of all, I wouldn’t incite violence. I condemn it when it occurred. I would move to, look, the vast majority of police officers are good, decent, honorable women and men. They pin on that shield every morning and they have a right to go home that night safely. The vast majority. But just those who are not good cops, all the police I’ve dealt with my whole life, and I’ve been dealing with, I’ve gotten overwhelming support from law enforcement through my whole career. They’re the ones that want to get rid of the bad cops, even more than anybody else does because it reflects on them. Number one. Number two, I would make sure everybody understood, if I were president, that any violence, any violence, protesting is a right and free speech is a right, but to engage in violence, burning, looting, the rest, in the name of protesting is wrong, and that persons should be held accountable for their actions. What I’d be doing is I’d be bringing people together in the White House, right now. I’d be having that Police Commission set up. I’d have law enforcement at the table. I’d have the community at the table. I’d have people and saying, “How do we get through this? What do we do to deal with this?” Because I believe the vast majority of the community at writ large, as well as law enforcement, want to straighten things out, not inflamed things, but this president keeps throwing gasoline on the fire, every place he goes. I noticed, and I didn’t watch much of it, but I watched the reports from all of you, not all, I from the press. When he was asked about what should be done with regard to a young man shot in the back seven times, in front of his children, I didn’t hear much of anything come from him. What should we be doing about it? He went down the line. I wish he’d take responsibility. As much as he’d like to be running against somebody else, he’s running against me, Joe Biden. The fact is, that he is not acting very responsible. [inaudible 00:22:37]. Mr. Vice-president. I’m sorry. Am I, over here? Okay. You’ve outlined your plan to reopen schools safely. That’s right. And help their children full-time to learn virtually. Help is on the way. I’ve laid out a clear plan for childcare, a clear plan for starting early education as well, so three and four and five year olds are in school. But I’m not President right now. What we should be doing, is we should be providing for more help for people who in fact, are trying to juggle the choice between, do I stay home with my three, four or five-year old and take care of them in the middle of this COVID problem? Or, do I go to work and earn a salary? What do I do? That’s why we have, I have a major initiative to deal with childcare and eldercare, so people can be adequately paid to come and take care of folks, children, as well as the elderly that you may be taking care of a parent, a husband and wife may be taking care of, as well as making sure that those folks are able to get back to work. That’s why focusing on daycare centers and making sure they’re safe and healthy now ,is equally as important as dealing with, almost as equally important as dealing with schools. We should be providing all of the PPE and all of the safety that is necessary in sanitary capacity, to allow them to open. Hundreds of them have been opening, because some states have gone in and done that. There should be universal guidance coming from the President of United States of America. There should be basic standards to how, in fact, and what circumstances you can safely open a daycare center, you can safely open a childcare center. In addition to that, in the future, the idea, this has brought home a number of glaring problems we have in America, this whole pandemic, and what’s happened in terms of jobs. The idea that we’re in a situation where you have so many parents who have to make the difficult choice as a single parent or both working parents, to decide whether one gives up their salary and stays home with a child under the age of five or six, and/or somehow leaves them with somebody that there’s not particularly qualified and goes to work so they can earn a living, is a choice that is not, we shouldn’t be making. We’re the only industrialized country in the world that forces people to make that kind of choice. There should be, no one should have to pay more than 7% of their income to provide for childcare and be able to go to work. This is something that is a major element of my Build Back Better program. But in the meantime, in the meantime, the most important thing that can be done is have CDC issue really straightforward guidelines, on what circumstances you should be able to open up your daycare center or your childcare center now. There should be clear standards and states should have the wherewithal to be able to go out and inspect those facilities, now. But, one I haven’t mentioned, and I think it warrants mentioning. One of the things we did, remember when we inherited the great recession and we were going into the tank, heading off the cliff or heading into a depression, I was able to convince three Republicans had changed their vote. We ended up with the so-called Recovery Act, which spent over $800 billion in 18 months, kept us from going into depression. But what did we do? We spent almost, we spent billions of dollars, making sure that states were able to maintain their essential workers. Everyone from their fire departments, their school teachers, their doctors, their nurses, their public hospitals. Now what’s happening? This Republican administration will not support that and the Republican leadership in the United States Senate will not support it. So, what’s happening? We don’t have that help. It’s not out there. States are in real trouble and to quote my good friend, Mitch McConnell, he says, “Let the states go, bankrupt.”States have to balance their budgets, under the law. Communities, counties, cities, they have to balance their budget. There’s a reason why the federal government is able to run a deficit, to compensate in times of real economic crisis and what’s happening, nothing, nothing. Guess what? We came out of that recession with the longest spurt of economic growth in any administration in American history. But these guys don’t, I don’t [inaudible 00:27:33] and I could go on. Businesses, look at the money that was passed under the CARES Act, for businesses, small businesses be able to stay open. You have tens of thousands of going out of business, many of them permanently. Why? Because, the money didn’t get to small businesses. They’re not open. We should be dealing with those businesses that have been burned out and those and damaged. We should be finding federal help for those businesses to get back on their feet. But this administration seems to think it’s all of a sudden going to go away, like angel dust is going to be sprayed around. Everything’s going to be okay. I just don’t get it. They have to know better. They have to know better. We had an example, just the last administration, how much good you can do and how much growth you can generate. I just don’t get these guys. I really, don’t. Not a joke. I’ve been doing this a long time, but I’ve never seen a president lack as much leadership, unwilling, an inability to make a deal. You got about, I’m told the reason why they can’t get anything done in the Republican Congress, is 20 members of the United States Senate saying under no circumstances, will they raise the deficit at all. Well, that’s wonderful. We’re in a position we’re in now. Look at other countries. They’re doing one hell of a lot better. Yet, we still have over, what’s it up to, 186,000 people dead. Over 6 million, was it, 6, ,000, whatever the number is, that have contracted the disease and no end in sight. It’s just irresponsible. Talk about a no-nothing Congress. On the Republican side. No, not even the president. I mean, I don’t get it. I really don’t get it, but it’s going to change, come January, God willing. Well, I say that I understand their concern, because so many of the teachers also have other preexisting conditions that lend itself to the fact that if they were to contract the COVID disease, COVID-19, that they would be very susceptible to be in real trouble. It’s understandable why they’re doing it. But the first thing to do, is make sure that all the protective capacity that we have available to us is made available. Capacity that we have available to us, is made available and then let the districts make choice about whether or not they open fully, whether they rotate and whether or not those teachers are able to be able to teach from home and remote learning. But it’s really understandable why they would, look what’s happened in this coed crisis so far. A hundred million, I mean 100,000 people have died who were above the age of 65. 100,000 out of the 200 and some that have died or not 200 and some, it’s 189 or whatever it is now. It estimated, I heard today, the estimates range from two significant universities. One, there’s going to be as many as 239, I think. And another one said by December, 312. I don’t know that, but it’s going to go higher. And so, I don’t understand why it’s a political problem? What is the politics about not being willing to go in and help provide the protective capacity for people to be able to go back to work and don’t go to school? I can’t fathom it. Thank you, Mr. Vice President. You talked today about reopening schools. Wanted to ask you about something you said last week about the potential of having to shut down the economy again. You were asked if you’d be willing to shut it down if you’re health experts advise you to do so and you said, “I will be prepared to do whatever it takes.” And that you would listen to the scientists. But I’m curious how you would do that at a federal level and how you would balance that, call the shut down potentially, if you had economic advisors saying, “You do this again, you could plunge the country into an even deeper economic crisis. Well, look, I know you’re tired of hearing me say this. I’ve been saying it since last January. The idea that you’re going to be able to get the economy back on track without getting COVID under control is completely counterintuitive. It’s not there. It can’t happen. Unless we’re able to deal with the disease and drastically cut its impact on people’s confidence of being able to either go to work or walk into a business or do business, then it doesn’t matter a lot. There is going to be no need in my view, to be able to shut down the whole economy. I got asked by David Murer, a question. If I was asked to shut everything down, I took that as a generic question. I am going to insist and I insist now, without any authority, that every responsible person in this country, when they’re out in public or not with a cohort that they have lived with, because they know they haven’t spread it to their husband, wife, et cetera, that they wear a mask. That they wear a mask and keeps socially distanced. You can take a mask off when you’re 12, 15 feet away, but I would really, really make the case. And by the way, when I find these folks talking about my freedom, I talk about patriotism. Why do you wear a mask? To protect your neighbor, to keep someone else from getting sick and maybe dying. I call that patriotic. This is the United States of America. Every generation has made sacrifices to help others in moments of crisis. Let’s say, you had suggested there’d be some kind of a federal mandate about masks. No, no. What I suggested was I would ask every person in authority. There’s a question whether or not a president, under the constitution, could mandate everyone wearing masks. And remember all during the primary, I’d have a lot of people telling me I would by executive order, do. I’m a constitutionalist. You can’t do things the Constitution doesn’t allow you the power to do. What I be doing is putting as much pressure as I could on every governor, every Senator, excuse me every mayor, every county executive, every local official, and everyone in business, putting pressure on them to say what you’re doing is irresponsible. Make sure you wear a mask and maintain social distancing. And the vast majority of the American people accept that notion. One more quick campaign question. You raised $364.5 million, your campaign and the DNC last month, record for a monthly haul, apparently. You want to go dinner? No. I tell you what, look, what I’m having to spend a lot of it on is to counter the lies that are being told by Trump’s campaign and swift voters out there, a new pack. But what I’m trying to do is spend most of that … And by the way, I think the average contribution was like 40 bucks. We have over a 1,600,000 people who contributed in the middle of this economic crisis, somewhere between five, 10, $15. I’d say that shows some genuine enthusiasm about wanting to make sure that we have a chance of becoming President of United States. And so, what I will spend most of it doing is trying to explain to the American people how I want to unite the country, what I want to do to make the country better, why I’m so confident we can do it, why I’m so confident that we can bring the country together and be in a better position than before this crisis occurred. Because there’s been so many fissures exposed as a consequence of what’s happened, that people are now realizing my Lord, I didn’t know that people in that circumstance didn’t have that kind of help. I didn’t know, whatever. And so I think we have an enormous opportunity to bring the country together. And once again, lead the world. You’ve heard me say it a hundred times, not just by the example of our power, but the power of our example. Thank you all so very much for taking the time. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you."
"100","09-03-20"," Hi. Hi. While we’re waiting for them to come up I’m going to make a quick announcement. Thank you all for being here. I just want to remind everyone that this event has been set up to adhere to social distancing guidelines. Accordingly, please keep your mask on while you are speaking in accordance with the Governor’s mandate. And thank you again for being here. At the end of the program, we will give you guidance to take a socially distanced photo. Thank you. If you want one. I’m sorry, father, I thought I was supposed to come up this way or [inaudible 00:00:35] taken the wrong way. I apologize. That’s okay. [inaudible 00:00:41]. Good, sir. Can’t do that anymore. [crosstalk 00:00:45] You got some guns. All right. Good afternoon, everyone. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. I can’t hear you. Good afternoon, everyone. Good afternoon. There you go. Yes. Well, my name is Tim Mahone, I’m the chair of The Mary Lou & Arthur F. Mahone Fund and I appreciate everyone being here. I want to thank Reverend Barker for your hospitality and convening what we know is a very important discussion in our community. Vice president, Joe Biden, Dr. Jill Biden is in the house, I believe somewhere. Yeah she’s doing something with teachers. As she always does. I’d like to welcome both of you here for what you know is a town of love, unity and compassion. As you know, you’ve spent most of your career unifying people, bringing people together. And much like in your hometown, Scranton, you’ve often talked about family values, working class families. Kenosha is that kind of town, where we come together as people. And what unites us in our inner soul is love, compassion. And in this time of healing and hurt and pain, we need that love and compassion. And we know your leadership is all about unity, not division. It’s about healing. So we thank you for being here today because we know your leadership is important in Kenosha and in our country. But we also know, and let’s be clear, Black Americans face systemic racism in a variety of areas. Let’s be real about that. Much like many marginalized communities, far too long. And we know with your vision and your leadership and your sense of urgency to dismantle systemic racism in healthcare, workforce development, education, affordable housing, we know your vision will heal this country. We know your vision will bring neighborhoods back together and we thank you for that. Now it gives me great pleasure to introduce to you our host, Reverend Barker, please come and give us opening prayer. Well, welcome everybody. It is a real privilege to look out on my neighbors here in Kenosha. And I can see so many people who had, at the core of their life, seeking welfare and praying for the welfare of our city. So it is a real privilege to have all of you here today. It is a real privilege to have Vice President Joe Biden here today to listen and to seek healing and justice for us in Kenosha. And so thank you all for taking time this afternoon to come to Grace Lutheran. Welcome. Well, please rise, as you’re able, as I offer a prayer. Let us pray. Oh, healing God. We continue to lift up Jacob Blake. Lord, continue to bring healing to his grievous wounds. Lord, miraculously enable him to walk again. Lord, we lift up his family. Bring them comfort during this tumultuous, challenging time. Oh God of justice, we ask for justice for Jacob Blake. We ask for justice for our community here in Kenosha. Oh God who anoints leaders to guide us, we ask that you anoint the leader of our country in November, who will at their core seek justice, love mercy, humbly walk with you and love their neighbor as themselves. And God, I have great confidence that you will make that happen for us in November. I pray all of these things in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen. You may be seated. Thank you, Reverend Barker for those inspiring words. And also I want to thank you for the great work you do in the neighborhood. As you know, not far from here, we have devastation and destruction and we know your churches have a leadership role in that rebuild and recovery. So thank you for that and many blessings. So here we are, ladies and gentlemen, we’re here to have a community conversation. Is that right? There’s a few ground rules in the interest of safety and health and wellness that we protect each other, so social distancing rules are important and will be applied. We have four selected speakers that we’re going to start with. I’ll call them up. We’ll ask them to speak and speak to the mic that’s closest to you. And then after they’re finished, we’ll call up folks as you choose to speak. However, we ask that you practice the social distancing and the microphones that are here. Take your time. I’ll give you about five minutes per person. I’ve been told I have the right to kind of put the mask over your mouth and shut it down a little bit. Shut it down, but take your time. Because as you know, Vice President, Joe Biden’s here to listen and learn and help us heal. First of all, this is Tim Tompkins, community resident, former Marine. Tim. Good afternoon. And thank you very much for coming today. What I’d like to talk about, what’s occurring in Wisconsin, is really something that’s an American issue and that’s about race and equality. And when we talk about race and equality in America, we need to move beyond the conversation of programs. We need to start putting money behind the programs and putting things into action. Several years ago, Ben Gordon, who was with the NAACP, said, “We know what the problems are. We need to start putting money behind the solutions.” We know what the problems are in the African American community. We know what the problems are in the Hispanic community. But when you’re looking at Wisconsin, which is considered the worst place in the United States for people of color, 34% of African Americans live in poverty, 24% of Hispanics, 28% of Native American Indians and 18% of people who are of Asian descent. So when you talk about that race inequality, it also means about inclusion and taking those steps that we need to address those issues. We need to address the issues of employment. We have all of these jobs that are around here, but we don’t have median… The median income and the difference between white families and African Americans in the State of Wisconsin is 50%. We’re earning 50% of what those family incomes are. And so if we’re not paying people living wages, the automotive industry that was here, [inaudible 00:08:32] American Brass, we’re a community that built things. And so we’ve got a lot of intelligent people, we have a lot of skills that are still here. It’s just tapping into those resources and creating those opportunities and employment. When I was the HR director in a municipality, one of the things that we did is we banned the box. We don’t need to look for new employees to look for a workforce, we’re pushing them out of the prison system each and every day. When those individuals come back to our communities, what we need to do is start providing second chances for them. We also need to address the gaps within our education system. Not that we don’t have a public education system, but we have a public education system that is not equitable. We need to make sure that each program in every school is the same. We need to make sure that Black sports programs and white sport programs are funded the same. We need to make sure that science programs and art programs are funded the same. Not that they just exist, but that they have the same quality and that they’re of the same quilt because you cannot build programs that do not have the same resources and economic ability to push those forward to be successful. The biggest thing that I see going on right now, and it just breaks my heart, when we talk about race and equality, we have to look at housing. Right now, we look at what’s going on during this COVID. We have so many people right now because of not having the economics and not being in work at this time, they’re losing their housing. If you looked over at Texas over the last couple of days, it’s heartbreaking to see all these people in the middle of a pandemic, in the middle of just having a hurricane come through this area, and now they’re being placed on the streets with their belongings. And so we’ve got to move beyond that. The other thing that’s still out there is that we need to create jobs. We need to create living wages and opportunities for people so that they can be a part of that American dream. I was going to talk about the criminal justice system, but we have such a wonderful person here who is going to be able to follow up on that. And we have to realize that we’ve got to stop pushing people into jail. We have to start getting solutions such as rehabilitation. When the crack epidemic hit America and it was in the Black community, America’s solution was jail, jail jail. Now that we have opioids in the white community, the solution is to provide police, firefighters with NARCAN and save the lives and send them back home to their families and make sure that they have the rehabilitation services. We really need to take a look at our criminal justice system because we don’t have the mental health services and we don’t have the drug addiction and other services needed to prevent people from getting caught up in a cycle that takes away from that American dream and takes away from that opportunity for equity. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Tim. Jeff [Weidner 00:11:35], could you please come forward. 30 years of great service as a firefighter. Wonderful young man. Thank you, Jeff. Thanks for coming. Thanks for listening. Our members are tired after this past week. Some them are beat up pretty good. But their spirits are high. And the reason that their spirits are high is because of the appreciation and love that our community has shown us after the fires. Everything that’s been dropped off at the firehouses, to people stopping us on the street and telling us thanks. And it made me think about appreciation. I think a lot of people at a lot of different levels need to start showing appreciation for one another and letting people know that everybody matters. I know I feel good when I feel appreciated. I think it’s a basic human thing that everybody else does too. One of the interesting things in the fire department is that we have an opportunity to see so many social and economic problems in people’s homes before there is a program, before there is access to healthcare, before there is an actual problem. I’ve seen it for 30 years. I’d like to tell you that it’s getting better every day, but it’s not. One of the things that we see, particularly in the areas of people of color is their ability to access healthcare at a time when it has a chance to be preventative, to be healing. So many of the things that we see are a result of chronic ability not to get at healthcare. Those small things turn into chronic things. Those chronic things turn into emergencies. That’s when we get called. And as a result of that, our systems are being taxed. And in many cases, and we’ve even asked people, “Why did you not seek help from your doctor?” “I don’t have a doctor.” “Why did you not take this heart medication?” “I can’t afford it.” Okay, well now we’re at a point now where you’re taking a trip to the emergency room. At times we are the only healthcare that some folks have access to. We never fail to show up. We show up damn fast and sometimes even that’s not enough. So those are some of the things that we see with regard to a problem in the community that needs attention. If there were clinics or there were availability for low level healthcare access, we wouldn’t see quite so much of what we have to deal with from an emergent standpoint. And again, pride, dedication, and courage. That’s what we all signed up for. Our thumbs are all up and we’re forging forward and we’d like a whole bunch of other people to be able to feel the same kind of appreciation we do. So thanks for being here. Appreciate it. Absolutely. No I’ll wait. [crosstalk 00:00:15:13]. Okay. Jeff, thank you for that. And thank you for continuing to keep Kenosha safe. And we appreciate that. 103 years of service. Can I touch this? Thank you Joe, for being here. It’s a great honor for me to be invited here. My name is Barb DeBurgh and my sister and I have a framing and art gallery two blocks down the road. Our great grandfather started our business and our business has succeeded through recessions, depressions and all the difficulties that happen. But we have never, ever seen anything as devastating as what has gone on in our community. We’re very fortunate because they didn’t start our building on fire, like so many of them in the uptown area have been burned to the ground. They did break our windows, get into our store, they looted and they tried to start a fire, but a good Samaritan came by and took this rack of our beautiful scarves out into the sidewalk and put it out. Otherwise, our store would have been up in flames. And I look at the buildings in our community that are gone. And I don’t think I’ve really grieved as much as I feel I should because I just… Being a business owner, I have to keep going and I have to keep working. The day after this happened at our store, it was… Sunday, they went downtown and did their devastation. And then on Monday night, they came in our area. So Tuesday morning we had a group of fellows come and board up our building and we were open for business and we’ve been continuing to be open for business, even though it’s boarded up. And the love and compassion in this community has been overwhelming, not only to us, but the whole community. People are coming out, coming together as is in showing respect and love towards each other. And it makes me so very proud to be in this community. That’s what do when we have difficulties, we support and help and love. So thank you so much for allowing me to come here and give you a business perspective. We’re lucky. We’re still standing. Thank you. Thank you, Barb. And you know the community loves your story very much and anything we can do to continue to help rebuild you, we will. Thank you very much. Sir, you’re about to hear from one of the sharpest, youngest legal minds in Kenosha. Angela Cunningham, please come up. Your reputation precedes you. Absolutely. Why thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, Mr. Vice President and thank you for joining us here today. You know the reason Kenosha is in the spotlight right now is because the shooting of Jacob Blake. I will never forget that Sunday afternoon. I was watching a live video of someone who was on the scene and trying to figure out what was going on. And I was reading the comments and I saw people commenting about the fact that Jacob Blake had been shot by officers. Then I saw the video of the actual incident. I don’t even think I have the words to describe how I felt when I saw that video. I do remember texting my group of friends and saying, “This is really bad. This is a really bad. There’s going to be protests. There’s going to be rioting.” I knew that right away after watching that video. My mom called me, I have a 20 year old black man for a son, my mom called me shortly after the news got out about what happened because she knows we live in Kenosha and her first thought was, “Is Sean, okay? Is he all right?” I knew he was okay because I knew he was at work. Mr. President… Mr. Vice president, I’m speaking into the Mr. President part. Mr. Vice president, as an attorney, I know legally why a lot of officers who kill Black men and women are not held legally responsible, criminally legally responsible for their actions. Because the law protects them. I recognize that and I know that. I don’t agree with it, but I recognize that and I know that. And I hope that, if and when you are elected president, that that is something that your administration chooses to try to address, because I feel that the law protects a lot of police officers. And I know a lot of those laws are at the state level, but if at the federal level something can be done to incentivize states to not give so much legal protection to police officers who kill Black men and women. I also want to talk, as an attorney I have my own law firm here, ADC Law Office, part of my practice is doing criminal defense work. I’m also a former prosecutor out of Milwaukee. … a former prosecutor out of Milwaukee. So I have been on both sides of the aisle. And what I’ve seen in the criminal courts is unfair treatment between white defendants versus black and brown defendants. There is over policing in our communities. So you have black and brown people who are picked up for, a lot of times, what could be minor things. Then they got a criminal record. Then that criminal record means that they have a stamp on their back that makes it difficult for them to get jobs and more likely to stay involved in the criminal justice system. So then you get a resume that gets built. I would love to see legislation put in place to try to address some of the over policing in communities. I would also like to see some transparency in policing and prosecution and sentencing. Because I sit in courts … Well, I used to before COVID, but sitting in courts all day and I listen to cases and can see what’s going on, I’m able to see the differential treatment in charging and offers that are given by the prosecution and in sentencing that’s given by judges. Anybody who’s not in court every day won’t see that and that data is not readily available. So I would love to see a nationwide effort put in place that requires police departments, district attorney’s offices, and also courts to collect the data about arrests, about charges, about sentencing, about offers that are given so that the light can be shown for people who don’t sit in court all day to see that we’re not just talking, that there really is a discrepancy. And I think that’s the first step that needs to be taken in order to make a difference. And then once we know what the actual numbers are, start putting some legislation in place to try to address some of those discrepancies. Thank you for your listening today. Thank you to our four speakers. Mr. First of all, thank you for giving me the opportunity. And I hope, I don’t know how much time you have after I say a few words, maybe I can hear from more of you as well. But let me respond to a little bit of what I’ve heard so far. First of all, I can make a generic point. The words of a president matter. No matter if they’re good, bad, or indifferent, they matter. No matter how competent or incompetent a president is, they can send the nation to war, they can bring peace, they can make markets rise or fall, and they can do things that I’ve observed can make a difference just by what they say. I got out of law school and I moved back to Delaware. I had a partial scholarship to go away. We didn’t have a law school at the time in Delaware. I went to Syracuse Law School. When I came home from law school, what happened was my last semester, the only two political heroes I ever had, both were assassinated. Dr. King and Bobby Kennedy. Matter of fact, Kennedy was assassinated the day I graduated. I came home and my city is the only city in the United States of America occupied by the military since reconstruction for 10 months. Every single corner with someone, a military person standing with a drawn bayonet. Not a joke, 10 months. I had a job with a good law firm, a well known law firm, one of the oldest law firms in the state. And after awhile, I concluded that I was in the wrong place. They were good people, but I quit and became a public defender. I used to interview my clients in what they call the Northeast Corridor, where Amtrak runs from Washington to New York, that area goes right through my city. And I used to interview clients down in the basement of that train station before they were arraigned. And here I was thinking that … And we had the eighth largest black population of any state in the nation as the percent of population. And we were, to our great shame, a slave state, although we were one of those border states who fought in the side of the North, thank God. But anyway, make a long story short, what happened was I thought black and whites would never be in my city, talk to each other again. And here I was then, literally 40 years later to the month, on January 17th, standing on a platform at that very same train station and looking out over called the East Side, which had been burned to the ground. Literally it had been completely leveled. When things get burned out, they come in and level everything. And then across the Christina River, they call the Third Street Bridge, it was all overwhelmingly 100% African American community. And I was standing on that platform January 17th, waiting for a black man to come 26 miles from Philadelphia to pick me up and take me on a train ride to Washington DC with 10,000 people standing down below cheering. And my son Beau was alive then. He was the attorney general of the state of Delaware at the time. And my daughter, who’s a social worker, ran the largest criminal justice program in the state. And my son, my middle son, who was running the World Food Health Program, The World Food Program USA, the largest program in the world. I call them up and all of a sudden it hit me. Here I was and that whole area has been rebuilt. And third street bridge is still in a little bit of trouble, but things have moved. And I said, “Don’t tell me things can’t change.” I told them about the story. Am I violating social distancing here walking up? I guess I am. Sorry. Yeah. And I said, don’t tell me these can’t change. And I told the story and pointed, reminded them what it was when I was a young attorney. But I made a mistake about something. I thought you could defeat hate. Hate only hides. It only hides. And when someone in authority breathes oxygen under that rock, it legitimizes those folks to come on out, come out in front of the rocks. And I hadn’t planned on running for anything again after my son had died. I was a professor at college and running another program at another college. Until I saw those people coming out of Charlottesville, carrying torches, literally torches coming out of the fields. Close your eyes. Remember what you saw on television. Their veins bulging, their hateful speech, chanting the same antisemitic bile that was chanting in the streets of Germany in the 30s. On top of that, accompanied by white supremacists, Klu Klux Klan. A young woman was killed protesting those folks. And the president of United States was asked. He was asked, “What do you think?” And he said something no president’s ever, ever said. He said, “There are very fine people on both sides.” No president has ever said anything like that. The generic point I’m making is not all his fault, but it legitimizes. It legitimizes the dark side of human nature. And what it did though, it also exposed what had not been paid enough attention to, the underlying racism that is institutionalized in the United States still exists, has existed for 400 years. So what’s happened is that we end up in a circumstance like you had here in Kenosha and have here in Kenosha. But I had a serious operation years ago in neurosurgeon and he gave me a relatively small chance of making it after it was all over. I said, “I’ll be fine.” And he said, “You know what your problem is, Senator?” He said, “You’re a congenital optimist. Well, I think we’ve reached an inflection point in American history. I honest to God believe we have an enormous opportunity now that the screen, the curtain’s been pulled back, and just what’s going on in the country, to do a lot of really positive things. As much as they say that Black Lives Matter has lost some standards since the president has gone on this rant about law and order, et cetera, still you have over 50% of the American people supporting it. It was up to 78. That’s never happened before. People are beginning to see because of COVID who the people are out breaking their necks and risking their lives to keep them safe in their homes. You know that whole definition of a firefighter, God made man and then he made a couple firefighters. You’re all crazy, thanks God. I grew up in a neighborhood you either became a firefighter or a priest. I wasn’t qualify for either. So here I am. But all kidding aside, think of what’s happened. Think of all the people. Who were all those people? You’ve got over 6,000 young dreamers, “dreamers,” the Hispanic community who in fact are on the front lines dealing with COVID. You have all those folks working in a supermarket, stacking the shelves, making five, six, seven bucks an hour and they’re mostly minorities, African Americans, Latinos. People are beginning to figure out who we are as a country. This is not who we are. This is not who we are. So the first point I want to make to you all is I am not pessimistic. I am optimistic about the opportunity if we seize it. I’m going to respond to what each of you had to say. Tim, you talked about this a lot more, then you got to put money behind the solutions. The country’s ready to put that money behind the solutions now. Here’s what I’m proposing is going to happen. You point out a 30% poverty rate among African Americans. You have living wages don’t exist. We’re going to nationalize $ 15 an hour. No one should ever have to work two jobs just to make it. That’s not right in America. Prison reform, there’s a whole lot of forms it takes. But my view is we should turn prison reform, and I’ve been preaching this for the last five years, from prison punishment to reform. So for example, anybody serves their time in prison and they get out, they should be entitled to every single program that exists under the federal government. Why don’t we want them getting a Pell Grant and going to school? Why don’t we want them getting a job and being able to get public housing, housing subsidies? Why don’t we want them qualifying for what used to be called food stamps? But right now, I wrote years ago with a guy named Specter, Senator from Pennsylvania, the Second Chance Act. Because right now we’re in a situation where you get out of prison, and I think you all know this, you get a bus ticket and 25 bucks. By the way, 93% of everybody, 93 out of every 100 prisoners in prison are behind a city jail, a county jail, a state jail, not a federal prison. Barack were I are able to reduce the prison population federally by 38,000 folks. Anybody who gets convicted of a drug crime, not one that is terms of massive selling, but consumption, they shouldn’t go to prison. They should go to mandatory rehabilitation. Instead of building more prisons, I’ve been proposing for some time we build rehabilitation centers. Mandatory. They’ve got to go to mandatory rehab, but it’s not part of their record when they get out if they finish it. Because the point you made, you get a record and it stays with you. Sorry, you can’t get the job because you did the following. Even if it’s a misdemeanor. We shouldn’t be putting anybody in jail for that. We should find ourselves in a situation where housing. Right now in the United States of America, we don’t have the kind of housing funding we had back in our administration earlier before that, even the Republican administrations. No one should have to pay more than 30% of their income to be able to live and have housing, including people on the street. That’s why I proposed a $400 billion program to vastly increase available housing in America. And by the way, it’s not a waste of money. Even the folks on Wall Street pointed out that will increase the GDP, make it grow. People will do better. People do better. Hard as a devil for any of your clients who are black to get an entrepreneurial business loan. All the studies show they’re just as qualified to be able to succeed as anyone else is. Barack and I put together a program that was $1.5 billion that brought $30 billion off the sidelines. And we provide that program for the local small business association. So you can go and apply. Because guess what? If you get a loan, then the private sector says, “Hey, he’s got government backing and we’re going to join him. We’ll get in the deal with him or her.” We’re going to move that to $150 billion. This is fundamentally changing where we go. Okay, I’m giving you too much. I can see you’re about to stand up. Mental health. Mental health is a badly needed commodity right now. That’s why in the Affordable Care Act, we insisted it be treated equally. There’s no difference between a mental health problem and a physical health problem. They’re both related to your health. They should be both covered. You talked about the whole idea of federal support clinics. We need community clinics. You guys are expected to do everything right now. And Barb, you talked about rebuilding. Well, you know what? Let’s get something straight here. Protesting is protesting, my buddy John Lewis used to say. But none of it justifies looting, burning or anything else. So regardless how angry you are, if you loot or you burn, you should be held accountable as someone who does anything else, period. It just cannot be tolerated across the board. And Angela, you talk about the whole issue of sentencing. One of the things that I’ve proposed is we make sure that prosecutors are able to have to list what the option charges were given to a person. For example, if you’re a white guy who can afford a lawyer and you’re charged with a crime, you’re not charged with nine crimes, nine and given nine alternatives and say, “If you plead to the least one, we’re going to put you on probation.” And you have no lawyer or you have a public defender’s getting paid half the federal prosecutor’s getting paid. Public defenders are going to get paid the same of federal public defenders, the same amount as prosecutors are going to get paid. So we have representation. Because once you get that on your record, you’ve got a real problem. Well, two people show for a job. You have that thing you pled to. You weren’t guilty of any of it, but rather than run the risk of going to jail for five years, you plead to get out from under anything, meaning you’d have probation. That happens all the time. That’s why we have to have the federal Department of Justice, which is not much of a Department of Justice right now, have the ability to go and look at the methods that are used by prosecutors in their offices, how they in fact deal with sentencing and what they do. There’s a lot more to say, but I probably already said too much, except that there’s a lot we’re able to do. The public is ready to do these things. I promise you. I promise you. Last piece, education. The idea in the United States of America, your education is determined by your zip code. Title one schools. You all know what a title one school is. Mostly in black and Hispanic neighborhoods, but also poor white neighborhoods where they can’t afford the tax base. Title one schools are unable to get $15 billion a year to make up for the $200 billion gap that exists between them and other school districts, white school districts. Well, guess what? We moved that to $45 billion a year. It means I can put every three, four and five year old in school. In school. We’ve learned a lot in the last eight years. Every major university and prestigious university of the country has pointed out that increases by 58% the chances of that child, no matter what home they came from, will get all the way through all 12 years of school. It also insists that we provide for, right now we have one school psychologist for every 1,505 kids in America. We know now that about 60% of a child’s brain is developed by the time they’ve reached that age and anxiety that exists with children that can be identified early is able to be dealt with. Anxiety. But they don’t do it now because they can’t pick it up. And our situation again, where when you do that, we know that the most at risk generation for the first time in American history is Z generation. They have the greatest degree of anxiety of any generation all the way up the scale, no matter where they are. We’ve also learned … And I’ll end with this. I know you’re getting too antsy. Sit down, man. Okay. [crosstalk 00:40:13] But this is important. Here’s the deal. If you think about it, we’ve finally figured out drug abuse doesn’t cause mental health problems. Mental health problems cause drug abuse. And if you don’t detect the anxiety in children early and deal with it and treat it, you increase exponentially the prospect that they’re going to in fact find themselves susceptible to what’s happening in the community. The generic point I’m making is there’s so much we can do. So much we can do. And we can do it just by eliminating the tax cut for the top one 10th of 1%, which is $1,350,000,000,000 that’s done nothing to help anybody. 19 corporations making a billion dollars a piece don’t pay a single penny in taxes. I’m not wanting to punish anybody, but everyone should pay a fair share. I can lay out for you … I won’t now because they’ll shoot me. But here’s the deal. I pay for every single thing I’m proposing without raising your taxes one penny. If you make less than 400 grand, you’re not going to get a penny taxed and you’re going to get a tax cut if you make under $125,000. So it’s not, “We can’t do this.” We haven’t been willing to do this. But I think the public’s ready. Now I’ll do whatever you tell me, boss. You are the boss. I know when my dad would tell me to sit down, I sat down. So I’m good. I’m good. I think what you heard here was strength, experience and empathy. And what we do know is that Vice President Biden, you and Kamala Harris have the leadership and strength to restore faith and healing in this country. We appreciate you very much. … and appreciate you very much. We’re going to continue the community conversations because I’m sure you have more to hear from our community. [inaudible 00:42:18] bragging about you. Hello, my name is Portia Bennett. I’m just going to be honest, Mr. Biden. I was told to go off this paper, but I can’t. You need the truth, and I’m part of the truth. I was born here, raised here, first to eighth grade class at the school that was named after his mother. So I have to give you the truth of the people. And the truth of the matter is we are heavily angry. Not angry as to where people say, “Oh, they’re protesting.” There’s a difference between a protestor and a rioter, a very big difference. We protest to get our voices heard. We protest to show that not just Blacks are tired of what’s going on. Because you can see there are Blacks, whites, Muslims, Chinese, Hispanic that are out there. We came together to help get this community together as well because we live here and we want it to stay the way we’ve always had it. But the changes that we want have to be more in effect. We hear so many people saying, “Oh, we’re going to give you this, we’re going to give you that.” But we have yet to see action. And I was always raised to go off action and not words, because you’ll be let down every single time. And the action we want are hold these officers accountable to the same crimes that we get held accountable to. If I was that officer, I would be in the Kenosha County Jail right now. If I was these officers who commit these crimes, because if a medical examiner does their job and says, “Oh, I’m ruling it homicide,” that’s murder. We walk somewhere, automatically it’s, “You fit the description.” We wear something, automatically it’s, “Oh, you’re a bad person.” I’m only 31. And I’ve seen enough within these last two years to say, “I’m tired.” I’m a mother. My oldest is 13, my twins are nine. I do this because I want their future to be better than what I have right now, because my present is not good. But I speak because I want the truth heard, and I speak for the people in this city because I live in this city, and I’m out here with these people. A lot of people won’t tell the truth, but I’m telling the truth. It’s not what a lot of people think it is for us. We want the same exact rights as others. We want to be treated just like everyone else. A lot of us get denied jobs because we mark that box as Black or African American knowing we are overly qualified for that position. People come in and tear down our houses in our neighborhoods instead of fixing them up and making them better. And now we’re all pushed to one side of town. Gentrification has to stop as well. We can’t get that if someone with that voice can’t put that into effect. That’s all we’re asking. We want the same treatment. We’re not asking, “Oh, put us above anybody,” we’re not saying we matter more than anybody, none of that. But for so many decades, we’ve been shown we don’t matter. And right now, we just want someone who’s actually going to show and put that action in. There’s a lot of stuff we want done. And being someone who is out here who I literally live directly behind this church. I know the pastor. I come over and help with the food pantry some days. So I know it, I see it, I live it. Others who don’t see it and live it can’t tell you the truth. They can’t really give you the in depth things that we’re going through out here as Black and brown people. So I’m telling you. There’s way more that we want done, and it didn’t just start with Jacob. But we want change. We want change. So I thank you for coming to hear me. Excuse me. Thank you, Mr. Vice President, for being here, listening. The spotlight’s been on our town. We talked about Sunday, what happened Sunday. And I feel like that was years ago. And when I’m walking out there and talking to my constituents and I’m talking to my neighbors and I’m talking to my friends and my family, I hear their pain. The 10th district, the city of Kenosha, did not suffer the same destruction that other parts of the city experienced. But like I spoke to Senator Baldwin, there’s a hurt in my section of town. There is a pain in my section of town. Mr. Blake was shot two blocks from my house. But we speak about how we feel then, the despair, and the anger, and all of those things. But I also want to tell you about the humanity that’s coming out of these things. We know that someone came here to take a victory lap. We know that someone came here to show division. We know that someone came here not to help us. But the people surrounding the family decided, “We’re not going to show that picture to the world. We’re going to show them something different.” And you saw a block party happen right there where Mr. Blake was shot. You saw people celebrating life. You saw kids playing in bounce houses. You saw services being provided to the community. And this was put together in about a 24 hour period. And I’d love to sit up here and tell you I took credit for it, and I didn’t. It just happened organically with the people that are around them. That’s the spirit in Kenosha, and that’s the thing that gives me hope. What gives me hope about your presidency is that we can stop talking the cynicism. When we go out there in that marketplace of voting, we’ll have a real idea. We’ll give people, I don’t want to use the other guy’s phrase there, but we’ll give them hope. And that’s so important. The things I’m going to need in my district in particular, it’s going to be more of those soft skills. There’s definitely the jobs and economic development and all the things that the other speakers have spoke on, that’ll help in my district immensely. But to restore faith in the system, that’s going to be very hard, very difficult. To restore faith in the process, that’s going to be very difficult. But when we know the man at the top, yourself, is speaking truth and speaking an honest truth, you’re going to make our work here in Kenosha a lot better, and I’m looking forward to that day. And I just again want to thank you. [inaudible 00:51:16]. Oh. First of all, I’m going to just stay seated, make it informal. Portia, the things that I talked about here that we have to do didn’t start with even back to Eric Garner, “I can’t breathe.” Been proposing these for a long time. I mean, literally for years. And the one thing I think we have to acknowledge, my mom used to have an expression. My mom would say, “You want to know me? Come walk in my shoes a mile.” Well, even though I’ve been involved with the African American community and the civil rights movement since I’ve been a junior in high school, desegregating movie theaters and the like, I can’t understand what it’s like to walk out the door or send my son out the door, or my daughter, and worry about just because they’re Black, they may not come back. I can intellectually understand it, but I can’t feel it. I just spent an hour or more with the family as I got off the airplane. Had an opportunity to spend some time with Jacob on the phone. He’s out of ICU. We spoke for about 15 minutes. His brother and two sisters, his dad and his mom on the telephone. And I spoke to them a lot before, but we spent some time together with my wife. And he talked about how nothing was going to defeat him, how whether he walked again or not, he was not going to give up. We talked about a Psalm and my [inaudible 00:53:31] based on the 23rd Psalm. “May he raise you up with eagle’s wings and bury you on the breath of dawn until we … And keep you and hold you in the palm of his hand until we meet again. Well, I think, Alderman, what’s been unleashed with a lot of people is they understand that fear doesn’t solve problems. Only hope does. And if you give up hope, you might as well surrender. There’s no real option. And as we talked, I listened to his mom. She was on the phone. She wasn’t with Jacob, she was in the same location. And as I said, his dad, his son, his brother, two sisters, and a family lawyer, two family lawyers were there. And what I came away with was the overwhelming sense of resilience and optimism that they have about the kind of response they’re getting. His mom talked about, we asked, my wife asked to say a prayer. And his mom said a prayer. She said, “I’m praying for Jacob, but I’m praying for the policemen as well. I’m praying that things change. If you think a little bit about where we are right now, it’s been a terrible, terrible wake up call that’s gotten the rest of the nation to realize that the confluence of three things. One, the COVID crisis. Two, and we didn’t have to have over six million people contract COVID. Over 186,000 dead and climbing. If we had acted, if we’d had just acted. It’s been pointed out by the University of Columbia law school that if he had acted just one week earlier, 37,000 more people would have been alive. If he acted two weeks earlier, 51,000. Maybe 31 and 57 or 51 and … But the point is over 80,000 people would still be alive. You have to take responsibility if you’re a leader, a president. Instead of saying, “I’m not responsible, didn’t happen on my watch. I take no responsibility. I think the country is much more primed to take responsibility because they now have seen what you see. But you don’t experience it the same way you do, Portia, because they’re not a bright young Black woman with two kids here, is it two or three children that you … Three children that you have to worry about. But there are changes that are taking place in the country. And one of the problems is that, and look, this is not about me. It’s really not about me. But if we have four more years, we’re going to have four years of the exact same thing, only it’s going to impact us for a couple generations. And the public kind of understands that now. And I think they’re so ready to do so many things. They either fully unaware of or aware of but never registered with them before. Or they just have seen things that they hadn’t seen before. When Dr. King, when he said, I know that’s ancient history, you weren’t even born. But when Bull Connor, I was in grade school when Bull Connor took those fire hoses and dogs on those Black women going to church in their Sunday best and little kids having the skin ripped off them by these high powered fire hoses, he thought he was putting a wooden stake in the heart of the civil rights movement. But in other parts of the country where they heard about this but didn’t believe it ever happened, everybody turned on a black and white TV. And they saw it. Said, “Oh my god.” Dr. King said it was a second emancipation. It got the Voting Rights Act, it got the Civil Rights Act. Didn’t get us all the way there, but made progress. And that young man stood there for eight minutes and I think it was 43 seconds watching, watching Floyd die, having his face pressed up against that curb. People not only United States, but all around the world said, “Oh my God. It really, really happens.” When you had a man of his size and physicality calling for his mom, it struck a nerve that hadn’t been struck before. It’s awful it has to happen. But I think we’re at one of those moments. We have this opportunity. If we don’t let up, we don’t let up. There’s a reason why this administration doesn’t want to talk about it, wants to only talk about dividing the country and about law and order. They don’t want to talk about all those people who have died from COVID. They don’t want to talk about the fact that almost a million people again file for unemployment, don’t have jobs. They don’t want to talk about the fact that you have tens of thousands of businesses closing, maybe for good. They don’t want to talk about the fact that the Congress passed legislation, Heroes Act, to provide money for states to be able to keep firefighters on the job, teachers on the job, first responders on the job, et cetera. They don’t want to talk about that because they don’t want to do it. They don’t feel it’s their obligation. So they’re trying to divert us the attention it’d have. If I get elected president, I promise you there will be a national commission on policing out of the White House where I’ll bring everyone to the table, including police chiefs, including civil rights activists, including the NAACP, including the African, the Latino community. We’re going to sit down there and we’re going to work it out. Because a significant portion of the police are decent people, but no one, there’s a lot of bad folks in every organization. There’s not a whole lot of people that want to speak up, be the odd man out or odd woman out, no matter what outfit you work with. And so we got to give a chance to change things. And we can. There is not a single solitary reason in the world. Why? Why, as I said, we shouldn’t be in a position that everybody … Hey, that’s my wife, Jill. Hey, Jilly. I’m Jill’s husband, actually. But I guess I should cut to the chase here. We’re in a situation now where we can not let up. We can not let up. Violence in any form is wrong. The idea that this president continues to try to divide us, gives succor to the white supremacists, talks about how there’s really good people on both sides, talks in ways that are just absolutely, I’ve never used this regarding the president before, not only incorrect, but immoral and just simply wrong, simply wrong. And the one concern I have, and I understand it, is that people are going to be so frustrated, particularly in the communities that need the help the most, need to be treated most clearly and equally, are going to say, “It’s not worth it at all. I’m not going to vote. Guy was a very good friend of mine. Talked to him two days before he died. John Lewis. As John said, the only answer is to vote. It’s the only answer. [inaudible 01:02:35], but otherwise nothing else works in a democracy. It doesn’t work. The not so good guys win when we don’t vote. I understand. I really do have a sense of the frustration. … America set its mind to something it’s never, never, never, never, never failed. When we put our minds to and we do it together, never. We’ve gone through Wars and pestilence, plague. We’ve gone through a lot, and we’re finally now getting to the point, we’re going to be addressed the original sin of this country, 400 years old. It’s the original sin, slavery, and all the vestiges of it. I’m not saying in four years, and this is not about a campaigning, I can’t say if tomorrow God made me President, I can’t guarantee you everything gets solved in four years. But I guarantee you one thing, it’ll be a whole heck of a lot better. We’ll move a lot further down the road. People fear that which is different. We got to, for example, why in God’s name don’t we teach history in history classes. A black man invented the light bulb, not a white guy named Edison. Okay? There’s so much. Anybody know these things? Because we don’t teach him. We’ve got to give people facts, teach them what’s out there, the idea. I just spent time with a number of the NFL players and basketball… And excuse me, basketball players, including Steph Curry. These folks are making a difference. Now it’s not about fame or glory, because they have brothers themselves. Fathers who’ve been beat up. Who’ve been brutalized just because they’re African-Americans. They’re about the time. They’re saying, I’m saying, “Enough is enough. I think there is a chance for a real awakening here. And the point is, I don’t think we have any alternative, but to fight. I don’t think we have any alternative, but to fight back. [inaudible 01:05:28] alternative than just go tell the truth, just tell the truth. And a concluding comment I’ll make is, there’s a lot of folks who thought that, well, the president’s made great strides with his law and order strides here. That boy, after his convention, he really made inroads. He hasn’t, not at all. [inaudible 01:05:57] it should give you a little bit of, confidence in the American people, they ain’t buying it. With all the millions and millions and millions of dollars being spent, they’re not buying it. But we got to do more than them not buy it. We got to be honest with them and say, “You got to step up. You got to step up. We got to do a lot more, a lot more than we’ve done.” Because this is the first chance we’ve had in a generation, in my view, to deal and cut another slice off institutional racism toward getting the place where change is. And by the way, the main reason why I’m optimistic because of your generation, black, white, Hispanic, and Asian American. Did you ever think you’d turn on a TV… You’re much younger than I am, but you’re a little older than she is. You ever think you’d turn on the TV, and roughly two out of three ads would be biracial couples selling a product. That never would have happened in the ’50s, ’60s, ’70s, ’80s, ’90s. The generation, this generation, is a different generation. They’re the least prejudice, the most optimistic, the best educated, the most desirable of change of any generation. So we can’t let them down. Those of us are a lot older. We got to join and join them and do it now. Again, I thank you. As I said, I really am optimistic. I promise you, win or lose, I’m going to go down fighting. I’m going to go down fighting for racial equality, equity across the board. We hold these truths to be self evident that all men and women are created equal endowed by their creator. Well, that may be what your birthright was, but it’s very different than actually being treated equally, being treated the same. Everything from black mortality rates in pregnancy, straight through to educational opportunities and everything in between, but the country’s ready. And if they’re not, it doesn’t matter because there are certain things I ain’t going to change. There are certain things worth losing over, and this is something worth losing over if we have to, but we’re not going to lose. Thank you very much, sir. Round of applause for him. Those were truly, truly unifying words in a community that needs healing and unification. We’ll go down fighting with you. We’re not going to go down. Definitely not going down. But let me say thing if I could, before I bring it up Pastor Monroe Mitchell is the gentleman in me, sir, I’d be remiss if I didn’t welcome the Doctor, Jill Biden. Ladies and gentlemen, please let’s welcome Dr. Jill Biden the appropriate way. Thank you. Welcome to Kenosha. Thank you very much. Pastor Monroe Mitchell, please come forward. Thank you, Tim. Thank you Mr. Biden for coming out. Thank you, Pastor Barker for holding this great community event, this town hall meeting. And thank you to all the speakers too, that came forth. There was so much said. And I want to thank you too, Mr. Biden, for reminding us how important optimism is. We deal with so much negativity. We deal with so many problems. We need to focus on being positive, being optimist, in dealing with the solutions. So like I said, so much has been said in I’m just grateful to even be invited to this. So anyway, let us stand as we get ready to dismiss in prayer. Father, we thank you once again. I thank you for your grace and for your mercy, your goodness and your kindness. Thank you, dear God for allowing us to come together in a spirit of oneness. Thank you for allowing Mr. Biden to take time out of his busy schedule. And thank you, dear God for allowing us to bring some issues to the table. And father, I pray right now, dear God that you take out hatred, that you move out hatred from our community and replace it with love. Father, I pray sincerely and seriously, dear God, that you remind us each and every day that we can too be resilient and have tenacity, and move forward away from this destruction. And Lord God, I pray that you allow this community to heal, Kenosha. I pray, dear God, that you bless Kenosha, that you bring us back together, that you tear down the walls that separate us because of race and other issues. And I pray, dear God, that you open up the channels of communication that much more between your people. And father this is not something that just started recently. This is something that’s been going on for awhile. So we pray dear God, that you, once again, continue to protect Kenosha, continue to protect Wisconsin, continue to protect this country. And also continue to protect this world. We lift up the Blake family today, Jacob Blake, we pray and ask that you touch him miraculously and triumphantly with his illness, with his pain and with the suffering. We pray dear God for his family, as they go through this healing process, as they deal with all of these things in the media and situations with the police department and so forth. But father, I won’t stop there. I’ll pray and ask that you touch the Kenosha police department. For those that are doing the great job that’s needed to be done in the community. And I pray that you’ll touch the hearts of those that are not. The hearts of those that may allow racism to come in, and bigotry to come in, and hatred to come in, for we know that some of it is learned behavior; it’s unfortunate. But we pray father that she’ll allow this community to work together. As so many has said today, we need to rebuild. We need to reconstruct. But I pray father, that we were rely on you as our ultimate source of strength. So Lord God, as we get ready to leave this place, only dismiss us from this place, but never from your presence. Now may the grace of God rest, rule, and reside in each and every one of our hearts today and forevermore, as we’ll give you all the praise, the honor, and the glory that you so rightfully deserve and much, much more. And father I pray as none other than a servant who stands behind the cross. And I pray dear God, in the name of Jesus Christ, my Lord and my savior, and let everyone say, “Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Thank you, pastor Monroe. This concludes the program. We’re going to ask that everyone, please stay where you are. State staff will take over. We’re going to take a photo and they will direct traffic. Before we begin into that process, I’d like to thank Pastor Barker for hosting us here today, and Dr. Jill Biden and Vice President, Joe Biden for being here. We wish you well. We thank you for bringing the unifying force to Kenosha. This is a community of immigrants and blacks, and Latinos, Germans, Polish Italians. We work together. We’re hurting right now. We know our challenge is to dig deep in our inner soul to heal our own community. We look forward to your leadership and the leadership of Senator Kamala Harris to restore faith in this community and faith in this country. God bless you. Dr. Amen [inaudible 01:14:04]. [crosstalk 01:14:05] for participants in the room, we’re going to ask that you come up. But let’s do one row at a time, so we can keep people safe. [crosstalk 01:14:25] have you stay where you are. [crosstalk 01:14:26] turn around, perfect. And then turn around. Easy. Even easier. Fabulous. I love that. So you both will just turn around and then we’re good. Yeah. You just stay right here. We’re going to have everyone turn around in the pew. [crosstalk 00:11:29]. Yes, sir. And then Adam, waving his hand."
"101","09-04-20"," Good afternoon folks. Sorry I’m a little late. I was a mesmerized. I was walking out of the office, that listening to an interview of former General Barry McCaffrey and Bill Cohen, former Secretary of Defense. Before I begin, I want to speak a little bit to what they talked about and the revelations about President Trump’s disregard for our military and our veterans. Quite frankly, if what is written in the Atlantic is true, it’s disgusting. At affirms what most of us believe to be true, that Donald Trump is not fit to do the job of President, to be the Commander in Chief. The President reportedly said, and I emphasize reportedly, said that those who sign up to serve, instead of doing something more lucrative are suckers. Let me be real clear. When my son was an Assistant US Attorney and he volunteered to go to Kosovo, when the war is going on as a civilian, he wasn’t a sucker. When my son volunteered and joined the United States military, as the Attorney General and went to Iraq for a year, won the Bronze Star and other commendations, he wasn’t a sucker. The service men and women he served with, particularly those who did not come home, were not losers. If these statements are true, the President should humbly apologize to every Gold Star Mother and Father and every Blue Star Family that he’s denigrated and insulted. Who the heck does he think he is? Is it true? Well, we’ve heard from his own mouth, his characterizations of an American hero, John McCain as a loser in 2015. Donald Trump said he was not a war hero. I like people who weren’t captured. Well good for him. And his dismissal of the traumatic brain injury suffered by troops serving in Iraq, as mere headaches, not too long ago. He stood by failing, failing to take action or even raise the issue with Vladimir Putin while the Kremlin puts bounties on the heads of American troops in Afghanistan. It’s a sacred duty and you’re tired of hearing me say this. Those of you who’ve been covering me for years know. I get in trouble for saying it, but I’m going to say it again. We have many obligations as a government. We only have one truly sacred obligation. Equipped and support those who we send into harm’s way, care for their families while they’re gone, and care for them when they are home. That’s the only truly sacred obligation the government has. Duty, honor, country. These are values that drive our service members. It’s an all voluntary outfit. President Trump is demonstrated he has no sense of service, no loyalty to any cause other than himself. If I have the honor of being the next commander in chief, I will ensure that our American heroes know I’ll have their backs, honor their sacrifice. And those who’ve been injured will be in military parades. I’m always cautioned not to lose my temper. This may be as close as I come in this campaign. Just a marker of how deeply President Trump and I disagree about the role of the president of the United States of America. The August jobs report came out this morning. And I’m grateful for everyone who found work again and found a glimmer of hope that brings them back from the edge, but there is real cause for concern as well. The pace of the job gains in August was slower than July, significantly slower than in May and June. More and more temporary layoffs are turning into permanent layoffs. 28 million people filed for unemployment. And after six months in the pandemic, we’re less than halfway back to where we were with 11 million, 11.5 million Americans not getting their jobs back. We’re still down 720, 000 manufacturing jobs. In fact, Donald Trump may be the only president of modern history to leave office with fewer jobs than when he took office. I’ve talked to a lot of real working people, ask them. They feel like they’re being left behind. Ask them, how do they feel about the economy coming back? You’ll find they don’t feel it. And that’s why I’m here today, to thank Paul Calistro and his team for hosting us at West End Neighborhood House here in Wilmington. Paul, your continued tradition of doing God’s work through this community is important. It’s been around for more than 130 years. Through pandemics, wars, depressions. West End has been here for generations of people who are just looking for a chance, not a handout. Just a fair shot at a good job, a safe place to live, and a better life to pass down to their kids. This is a special place for the Biden family. My daughter, Ashley, a social worker, was a caseworker here helping young people who are aging out of foster care. When my son was the Attorney General, Beau came here, right here, to learn more about job training programs for those working toward a GED and a certificate for a good paying job. When I was senator and vice president, there were plenty of economists I had around me to talk about every aspect of the economy. But I always think about the people who walked through the doors here. Working people, white, Black, brown, Latino. What are they doing? Are they okay? I knew if they’re okay, they walk through these doors, the economy was doing okay. If they weren’t okay, we weren’t doing well. That’s what we should be thinking about is this latest jobs report. But the report reinforces the worst fears and painful truths. The economic inequities that began before the downturn have only worsened under this failed presidency. When the crisis started, we all hope for a few months of a shutdown would be followed by a rapid economic turnaround. No one thought they’d lose their job for good or see small businesses shut down en masse. But that kind of recovery requires leadership, leadership we didn’t have and still don’t have. And as a result, economists are starting to call this recession a K-shaped recession, which is a fancy phrase for what’s wrong with everything about Trump’s presidency. The K means those at the top are seeing things go up. And those in the middle and below are seeing things go down and get worse. It’s no surprise because at root of this is the fact that Trump has mismanaged the COVID crisis. And that’s why it’s a K-shaped pandemic. First, the president’s chaotic mismanagement of the pandemic is still holding us back. Compared to other major industrial countries in Europe and Asia, during the pandemic, our unemployment rate is still more than double, while other nations have only gone up by half. Why? Because the president has botched the COVID response, botched it badly. I’ve said from the beginning we can’t deal with an economic crisis until you beat the pandemic. You can’t have an economic comeback when almost 1000 Americans die each day from COVID, when the death toll was reached about 200,000, when more than six million Americans have been infected, when million more worry about getting sick and dying, and schools and businesses try to reopen. We all know it didn’t have to be this bad. It didn’t have to be this bad to begin with if the president just did his job, if he just took the virus seriously early on in January and February as it spread around the globe, if he just took the steps we needed back in March and April, institute widespread testing and tracing to control the virus, if he provided clear national scientific-based guidance to state and local authorities, if he just set a good example like social distancing and wearing a mask. It’s not too much to ask. It’s almost like he doesn’t care. It doesn’t affect him because it doesn’t affect him or his class of friends. Anyone with a big enough checkbook can get rapid tests on demand. If you don’t, you might have to wait in line for hours and wait for weeks to get your result, if you can get them at all. You have the kind of job where you can work from a laptop at home remotely, risking getting COVID is very small at work. This job report shows that 37 million people reported teleworking in August. But if you work in an assembly line or check out counter or a meat packing plant or drive a truck or deliver packages, you’re at much greater risk. And the job report shows that more than 27 million workers reported that they couldn’t work or lost hours because their employer had to close or lost business due to the pandemic. If you can hire a private tutor or have a live-in childcare, you can balance being a parent and remote schooling. If you can’t, you have to do your job and be a teacher all at once. Jill and I have held briefings on reopening school safety two days ago, asking the question as we hear so many parents call and ask us, educators as well who feel like they’re in an impossible situation. What are they supposed to do with our children when the president has made it so hard for schools to reopen safely? What’s the alternative when it’s devastating to keep them isolated from their friends and their support systems? I also said earlier this week, to the shock of many, we have lost more cops this year to COVID than on patrol. Just a reminder how an already dangerous job, law enforcement, has gotten more dangerous because of Trump’s mismanagement. What may be just as shocking is many other jobs have also become dangerous due to COVID. Being a healthcare worker is now more dangerous than ever. We’ve lost hundreds of them this year because they weren’t protected from COVID on the job. Being a meat packer is more dangerous than ever. So many have died due to getting COVID at work. Work for waitresses and waiters and transit workers all have become more dangerous, with so many dying of COVID. Ladies and gentlemen, no matter what he says or what he claims, you are not safer in Donald Trump’s America. You’re not safe in Donald Trump’s America where people are dying at a rate last seen when Americans were fighting in World War II. Donald Trump’s malpractice during this pandemic has made being a working American a life or death work. And while there is a disproportionate impact on Black, Latino, and Asian Americans and Native Americans working class communities, white working class communities are being hit hard as well. Opioid deaths, for example, are up during the pandemic. Another crisis that Trump continues to all but ignore. In the meantime, Trump and his friends have strong views about what the rest of America should do. Quote, “Cut unemployment benefits to force people to go back to their jobs,” end of quote. “Defund social security and eliminate Obamacare in the middle of a pandemic,” end of quote. Reopen public schools without resources or guidance. Reopen main street business without protection for workers so corporations can continue to soar. Second and similarly, the economic pain remains unrelenting for millions of working people of every race and background aren’t getting relief they need. Meanwhile, wealthy are doing just fine, some better than ever. This divergence in fortunes is unique to any recession in recent memory. And the painful truth is we just have a president who just doesn’t see it. He doesn’t feel it. He doesn’t understand. He just doesn’t care. He thinks if the stock market is up, then everything’s fine. If his wealthy friends and donors are doing well, then everything’s doing well. If corporations see their valuations rising, then they must be hiring. But the best economists know what I know. I have learned growing up in Scranton and Claymont, Delaware up the road, places where folks aren’t invested in the market like wealthy Americans. A measure of our economic success is the quality of life of the American people. And if your stocks soar as families teeter on the brink of hunger and homelessness and our president calls that success, what does that say about what he values? When you see the world in such a narrow prism, it’s no wonder he doesn’t see nearly 30 million Americans on unemployment, one in six small businesses that closed right now. He doesn’t understand what life is like for people walking by their boarded up shops, educators afraid that doing their job, that job they love, will bring the virus home to the people they love, or of parents searching for health insurance now that the furlough has turned into a layoff. It’s no wonder he doesn’t see the single mom forced to wait in the three hour food line so for the first time in her life, so she can feed her family because she’s now part of the one in six households with children that don’t have enough to eat. … that we’re doing better, to keep it up and not notice that this remains the worst economic situation since the Great Depression and our country face the historic divergence in our way of life. Which gets me to my third and final point and what the American people really need to understand, all the pain and suffering stems from President Trump’s failure to lead, his sheer inability and willingness to bring people together, he likes to sign executive orders, actions for photo ops, but they’re ill-conceived and could do more harm than good. He says, “Protecting renters from eviction,” that’s what he’s doing, but he’s not giving them any support to pay the rent when it comes due. Millions of Americans, all will be left with a terrible choice between eviction and living in the streets or paying back rent they simply don’t have when there was an answer offered and rejected. He says he’s continuing to provide enhanced unemployment insurance payments, but he cut the amount that everyone on it receive, leaves them on the edge when it runs out in a few weeks or sooner. He should be doing his job of calling congressional leaders together immediately to get a deal and deliver real results for the American people. This is the first president in the middle of a crisis I’ve never seen has called Congress into the Oval Office. If I were president, that’s what I’d do and I’d get it done like previous presidents. Rentals, food, unemployment assistance, tens of millions struggling Americans, student loan reliefs, small business support, and aid to schools and state governments that are going bankrupt. And as long as this pandemic and the economic catastrophe persist, no one should have their water or power cut off because they can’t afford to pay the bill. Bottom line, Mr. President, do your job, get off your golf course and out of the sand bunker, call the leaders together in the Oval Office, sit with them and make a deal. Make a deal that delivers for working Americans and eases their anxiety and pain. In July, I laid out my Build Back Better plan for an economy that works for everyone. Over the next three weeks I’ll be laying out the sharp contrast my plan has with the president’s non-plans. I’ll be asking American people three basic questions, who can handle a pandemic? Who can keep their promises? And who cares about and will fight for working families? Like the people here at West End, throughout this pandemic, they found their way to keep the center open safely and provide for critical services. No one here has been laid off. They adjusted their spaces for social distancing. They started a lending program to help local businesses, hair salons, and other small businesses. They continue their childcare services, which is critical for so many working families. By pure courage, heart, and grit, they never give up and they never give in and they pursue the full promise for America. That’s the story of the people of this community and this country, that’s who we are. Give ordinary American just half a chance and they never let the country down, they’ll do extraordinary things, they’ll never let us down unlike the current president. And unlike the current president I won’t let you down either, that’s what this election is about, helping people unite, get together, move this country back in the direction that we can be, there’s nothing beyond our capacity, nothing, if we just do it together. Thank you all, and I now take your questions. I guess… Are you calling on people or how am I… I don’t have a list, so you go ahead and call. [crosstalk 00:32:19]. Isaac. Thank you, sir. This morning in reference to that article in The Atlantic, in a call convened by your campaign, Khizr Khan said that the comments demonstrated that President Trump’s life is a testament to selfishness and that his soul is that of a coward. I’m going to try to be measured in my response. If it’s true, and based on other things he said I believe the article is true, I’d ask you all the rhetorical question, how do you feel? How would you feel if you had a kid in Afghanistan right now? How would you feel if you lost a son, daughter, husband, wife? How would you feel, for real? I know that’s not your job to express that feeling, but you know in your heart, you know in your gut, it’s deplorable. As I’ve said many times, I’ll say again, these folks are the backbone of America, they’re the heart, the soul, the grit, that’s what patriotism is about. I’ve probably… I’ve just never been as disappointed in my whole career with a leader that I’ve worked with president or otherwise, that if the article is true and it appears to be based on other things he’s said, it is absolutely damnable, it is a disgrace. Let’s get on a somewhat related topic. I’ve been a big supporter of mental health, I’d recommend that people who believe it maybe should take advantage while it still exists in the Affordable Care Act. It’s bizarre, totally bizarre. And now, have you guys found that planeload of people in uniforms, and weapons, and flying around? I mean, have you found them yet? Is there anybody even from… By the way, I respect conservatism and liberal points of view in the press. Anybody found that plane? What in God’s name are we doing? Look at how it makes us look around the world, it’s mortified, it’s embarrassing, and it’s dangerous. If the president doesn’t know better, which I… He has to know better, and my Lord we’re in much more trouble than I ever thought we were. It’s bizarre. And this is a case where I’ve been surprised, pleased, but surprised with folks I’ve had political arguments with like the former governor of Michigan coming out and endorse me, all the Republicans are endorsing me, they’ll reach where, that this can’t go on, I mean, this cannot go on. It’s a deconstruction of a democratic system, they know it. So, I just… I’ll conclude with what you heard me say times before, the words of a president matter, even a lousy president, it gives succor, it gives encouragement to people who are spouting irrational views that no one has even close to ever presuming or showing ever existed. And it’s done for a simple reason, from the very beginning he’s understood the only way he could win the first time and can win this time is he fundamentally divides the nation, puts the nation… Divides us so we’re at each other’s throats, that’s not who we are. Thank you, sir. [inaudible 00:37:44]. Thank you, Mr. Vice President. Last night, President Trump mocked you for wearing a mask and said that this is a sign that you must have some ‘big issues’. He says this even though he knows that according to scientists and public health officials, wearing masks saves lives. I wonder if you worry that this kind of language that comes from the President of the United States could deter some Americans who are tuning into him to not wear masks. Well, I wear [inaudible 00:38:24] is a big issue, I’m a smart fellow, I listen to scientists, this is not a game, life and death. Reports that we’re going to have maybe… There’s some reports that say another 100,000 dead, as many as a 100,000 dead, more by the end of the year. I mean, I don’t get it. I mean, I just… Anyway, it’s hard to respond to something so idiotic. Okay. Yes, I have. I’ve been tested once with a deep test, and I’m going to continue to be testing on a regular basis. Okay, next question. No, it’s not consistent with the briefings I’ve received. And he’s a lousy enough attorney general, but he’s a really bad intelligence officer. It’s not consistent because you believe [crosstalk 00:39:51]. Because I believe what I’ve been told, and you all know it. I mean, look, it’s… You even have office like Facebook taking somewhat… Look, it’s just… There are a lot of countries around the world, I think, would be happy to see our elections destabilized, but the one who’s working the hardest, most consistently, and never has led up is Russia. And again, it’s unfair to say to you guys, but ask yourself the rhetorical question, what is he so afraid of Vladimir Putin [inaudible 00:12:30]? I mean, what’s the problem? I mean, nothing, it’s almost obsequious. I mean… Anyway, I just want to make it clear, I believe any country that engages in any activity to delegitimize or impact on American elections is a direct violation of our sovereignty, and if I am President of United States, there will be a response. Great, next question. Thank you. [inaudible 00:41:15]. She’s been on the road, she’s out herself. The role is that, just like when Barack and I campaigned, we try to cover as much territory as we could, and both of us out campaigning. She is an incredibly competent candidate, she is doing a great job. There will be times where together, but there’s a lot of territory to cover. I talk with her almost every day, I speak with her, we work together, and I have great confidence in her. There’s nothing about not campaigning together, it’s about being able to cover more territory. … About not campaigning together. It’s about being able to cover more territory. Well, what they’re doing is they’re going to do it on a regular basis because everyone on my service detail and people who come into the house with me, they’re all tested. I just, “Yes, sir.” Show up and put my head back, when they tell me. I imagine it will be sometime this week. I just don’t know, but it will be a regular basis. Thank you. Go ahead. Thank you, sir. Let me ask you about another thing the president said last night. He once again, suggested to his supporters that they should consider voting twice, if they’re in one of those states that can allow you to request an absentee ballot. So you fill that out and then go try voting again in person. State officials have said it’s a felony in some cases, just curious what you make of it. It is a felony. It would be felony here in the state of Delaware. Look, I mean, how many times does this president have to suggest things and say things where you all, don’t just write, he’s a fraud. Not an opinion. Maybe we should delay the election. Maybe we should write in ballots are fraudulent, not a single bit of evidence. And I think it’s all designed to create so much chaos that no matter what the outcome of the election is that is thrown up in the air. That must be his reason because he says, and does things that no other president that I’m aware of in American history has ever done. And we all go, “Well, here’s another ridiculous, illegal, inappropriate thing he said, but he says so many of them, it doesn’t matter.” It just undermines the legitimacy of our democratic process and it’s dangerous. You said today is the angriest you’ve been as a presidential candidate, but you said you’re trying to restrain yourself. Aren’t there a lot of people out there who are supporting you or inclined to not vote for the president, who would say, “Why isn’t Joe Biden, angrier about all of this. Because presidents United States should be presidential and should lead by example, as well as make clear exactly where they stand. Getting down in the gutter like the president does saying things that I’d be inclined, if we were behind a barn somewhere, it’d be a different thing. But that’s not the job of a president. The job of a president sets an example. My anger is real because I must tell you, I carry and I deliberately didn’t bring it with me today. The Delaware National Guard had a pin made up. That’s a gold star that was made up for my son, Beau, who didn’t die in the field. And I always carry it with me and I didn’t carry it today because I was worried that if I focus too much on it, that I would engage in some of the kind of language the president’s used. I mean, but I just think it is sick. It is deplorable. It is so un-American. It is so unpatriotic. And then watching him this morning while I was shaving and the TV on talking about he never said anything like that. He honored John McCain. He’s the reason why flags are flown at half mast. Oh, wasn’t that noble of him. He’s the same guy that when the ship went into harbor and made sure the USS McCain was covered, you couldn’t see it. He’s the same guy that denigrated John. He’s the same guy who did a similar thing where he talked about George H.W. Bush, he was shot down in the Pacific. I mean, but he just stands there. It’s almost pathological. I’ve never said anything like that. No ones been better than the military. I just got to focus on what has to be done, not what he did, what I do from here. What gets done from here. Thank you, sir. Thank you, Mr. Vice president, if I could follow up on Ed’s question about voting, we know the president has been attacking mail in voting he’s even now suggesting his supporters vote twice. We also know that Russia has been trying to sow doubt about the system. Yes, I am. That’s why I try not to talk about it too much because I’m playing into. The more we talk about it … There’s two things he wants us to talk about, is the election legitimate? And the whole country is up in flames. Everything’s burning, law and order because he doesn’t want to talk about anything, anything at all about the job he hasn’t done. And so it’s a conundrum. There’s a lot we could talk about in terms of the specifics that Russia is doing and not doing it. But when you do, all it does is undermine what people think may be legitimate. What I don’t want to have happen, I don’t want people reaching the point where you can understand sometimes. It’s not worth voting. It seems to me that one of the things that I keep trying to say to people is, “Go to, Iwillvote.com.” Iwillvote.com and figure out where you can vote, how you can vote. What’s available to you, where you could vote early, where you could vote in person, where it’s going to be safe for you, et cetera. Plan now, plan now. But the more chaos that is sewn here, it’s going to disincline people to show up. And in a sense, every time I speak about it, I feel like I’m playing into his game. Not do you agree with me, but does that make sense what I’m saying? So I think that’s all part of the deal. [inaudible 00:49:29]. Thank you, Mr. Vice President. Going back to the jobless report from this morning, you had acknowledged that less than half of the 22 million jobs that were lost the spring because of the pandemic have been recovered. What do you think the 1. I think any job added back is positive. I think it matters to the people who got that job back. Maybe you all were raised in households like I was where my mom or dad was losing a job because of the economy, what’s going on in your community. You could feel the tension unease in the household, how it just, everything. Worrying about whether you can provide for your family. And then along the way, also look at the people who you’ve got … A couple million people out there close to, who are part time workers who still can’t make it, but are listed as employed. And a lot of them also are in the process of wondering whether or not. I mean, they’re a lot of people lined up in food lines. There are the people, many of them who have lost their healthcare, their health care provided by their employer. They’re the same people out there worrying, if this president is able to win in court and wipe out the entire Affordable Care Act and all the 100 million people with preexisting conditions, won’t be able to get insurance, even if they had the money. It’s just, the anxiety is enormous, is enormous. And look, again, I’m not being solicitous. Among the brightest people I’ve dealt with my whole career, have been the press, not a joke. You’re all extremely well educated. You’re well-read, you have significant backgrounds and the vast majority have tried to report the news, not just opinion, but I can’t believe that you don’t feel the same … Not Democrat, Republican. Okay. You don’t feel the same anxiety because you got a brother, a sister, a mother, a father, son, or a daughter who’s going through what you’re not, what we’re not. We have jobs. I don’t have a job now, but we have jobs. And so it’s a real concern. And I just think that this has moved beyond Democrat, Republican. I think it’s moved to trying to put this country back together again. So we can move. Thank you. Mrs. Garner, one more question on the economy, one more on the economy. Thank you guys, thank you. One more on the economy. Mr. Vice President can I ask [crosstalk 00:52:51]. Pick one from a box for this guy. You like to engage. I like to engage. Mr. Vice President, if I may ask. President Trump has just announced Kosovo and Serbia deal. President Trump has just announced an economic normalization deal between Serbia and Kosovo. And part of that deal is Kosovo and Israel having diplomatic normalization. You have stated that you support a two state solution in the Middle East. Well, first of all, I don’t know what the deal is you’re referring to. Okay. What I have argued relative to Serbia and Kosovo, is that Kosovo should be an independent country, not a part of Serbia. I’ve spent a lot of time there. And so I don’t know how … I assume that would reinforce that independence, but I don’t know, based on what’s being said. I think normalization of relations among countries is a by and large an almost every instance, a good thing to have a Muslim majority country normalizing relations with Israel. And in a generic sense seems positive to me, but I have to know the detail of what’s happening, what’s going on. And I don’t know that and it may, you may be right, that, that would cause the Palestinians to lose leverage in a decision on a two state solution. I’d have to look [crosstalk 00:54:36]. Oh, I do. Absolutely, I do. I do. And I think that’s the thing, recognizing Israel as an independent Jewish state. I think that’s important. But also, I believe that Israel has to be prepared to work toward a genuine two state solution. Thank you all very much. Thank you, Mr. Vice President. [crosstalk 00:54:59], thank you so much. [inaudible 00:55:29]. [inaudible 00:55:29]. Sure. The answer is yes. It’s still a great nation."
"102","09-07-20"," I can’t think of anybody I’d rather have in my corner than you. Folks, Happy Labor Day. Mr. President, it’s great to be with you and with everyone who’s tuning in. Rich and I, as he said, go back a long way. He’s the kind of guy, back in the neighborhood when you’re growing up, you always knew that one person you could turn to, the one guy, woman, who wouldn’t turn their back to you, no matter what. That’s Rich. That’s all of you as well. Throughout my entire career, labors were with me. If there’s one thing this pandemic has done, it’s shown the courage, the character and the deep love of this country that lies at the heart of working people in this nation. Let me tell you something. Folks have figured out, it’s not the financial wizards of Wall Street that made this country run, or make it run. It’s you, America’s essential workers. You’re the folks breaking your necks, risking your lives, keeping the country going, in our hospitals, on our streets, in our schools. I’ve said it time and again, and I’ll say it again and again, Wall Street did not build this country. You did, the great American middle class, and the middle class was built by unions. Unions. The American people now finally get it, after a long time of being convinced that unions were a problem, not the answer. Roughly two-thirds of the American people, roughly two-thirds of them in this country, have a favorable opinion of unions. That matches the highest approval rating Gallup has shown in over 50 years. It’s something I’ve always believed, you’ve always known. My uncle in Scranton, Uncle Ed, used to say, “Joe, you’re labor from belt buckle to shoe sole.” Well, I didn’t have much of a choice, the way I was raised at my grandfather’s table. I’ve never been afraid to say the word “union,” not when I grew up, not today. And you can be sure you’ll be hearing that word “union” plenty of times, if I’m in the White House. The words of a president matter. Union. This pandemic has crushed our country. The sad thing is it didn’t have to be this bad. It’s not this bad in other countries. More than six million COVID cases in the United States, almost 200,000 deaths, projected to go much higher, and nearly 30 million on unemployment. That doesn’t count the seven million who are working part-time, who aren’t counted as unemployed, but still can’t buy the new tires for the car when they’re bald, still can’t take care of the basic things of getting the hot water heater fixed, et cetera; the things we talk about at our kitchen tables. But I have a plan to rebuild this nation. Not only rebuild it, but rebuild it back better. It starts with getting this virus under control. Then we’ll have a transformational investment in roads, bridges, broadband, ports, airports, big projects. We’ll put people to work right away, as well as make sure our country is ready to compete with any country in the future. We’re going to make sure we pay people what they’re worth. It’s not enough to praise our essential workers. It’s about time we start paying you. We’re going to empower workers and empower unions. If I have the honor of becoming your president, I’m going to be the strongest labor president you have ever had. I’m going to make sure we enact the PRO Act, which by the way, Trump had promised when he ran, he would do, and then he threatened to veto if it got passed out of the Senate. That’s right. I’m going to hold company executives personally liable for interfering with workers who are attempting to unionize. It’s not enough just to have their corporations pay a fine. If they’re part of the problem, they are going to pay a personal price. We’re going to have a National Labor Relations Board that actually wears striped shirts, is fair, that actually defends workers’ rights. If you go back to the 1930s, the purpose of the NLRB, what it states, it doesn’t say Americans must merely allow unions to exist. That’s what corporations try to tell you. What the act explicitly says is that the government should encourage unionization. Encourage. The only way to meet, as my dad would say, the abuse of power is with power. The only power is organized worker power, union power, to deal with abuses. That’s exactly what I’ll do as president, I promise you. We’re going to make sure that anytime American government spends American tax dollars, we’re going to spend them in America, with American companies and suppliers, supporting American workers. President Trump keeps talking about how great this economy is, how great the stock market is. I know the reason he didn’t have the guts to take on COVID and threw up the white flag. He was worried if he started talking about saving people’s lives, the stock market may fall. Well, we know it’s been great for his rich friends, but it hasn’t been so great for the rest of us. Millions of people out of work. Evictions on the rise. 20 million people worrying about whether they’re going to lose their home because they have trouble making the mortgage payments. Health care being taken away, and Trump has a plan to gut Social Security. If his Social Security plan he actually puts forward, it actually became law, the Social Security actuary has said the entire Social Security system will be bankrupt by mid 2023. Let’s look at one simple fact. This president is on track to be the only president in modern history to end up with fewer jobs at the end of his term than existed in America when he began his term. But as out of touch as Trump’s language on economy is, when it comes to veterans, he’s downright un-American. I’ve never said that about a president ever, ever, ever, but calling those have served, risked their lives, even gave their lives to our nation, losers and suckers… These are heroes. I’ll tell you something, my Beau wasn’t a loser or a sucker. He spent six months in Kosovo as Assistant US Attorney, trying to make sure that they had a criminal justice system. He’s the only foreigner has a 12-foot statue erected to him, a memorial to him because of what he did in Kosovo. Then he volunteered. He was Attorney General and he had to get special permission to volunteer to go with his unit to Iraq for one solid year. Won the Bronze Star, Conspicuous Service medal, and other awards. He didn’t serve with losers and suckers. He served with heroes. He served with American patriots. None of the veterans you know were losers or suckers. No president has ever talked about our service men and women in that way. Sorry if I’m coming close to losing my temper, but the simple truth is, if that’s how you talk about our veterans, you have no business being President of the United States of America. Period. Trump says he can’t understand why people serve. He’ll never understand. He’ll never understand you, he’ll never understand us, he’ll never understand our cops, our firefighters, because he’s not made of the same stuff that the people who serve this nation are made of. Like so many of you, you live by a code, an American code. Sounds corny, but it’s real. Honor. Duty. Country. Something bigger than yourself. He lives by a code of lies, greed and selfishness. This is Labor Day and we honor all that working folks have done for the people of this country. We honor you, your work, your courage, your commitment to this country. I promise you this. If you give me the honor of being your president, you’ll never have a better friend or a stronger ally in a White House, because if I’m in the oval office, guess who’s going to be there with me? Unions, labor, you. Rich, the bad news for you is there’s no getting away from me pal because I’ll be coming for you. Thank you all and I guess I’m supposed to take questions somewhere along the line here. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Well, thank you Mr. Vice President. Now it is the time for our questions from union members all across the country. We need a president who will look out for every American, not just the wealthy or the ones that have a lot of power in this country. You got to represent every single person. We need an administration that is going to work for everyone across the aisle for the good of the American people. I feel for everybody who lost a family member during COVID because I myself lost somebody, but I think it helped in opening everybody’s eyes and knowing how important it is to elect somebody who’s going to care for you as a working person. They get to appoint people that are on the NLRB board and that really makes a difference on how stuff’s ruled out and how unions can work. In 2016, I did not go vote. I was not involved in politics. I was one of those that said, “They don’t count my votes. My vote, that doesn’t matter. Just turned 18, who really cares?” So this is like a redo for me. It shows that I’m becoming an adult. I have responsibilities. I have a say in what goes on where I live, where I stay, where I put money to, where I put love into. So this election is everything to me. It means that we could change America one vote at a time. My name is Rebecca Vedrine and this is my question. As a black woman in America who’s worked with union jobs and nonunion jobs, I know that there’s 60 million Americans saying that they would vote for a union today. I would like to know what will your administration do to help them give them that chance? Thank you. Moving up here. There used to be a basic bargain in this country. Worker shared in the wealth their work help create. It didn’t go well. They shared in the losses as well, but that bargain’s broken. CEOs are more beholding to shareholders and workers. Instead of boosting wages, they’re increasing stock buy backs and their own pay. 30 years ago, the average CEO fortune 500 companies made 58 times the average worker’s salary. Today, 30 years later, it’s 278 times. What in God’s name happened in the meantime? This pandemic has reminded the nation, we literally couldn’t survive without the health care workers, the first responders, the grocery clerks, the meat packers, the sanitation and transit and postal workers who put their lives on the line for this country and many of them lost their lives. People all across our country have a new appreciation for just how essential you are. They have a new appreciation for how essential unions are as well. Unions are why so many today have health insurance and sick leave. Why so many have a voice in the workplace and our democracy. Unions are why the Cares Act included worker protection and why the Heroes Act, which the Senate hadn’t acted on yet, would require OSHA to boost safety standards. Unions shouldn’t have to go it alone. American workers deserve a partner in the White House, a president who’s on their side. Now Trump talks a big game, but let’s look at the facts. He threatened to veto the PRO Act, continuing to make it harder to organize on the job. He led federal contractors double. He talks about what he’s done now, right, in trade. He led federal contractors double offshoring, offshoring jobs in his first 18 months in office. He gave big tax cuts to corporations without making them bring jobs home. He raised taxes for union members by ending deductions for union dues. List goes on and on. American workers are the very best in the world. We can outcompete anyone. Anyone, period. You deserve a president who fights like the devil for you the way you do for us. That’s what I’ve been trying to do my whole life. As president, I’ll fight to pass the PRO Act and crack down on employers would try to block unions and go further by holding executives accountable for labor law violations, including jail time if they’re prominently involved in breaking the law. Pass the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act to guarantee every sector of worker has the right to bargain. Strengthen and enforce labor standards, including Davis Bacon wages, plus a $15 minimum wage, overtime pay through OSHA, tougher OSHA. By the way, you’re the only guys fighting for people who aren’t even members of the labor union. You’re fighting for workers that aren’t even your members by a $15 minimum wage. Ban right to work laws and stop employers from misclassifying workers as contractors to avoid paying benefits. Give independent contractors and gig workers the right to organize and pass the Bush Lewis Act to protect every worker’s pension and make sure that sacred promise of a secure retirement is honored for everyone. So you don’t wake up one day like my dad did years and years ago, all of a sudden no pension. There’s a lot we can do, but I promise you we can get it done. Thank you Mr. Vice President. Then we look forward to bringing the PRO Act to your desk next year. I want to move on to our next question. Our economy is based on tourism. There’s Disney, there’s Universal Studios, and all the theme parks and all the vacation that people like to do. There are some people going to the parks, but it’s not the same. A lot of people have lost their jobs. A lot of people are hurting. We went from being able to provide for our families, being able to take care of our households to basically going to assistant programs for food and for utility help and trying to make it from unemployment. I mean, it’s been a drastic depression to my industry. The last six months, we have been calling on the Trump administration to invoke the Defense Production Act of 1950 to mass produce PPE or personal protective equipment, ventilators, and other needed supplies and it hasn’t happened. I get reminded every day that bus operators, train operators, transit workers are still in the front lines of this pandemic. They’re the first contact is what the sick people are not feeling well. They’re not driving to the hospital. A lot of them were taking the bus or the train. So we’re the first ones exposed to this. That’s why a lot of the transit workers were dying from it and still are to this day. Just like any small community in the Midwest, it’s hitting people hard, jobs. People are struggling to pay rent. People are struggling to put food on the table for their families. The good thing about a Midwest town is we all rally together. Hi, my name is Danny Groves. To me, Amtrak employees are family man, family. No one I think has ridden more on Amtrak than a conductor or engineer than me. I’ve made over two million miles on Amtrak they tell me. 36 years, every single day and then a lot when I was vice president. Every single day and then a lot when I was vice president and your family. I want to thank Amtrak, Amtrak workers and engineers but that’s a different question. Here’s the deal. You all have said it, America has been knocked down by this pandemic. Over 190,000 Americans are dead. 6.2 million are infected with COVID. 30 million unemployed and nearly one in six small businesses have been shut down. Worst of all it didn’t have to be this way. No other country in the world let COVID spiral so far out of control. Donald Trump ignored the warnings, refused to prepare, and failed to protect our nation and now, more than six months in, he still doesn’t have a plan. No plan. What’ll he do? Nothing [inaudible 00:18:51] the same. What I’ll do? As president on day one, I’ll implement the national strategy I’ve laid out since March to beat this virus. Only then will we really get our economy moving and our kids safely back in school and our lives back on track. That means calling on every American, every American, to wear a mask outside of their house [inaudible 00:19:15] outside of their household. Surging free testing and contract tracing to stop COVID spread. Charting a clear path of science-based vaccines. Free from politics. I get asked the question, “If the president announced tomorrow we had a vaccine, would you take it?” Only if it was completely transparent, that other experts in the country could look at it. Only if we knew all of what went into it, because so far nothing he’s told us has been true and it means fighting like hell to keep workers safe on the job and getting real relief out to families and small businesses, not the Mar-a-Lago crowd that Trump bumped to the head of the line with the act that was passed with all that money. A significant portion of that went to big business, it didn’t go to small businesses. Look the bottom line is the Republican Senate has to pass the second piece of legislation Nancy and the Democrats passed in the House, the HEROES Act. They need to pass it today, and then as president, I’ll keep workers safe, use the full Defense Production Act to get every worker, job site, school in our country the PPE and testing they need. I was one of the first ones to argue he invoke the act. He took so long and he only did it partially. Require OSHA to boost safety standards, rehiring the investigators that Trump let go, protecting whistleblowers, extending OSHA coverage to all, and I say all, public employees. Provide paid sick and emergency leave for everyone, whether you work in a big company or a small non-profit. Keep families whole. Expand PPP. Require companies that get bailouts like airlines to keep workers on the payroll or they don’t get the bailout. No more no strings attached money. Extend unemployment insurance for as long as this crisis lasts. Boost rent relief. Suspending evictions isn’t enough. You have to keep families and landlords from wracking up bankrupting debts. What happens in six months when all of a sudden, the six months or seven months of rent comes due? Or what happens to that landlord, particularly the small ones, who aren’t going to be able to keep the place open? Cancel $10,000.00 in student debt per person while this COVID is going on. They can’t afford to pay it back. There’s so much more, but the bottom-line is focus on getting this economy and average families back up and in the game. They money is there. Pass the act, and by the way, when I ran the act, the Recovery Act when we inherited the greatest recession short of a depression up to that time? The president put me in charge, I had 18 months to distribute over $ 800 billion to keep us from going into depression. All the studies including the conservative outfits pointed out less than two-tenths of 1% waste or fraud, and we put over $140 billion back to the states. States have to balance their budgets. The reason the federal government doesn’t have to is to deal with crises like this. What happened? We kept tens of thousands of schoolteachers, firefighters, law enforcement officers, sanitary workers, the essential workers on a job already were in real trouble, the layoffs that are occurring. He has no sense of it and he must agree with Mitch McConnell who says, “Let the states go bankrupt.” Okay Mitch, let’s see what happens if that happens. Anyway, I could go on, I apologize but there’s so much we can do. Thank you. Thank you Mr. Vice President and I promise you, the labor movement will not rest until the HEROES Act is the law of the land. I promise that to you. Let’s move to our final question. Mr. Vice President, the COVID-19 pandemic and the nation’s response to it has highlighted the already existing but often too ignored systematic inequalities with America’s education system. This organization isn’t going to make four more years if Trump gets another term. When COVID first hit, there was the thought that the Postal Service had lost so much mail volume that we may run out of money [inaudible 00:24:13] back in March and April when you were talking about the Postal Service running out of money some time between June and maybe September. That was very worrying because if the Postal Service runs out of money, we had no idea if we were going to get paid, if our benefits were still going to be up, or whether we were going to be forced to come to work. I have a 21-year-old son and personally the election is about his future. My name is Ketha Otis and I would like to know what would you do to protect our public schools, our public services, and public service workers? Thank you. Ketha, thank you. Thank all of you. First I want to thank every public employee watching for your courage. I mean that sincerely. The past three months, you’ve fought the daily pandemic without enough supplies or support from your government. The whole country owes you. We have to do a lot more than just praise you. We have to make sure you can stay working and protect it and we have to pay you fairly. This pandemic has slammed states and cities with rising costs, shrinking tax revenues, and Trump passed the buck, turned his back, and stuck states with the bill. You notice he says it’s not my responsibility. What in the hell is his job if it’s not his responsibility? So I say it again, the Republican Senate has to do its job. Pass the HEROES Act now, so painful cuts don’t have to [inaudible 00:25:54] today’s crisis and make it even worse. Already, there are 1,100,000 state and local employees have lost their job. 1,100,000 because the states don’t have the money to keep them on a payroll. 50% more than did in the whole Great Recession and economists say there’s worse to come. It’s past time we get state and local governments the funding they need, to keep millions of teachers and cops and firefighters, mail carriers, bus drivers, sanitation workers and more on the job. By the way, bus drivers, they’re the folks who are catching COVID. People getting on the bus without the kind of protection that is needed. People getting on the bus where bus drivers have no option. I could go on but I won’t. It just makes me angry. As I said when I ran the Recovery Act, we made sure we got $144 billion to state and local governments, and it’s long past time to get the Post Office the $25 billion in emergency funds it needs to keep running. … Want to do that. He wants to make sure those mail-in ballots don’t get where they’re supposed to get. He’s trying to knee cap a core American service. First postmaster general, Benjamin Franklin. Stop playing politics, Mr. President, with the 330,000 veterans who get their prescriptions by mail, by mail, and they’re getting late. Mail is a lifeline for small businesses and rural communities, this whole country, especially now through this pandemic. 600,000 brave postal workers deserve our full support. Bottom line, this isn’t some math exercise. This isn’t about you, Mr. President. This is about the American people I’m talking to now. It’s about the people that are doing the job. It’s about all of you listening, your jobs, your communities. Now more than ever, you deserve better. We should all be taking this fight to Trump and to McConnell. Make them stop playing political games with the heroes who really are keeping this nation going. And then as president, I’ll guarantee all workers, all workers have a right to collectively bargain. So even those who’ve seen the rights stripped away in states like Wisconsin and Iowa once again can negotiate for better wages and working conditions and have a stronger voice on the job. People are dying, out of work, afraid for their children. The clock is ticking. We have to give workers the power to make their families whole and make them whole now. People are getting killed figuratively and literally across the board. Folks, look, in spite of all of this, I’ve never, Rich, been more optimistic than I am today. It’s the confluence of the COVID crisis, a phenomenally negative impact on the economy and the systemic racism have added up and taking the blinders off of millions and millions of Americans saying, Oh my God, I didn’t realize the reason I could stay home safely is because of that person breaking their neck, risking their lives and some losing their lives. I didn’t realize that there are people in operating rooms and nurses that in the very beginning had to put on plastic garbage bags because they couldn’t find protective gear they needed. I didn’t realize. I now realize and know what you all have done for the country and they’re ready to step up. We don’t have to punish anybody, just make sure everybody pays their fair share and everybody gets their fair shot. I can end with when my dad, Richard’s heard me say this a hundred times, when my dad had to move from Scranton when there was no work down to Wilmington, Delaware and finally we moved in with my grandpa, like a lot of people had to. I’m not unique in this regard. My brothers and sisters aren’t either. I remember him coming up the stairs saying, honey, we can’t live in this apartment anymore. We’re going to, and you can’t go to school. You can’t play on that little league team. You’re going to go home and live with grandpa. And it must’ve been hard for my dad to walk into my grandpop’s pantry, a man with four sons and lost one in World War II and a daughter and saying, Ambrose, can I leave the kids with you? It’s only going to be, take me about a year, but I’ll come home every weekend. It’s only 157 miles. A lot of people have made that longest walk up a short flight of stairs to tell their kids that they can’t stay in the same school, can’t play in the same club. They’re going to have to move. When my dad moved, he got a job cleaning boilers in Wilmington, and we moved into an apartment complex. And we finally, after five years, four years able to buy a small home, which is we’re happy. Nice middle class home, three bedroom home, four kids and a grandpop. And we were happy. I sometimes look back and wonder how my parents did it with those very thin walls. But my point is this, we did fine. My dad used to always use the following phrase and I’ll end with this, I promise. He said, Joe, remember, he told and my siblings, Joey, remember, a job’s about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in the community. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, honey, it’s going to be okay and mean it. And mean it. It’s about your dignity. You deserve. You deserve to be afforded the dignity every human being does. And the surest way to maintain that dignity and acquire it is through the union movement. And I’m with you. I promise you. Thank you for listening. Thank you very much, Mr. Vice President, for those words, wonderful words. And I promise you, we’ll never stop fighting for that dignity with you and we’ll never stop fighting for our teachers and our public service workers and all the heroes who make our country go every day. They are essential as you noted, not expendable. And I want to thank you for noting that and for fighting for them and spending your entire life trying to help workers get a better life and achieve that dignity that your dad talked about. Mr. One last thing, we better take care of the teachers. My wife taught for the last 30 some years. She taught full time, 15 credits when she was Second Lady and next semester she hopes at least to teach one course, at least online. And we’re already short about 125,000 teachers. And if we don’t do something about it, it’ll be close to a quarter million teachers by 2023. And that can’t happen. Because if it does, I’ll be sleeping alone. I’ll be on my own. I’ll need help. All kidding aside, there’s so much we can do, and I can’t do it without you, Rich. And I really appreciate your friendship. Thank you, everybody. Happy Labor Day. It’s going to get better. Mr. Vice President, godspeed and good luck. We want to thank you so much for caring and not just caring about workers, but making a lifetime endeavor out of fighting for those same workers. You’ve been a friend to workers your entire career. And from the bottom of my heart, I want to say thank you for that. And for all of you out there that joined us, I want to thank you for joining us today. And I want you to have a very, very happy Labor Day. And then please, please go out and vote. Our country depends on it. God bless. Thank you. Thanks, Rich."
"103","09-09-20"," It’s great to be here in Michigan and with the United auto workers. As they say, in parts of my state, I got brung up on General Motors. My father ran a General Motors agency. He didn’t own it, but he ran it and cars or cars or cars. By the way, I still have my ’67 Corvette that’s new. It was new. I still keep that, but I got to tell you, I’m waiting for that electric one you just made that goes 210 miles an hour, but that’s a different story. Look, earlier this week and the reason we’re a little bit late here, we found as I was getting off the plane, the press asked me a legitimate question that I did not have the background on because it occurred on the plane. Earlier this week, we celebrated Labor Day. And here in the heart of the American automobile industry, we never forget everything that we owe the unions. And unions, as you’ve heard me say many times, built this country. Unions built the economy. The economic engine has driven American manufacturing dynamism. And literally in the case of the auto workers, you’re the ones that did it. So I want to thank you again, UAW region one, for hosting me today. And it’s great to see Senator Stabenow. My good friend, Debbie Stabenow. Got a chance to spend a little time with the governor, but Senator Stabenow and I worked together on an awful lot of matters over the years in the United States Senate. She was a great partner to me when I was vice president and we worked in lockstep to get the people in Michigan back on their feet. We’re joined by one of the best and brightest and hardest working governors around, my friend, Gretchen Whitmer. And if you’re wondering what responsible strong executive leadership looks like in COVID-19, just look at this executive right here. Governor, you’ve done an incredible job steering the people of Michigan through a turbulent time. Much of it is brought on by Donald Trump’s lack of leadership. You’ve been rock solid, governor. You’ve listened to the experts and you’ve led with science and you put the needs of the people, who are hurting first, helping them get through this crisis. Meanwhile, on the day that we hit 190,000 dead in the United States, because of COVID-19, we just learned from the Washington Post columnist Bob Woodward that the president of the United States has admitted on tape in February he knew about COVID-19 that had passed through the air. He knew how deadly it was. It was much more deadly than the flu. He knew and purposely played it down. Worse, he lied to the American people. He knowingly and willingly lied about the threaded pose to the country for months. He had the information. He knew how dangerous it was. Now, while this deadly disease ripped through our nation, he failed to do his job on purpose. It was a life and death betrayal of the American people. Experts say that if he had acted just one week sooner, 36,000 people would have been saved. If he acted two weeks sooner, back in March, 54,000 lives would have been spared in March and April alone. His failure has not only costs lives. He sent our economy in a tailspin. It costs millions more in American livelihoods. This is a recession created by Donald Trump’s negligence. And he is unfit for this job as a consequence of it. How many parents feel abandoned and overwhelmed? How many frontline workers are exhausted and pushed to the limits? And how many families are missing loved ones at their dinner table tonight because of his failures? It’s beyond despicable. It’s a dereliction of duty. It’s a disgrace. We’re going to hear a lot more about this. I’m sure, not just from me, but from the news media and a lot of others, but I want to ask you one simple question. In 2016, then candidate Trump came here to Warren just a few days before the election. Here’s what he said. He said, “If I’m elected, you won’t lose one plant. You have plants coming into this country. You’re going to have jobs again. You won’t lose one plant. I promise you. I promise you.” That’s what he said. Donald Trump makes a lot of promises. He promised that he alone could stop the off shoring of jobs. He promised he bring back jobs, stop companies from leaving. He could do what, “Nobody else could do it, but him.” Nut he promised it has administration would enforce every last buying American provision on behalf of the American people. And what makes his wild claims and hopes, he now hopes we don’t notice what he said or won’t remember. And when he does follow through or doesn’t do with follow through the exact opposite, he’s hoping we just have poor memories. He doesn’t give us much credit, but the American people are smart, honest, decent, and they’re hard working. And we expect our president to be straight with us, to do what he or she says they’re going to do. So let’s look at the reality of Donald Trump’s economy and what exactly his promise to the American people and workers are worth. He’s on track to be the first president since Herbert Hoover in the Great Depression to see the number of jobs in our economy go down, not up while being president. Our economy’s down 4.7 million jobs since he took office, 4.7. Even before President Trump’s failed response to COVID-19 crashed through our economy, his reckless and chaotic trade policy had thrown American manufacturing into recession. It was already contracting in 2019, even when COVID-19 hit, before it hit. Trump was creating an average of 500,000 jobs fewer per year than the last three years when President Obama and I were an office. When the GM transmission plant here in Warren close last year, I bet the workers around weren’t all that comforted by Trump’s empty promises. Under Donald Trump, Michigan lost auto jobs, even before COVID did. And what about off shoring? Has Trump delivered on stopping companies from shipping jobs overseas, American jobs? You already know the answer. Of course not. The rate of offshoring by federal contractors, there are people that get federal dollars from the federal government to do things. The off shoring, big companies being paid by US Taxpayers has doubled, doubled under Trump. Those federal contracts with your tax dollars. They’ve doubled the number that had been off shored. He invited companies to the White House to make what he called the pledge to American workers. He couldn’t even keep those firms from outsourcing. Many were given lucrative federal contracts, but then some of them turned around and shipped 7,000 jobs overseas. Under President Trump, US trade deficit has grown. It’s hit an all time high. Let me say that again. US trade deficit is at an all time high under Trump in the last three years. President Trump’s answered all this as the same as he’s answered everything. Corporate tax giveaways that actually ward off shoring. You heard me right. Giveaways that reward offshoring. If you offshore, you get more tax breaks. His 2017 tax bill slashed taxes on companies that sent production and jobs overseas. Those corporations then make huge profits by shipping these foreign made products back to the United States to sell to American consumers. And no industry has taken a greater advantage of Trump’s offshoring tax loopholes than the pharmaceutical industry. Big pharma lobbied Trump for a handout. That’s exactly what they got from him. US pharma is building factories overseas instead of the United States, skipping out on having to pay US taxes and then sending those same foreign made drugs back to American consumers, all while raising their prices on prescription drugs that union families and working people have to rely on. And in the process by the way, he’s trying to do away with all healthcare in America. During a pandemic, we’re seeing not only the inequity of this policy, but the enormous vulnerability that this creates for our own health security. And our security requires us to have supply chains of the necessary drugs based here, not overseas. Not overseas in times of crisis. And what about Trump’s commitment to buy American? Like the rest of President Trump’s promise it has nothing to do with reality. It’s all a bunch of hot air. In fact, contracts awarded by US governments to foreign companies using American tax dollars went up 30% since he’s been president. So to recap, one, Trump hasn’t stopped companies from closing plants and sending jobs overseas. Two, he’s rewarded companies that have cut jobs and failed to invest here at home with billions of dollars in tax breaks. And three, he’s awarding more and more federal contracts to foreign companies. President Trump has broken just about every promise he’s ever made to the American worker. And he’s failed. He’s failed our economy and our country. But look, would you really expect anything different from this guy? From someone who called those of you and those who are serving in uniform, who have given their lives to the country losers and suckers? Let me tell you something. My son Beau is an assistant US attorney. He volunteered to go to Kosovo to help them set up a government in the middle of the war. I know I’m being proud here, but he’s the only foreigner has a monument that they raised and built in service to him, thanking him for what he did. My son also then as attorney general volunteered to go to Iraq for one year. He wasn’t a loser or a sucker. No one who served this nation has been a loser or a sucker. They’re all heroes. Or would you expect anything different than someone who could stand next to a father of a fallen soldier and say at a cemetery and say, “I don’t get it. Donald Trump does understand what it means to serve something bigger than yourself. He doesn’t understand duty, honor, country. He lives by a different code. Lies, selfishness, greed. Yes, Donald Trump and I have a pretty different philosophy when it comes to giving our word. Mine means something. When I tell the American people I’m going to do something, I follow through. Here in Michigan, you know that’s true. When Barack and I took office back in 2009, the economy was crashing. We inherited an economy in free fall. And millions of Americans, including so many right here in Michigan, lost their jobs, their homes, and their savings. With the help of Debbie breaking her neck here, President Obama and I worked hard. He put me in charge of the Recovery Act. I spent a lot of time here in Michigan and Detroit, working with you and Senator Stabenow, and thinking every single day about the folks on the factory line, busting their necks, just trying to put food on the table. A lot of folks were all ready to count Detroit out as well as the auto American industry to count it out. But I knew what Debbie knew. I’ve known always. It’s never a good bet to bet against the American worker. So when we promise to stand with the American auto industry, we delivered. We didn’t do it to help wealthy investors or pad bonus checks for CEOs, we did it to save an iconic American industry, a testament to the skills and ingenuity of American manufacturing. And the jobs of hundreds of thousands of American workers and the lifeblood of communities all across the Midwest, and used to be in my state of Delaware as well. When Detroit declared bankruptcy, I was right here working alongside the city leaders to get the lights turned back on to revitalize the future of Detroit. Well, nearly 20,000 auto manufacturing jobs have been lost in Michigan under Trump. Nearly 80,000 were created during the Obama Biden administration. I’ve got long history. I’m not just talking about what I’m going to do, but delivering results for Michiganders. And now, we need to do it again. We need to do the hard work, not only to recover, but to build the economy back for the future once more. That’s why my build back better agenda, that’s what it’s all about. Starts right here with you in the union halls, all across America. Back in July, I made the first plank in my agenda a plan to modernize American manufacturing and technology to ensure that the future is made in America, by all of you. And today, I’m announcing some additional steps to make this plank even stronger. First, we’re going to impose a tax penalty on companies that avoid paying US taxes by off shoring jobs and manufacturing, only to sell those goods back to the American consumer. If your big corporate strategy is to boost your shareholders profits, your CEOs’ bonuses by moving jobs out, well, we’re going to make sure you not only pay full US taxes on those profits, but we’re going to guarantee. We’re going to add a 10% off shoring penalty surge tax to your bill. No more deductions for writing off expenses for the cost of sending jobs overseas, which is a big deal that could be done here at home by qualified American workers. I’m not looking to punish American business, but there’s a better way. Make it in Michigan, make it in America, invest in our communities and the workers in places like Warren. That’s what this is about. UAW workers, steel workers, IBW workers. You’re the best craftsmen and women in the world. And you’re right here. If you’re ready to make it in America, then just like there are consequences for off showing, there will be rewards and incentives for creating good paying jobs here at home. Today, I’m announcing my new Made in America tax credit, a 10% advanceable tax credit for companies that invest in the United States and American workers, to help accelerate the recovery under our build back better agenda. So if your company revitalizes a closing facility here in the United States, like the transmission plant that got closed last year, we’ll take care of 10% of the investment that company makes to reopen it. If you retool a manufacturing facility to make it more competitive, for example, by shifting to help build a new fleet of clean American vehicles made by UAW members, we’ll make sure that’s more than affordable for you. We’re going to make sure you’ll get a tax credit. If you reshore jobs that have previously been sent overseas, expand your operations in the United States or increase wages for manufacturing jobs will make an even smarter strategic decision for your company because we will make sure you get a tax credit. These two steps on top of my plans to close each and every one of the Trump loopholes that he created in 2017 with his tax cut to reward companies with big tax breaks for off shoring. That’s going to end. If you’re going to want to build things here in the United States, because under our administration, the Biden Harris Administration, is going to deliver on the promise to buy American. It’s been a law for almost a century, but we’ve never lived up to it. The idea is simple. Today, the US government spends about $600 billion of taxpayer’s money on federal contracts annually. And that money should go to support American jobs and American businesses. But President Trump has only ever treated it like it was a weak suggestion. Agencies of the federal government can waive the requirements, explanations that Trump doesn’t bother even kick back on. We’re going to change that when I’m president. In my first week, I’ll sign a series of executive actions to make sure we enforce by America and direct the full purchasing power of the federal government to fulfill his promise, starting by closing those waiver loopholes immediately. And I promise you, I’ll use the full power of the Defense Production Act to enforce buy American and tighten the rules for public infrastructure projects, roads, bridges, canals, airports. And I’m going to crack down on companies that label products as made in America, even if they’re coming from China or elsewhere. We found out that on Trump’s watch a company selling deployment bags to active duty troops being deployed falsely claimed this product was made in America. When in fact, it was really made mostly in China. Trump didn’t do anything to respond. I’m not going to let that happen on my watch. We’re going to have an office at the White House dedicated to making sure everyone is playing by the same made in America rules. And one more thing, when I say we’re going to use the purchasing power of the federal government to reinvigorate domestic manufacturing, I mean. We’re going to do that with the American automobile industry as well. United States government owns and maintains an enormous fleet of vehicles. We’re going to convert those government vehicles into electric vehicles, made in America, sourced right here in the United States of America. With the government providing the demand and support to retool factories that are suggesting they’re struggling to compete, the United States automobile industry will set up expanding the capacity in the United States, not China, to lead the world in clean energy vehicles. I can’t wait to get, I said, behind that all electric Corvette that goes 210 miles an hour. Y’all think I’m kidding. I mean it. Last year, that converted Corvette set a speed record of 210.2 miles per hour, electric vehicle. So don’t tell me we don’t still make the best cars right here in the United States of America, and trucks. We’re going to make it easy for American consumers to switch to electric vehicles. We’re going to build on all the new infrastructure we’re going to build on highways. We’re going to build a network of 500,000 charging stations across America, providing prevailing wage jobs for the IBW and other craftsmen all across the country. And by offering rebates and incentives to swap older fuel efficient vehicles for new clean American made models, saving hundreds of millions of barrels of oil. And together, this will mean, listen to me now, 1 million new jobs in the American automobile industry, 1 million. With supply chain, as well as the associated infrastructure, we can do this. We can do this. We can revitalize our industrial base as the heart of the American middle class. Think about the worker in Warren who when the transmission plant closed, he told a reporter and I’m quoting him, “Getting a good GM job 23 years ago for me was like winning the lottery,” he said. “I was trying to start a family. I was able to buy a house. I went to Disney world, all that.” Think about that. A job that felt like winning a lottery because it opened the door to a life that you wanted for yourself, because it gave you dignity, allowed you to provide for your family. Getting a good job in 2020, right here in America, shouldn’t be a lottery. It should be an absolute expectation for everyone. I don’t accept the defeatist view that the forces of automation and globalization mean we can’t keep good paying union jobs here in America and create more of them. I don’t buy for one second that the vitality of American manufacturing is a thing of the past. We have the most qualified workers in the world. American manufacturing, is the old expression you heard your grandpop say or your grandmother, was the arsenal of democracy in World War II. Well, guess what? It’s going to be part of the engine of American prosperity now in 2021, and we’re going to make it happen with American grit, American determination, and American union workers. Look, folks. That’s my promise to you. And keep in mind, back in the 30s, they set up the law relating to unions. It said that not you could have a union, it said the government should encourage unions to increase [inaudible 00:25:10]. You’re going to have the best, most friendly union president in history of the United States of America, when I’m in the White House. I want to thank you all, for all you do. Don’t give up hope. Don’t give up hope. We can come back. We can come back stronger than we were before. I want to thank you all. I carry with me… I don’t have it. I gave it to my staff. I carry with me in my pocket… Do I have that around, anyone? Where’s my staff? I gave it away. Anyway, I carry a schedule in my pocket that lists every single day the number of troops lost in Afghanistan and Iraq. The number wounded. This is my schedule. The back of the schedule is always a black box. You can’t really see it. The press may be able to. It says daily US updates. Troops died in Iraq and Afghanistan, 6,922, not over 6,000, 6,922, is every one of those women and men left behind. An entire group of people relied on them. US troops wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan, 53,188. Not over 53,000. US COVID infected in America, 6,344,700. US COVID deaths, 189,506. Military COVID infected, 118,984. Military COVID deaths, 6,114. Folks, every one of these lives matter. Every one of these lives left somebody behind grieving. We can’t ever forget them, ever, ever forget them. Thank you all. God bless you. And may God protect our troops. Thank you."
"104","09-15-20"," Thank you Serg. Thank you, to [Sean 00:00:09]. I thank you for you as a service and thank you for your continued commitment to supporting our students and veterans as they pursue their educations. Thank you a Hillsborough Community College for hosting us today. My wife Jill is a community college professor and I’ve known for a long, long time that community colleges, she says, are the best kept secret in America, in terms of our education system. This is just one reason why. You help people take the next step in their lives to get the training and accreditation that they need, including our vets, who after years of dedication to our country are ready to build civilian lives of meaning and of opportunity. Less than 1% of the population of our country chooses to serve our country in the military. Less than 1% risk everything to defend our nation, our values and everything we hold dear and the other 99% of us, we owe them. We owe them our thanks, our gratitude and our respect. In my view, based on reports of interviews, President Trump has proven he’s unfit to hold the office of the president time again, but nowhere are his faults more glaring and more offensive, to me at least, than when it comes to his denigration of our service members, veterans, wounded warriors, the fallen. Quite frankly, I won’t say I get angry. Quite frankly, it makes me a very upset the way he gets in front of a camera and crows about how much he has done for veterans and then turns around and salts our service members and fallen heroes when the camera’s off. He calls the suckers and losers. My son Beau was a US attorney, he volunteered to go six months to Kosovo to help them set up a criminal justice system. He did such a good job there, the Kosovo government named a highway after him, and erected a war memorial. Then he had to get an exemption because he was attorney general in the state of Delaware, to go with his unit to Iraq, and he went for a year, in Iraq, came home with a Bronze Star. He’s gone now, but he was no sucker. He was a man, like many of the people he served with. Women and men who served with him served in a way that they should be honored as heroes, not in some derogatory way. They didn’t come home losers. They came home heroes. I think it’s an absolute disgrace. Donald Trump has no idea about the ideas that animate women and men who sign up to serve, duty, honor, country. That’s what service and patriotism is all about: Duty, honor, country. As reported from a very reliable source, and confirmed by many major outlets, that he said to a fallen father, a member of the service, the father of a fallen soldier, who was himself was a member of the service, as he was standing by the grave site, he allegedly said, “I don’t get it. What was in it for them?” What was in it for them? Donald Trump doesn’t seem to be able to conceive the idea of selfless service or being part of a cause that’s bigger than yourself. Every day I carry with me a card and I’ve been doing this for better part of 14 years. It’s my schedule. On the back of it, wherever the schedule ends, there’s always a black box that I have here. It says, “Daily troop updates.” Us troops died in Iran and Afghanistan, 6,000 as of today, 923, not roughly 6,900, 923, because every one of these fallen angels left behind a family, and left behind a community. There’s an empty seat that table now. US troops wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan, 53, 192, not over 53,000. I’ve flown back on those C-130s with caskets draped coming out of Iraq and Afghanistan. I’ve been there at Dover Air Base when those bodies come home. I think of all the folks, and you all know it, coming home with unseen injuries. Tens of thousands coming home with unseen injuries, post traumatic stress, traumatic brain injury, mental health challenges. As a nation, I’ve been criticized for this over the last 30 years when I’ve said it. But as a nation, we have many obligations to our children, to the elderly, to the poor, to those in need. But I believe we only have one truly sacred obligation, to prepare and equip our troops that we send in a harm’s way and to care for them and their families when they return. We owe our veterans the future of security and dignity that they’ve earned and it starts by protecting the VA. Restoring the trust in the VA because the VA must be the premier provider of healthcare services to promote our veterans overall wellbeing. That’s why the VA has more specialized knowledge about how to treat veterans unique health needs beyond physical and mental than the private sector does by far. It provides a community of understanding and support, facilitates accountability for veterans health and wellbeing as a whole. That is absolutely vital for successful outcomes. We have a responsibility to ensure that we’re providing the veterans with world-class healthcare they deserve in every situation. That means hiring more doctors and medical personnel and professionals to work at the VA, including positions essential to veterans health care, nurses and psychologists. We need to offer these medical professionals the incentive to join the VA. We need to pay them and competitive salary to the private sector. We also have to do more to build a pipeline of doctors and nurses, especially in rural areas. If you live far away from a VA center, it’s absolutely essential that you can see a doctor closer to home. That’s why during our administration, President Obama signed the VA Access, Choice and Accountability Act into law in 2014. President Trump likes to say he passed the VA Choice, but just like everything else he seems to be saying, it’s a figment of his imagination or it’s a flat lie. Now I need to keep working to implement the MISSION Act effectively and efficiently so that works for all our veterans while always making sure community care providers are held to the same high quality standard as VA centers. We’re going to make sure our women veterans and our LGBTQ veterans get the service and respect they deserve from culturally competent providers, and critically, we’re going to make sure that no veteran is locked out of treatment for conditions related to toxic exposure from burn pits or traumatic brain injuries they experienced in the line of duty. We made that mistake With Agent Orange. As a Senator, I fought for decades to help Vietnam veterans get access and help, we were able to expand on it during the Obama- Biden administration. We can’t let this be delayed again, denying access because the Fed could not prove a direct connection. If you’re exposed to Agent Orange, it was wrong, and it’s to be presumed. If the ailment you have is caused by your exposure to Agent Orange that you get treatment. We’ve got to seriously tackle the mental health crisis we have. A suicide epidemic is claiming far too many of our veterans and service members. One of the saddest things that my son came home … After a year in Iraq, he was back as attorney general. The week before Christmas, he came over to the house. He said, “Dad I don’t know what I’m going to do. There was a Marine veteran who had been deployed a total of six times, if my memory is correct, who was in a relatively a modern upscale neighborhood, middle class neighborhood, and he got up in the morning and he got out, and I think it was a Dodge Ram started down the street in front of his house, which was no sidewalks. Saw a woman walking her dog, ran over her, killed her, killed the dog, put her in the back of his pickup truck, took her down to I95, right by where there was all the sand pile for emergencies, molested her, put her back in the truck, came home and called the state police and said, “I just killed someone. There was a voice in my head saying, “I had to kill someone.” I had to kill someone,” and turn himself in. You know, the latest data suggests that almost 600 veterans as well are dying by suicide every year, just here in Florida, 600 a year. It’s devastating. There aren’t any easy answers to this, but we can do so much better than we’re doing now. We have an obligation to do so much better. We have to help our heroes understand that it’s an honorable thing to do and take strength to reach out and ask for help if they’re suffering from unseen wounds. They’re so accustomed to being asked not to ask for anything. We have to end the stigma surrounding mental health treatment. When they do reach out, when they call the crisis hotline or walk into a VA hospital or visit a VA center for counseling, we have to make sure, damn sure, that no one turns them away. No one tells them they have to wait. Part of it’s also making sure that veterans feel a sense of security and connection and mission in the civilian world, as they did on active duty, better employment opportunities, meaningful career trajectories, education, like the one student vets get here at Hillsborough Community College, which translate into greater opportunities for our vets, not just putting money on the pockets of, for profit fraudulent outfits, because we got to stop that. It all matters. It especially matters how their families are treated. John Milton, the poet, wrote these lines, “They also serve who only stand and wait.” Well, military families, husbands, wives, sons, daughters, mothers, fathers, they serve every single day tending to their specific needs and unique challenges, and should never be an afterthought for us. It’s a national security imperative. Fulfilling our promise to our veterans, and our military families, caregivers and survivors is critical to ensuring that we not only meet our obligations, but the future generations continue to volunteer to serve. My wife, Jill, she worked on this more than about anyone. During our administration, she and Michelle Obama teamed up and started an outfit called Joining Forces, a nationwide initiative to drive concrete commitments to support service members, veterans, and their families and caregivers and survivors, to help make sure teachers are equipped to better meet the needs of military children in their classrooms, and help bring down some of the barriers because the vast majority, the vast majority of those kids in the school have no idea that little Johnny or Mary or Jamal is worried because his mommy or daddy is stationed in a foreign land. It makes it so much harder for military spouses to find good jobs and build their careers. I have to change it and we’re working on that, working with leaders like Lauren Weiner, Hiring Our Heroes and Military Spouses Employment program. For example, making it easy to carry your professional credentials with you from one state to another when your spouse moves. Harris-Biden administration is going to relaunch that effort and keep pushing further to make it easier for military spouses and veterans to find meaningful careers, to ensure teachers know how to support military children in their classrooms, and to improve support for caregivers and survivors so much more than we do now. This isn’t a theoretical commitment, it’s personal. The year that my son Beau deployed to Iraq, with his National Guard unit, that’s when Jill and I learned what it really means to be part of a military family. You end up praying every night and every morning for the safety of your child, far from home, in the middle of a war zone, facing unknown dangers. Every family gathering, they’re missed. Every time the children ask why mommy or daddy isn’t there to tuck them in, it hurts. These are the challenges most Americans never have to face. These are the women and men and they’re families. They’re the absolute best that our country has to offer. They’re the backbone of America. Some of the most meaningful moments of my vice presidency, of those eight years, was Thanksgiving. We’d host a Thanksgiving meal for the wounded veterans at the vice presidential residence. We’d spend every Christmas day visiting the patients at Walter Reed hospital. I spent time with our wounded warriors in trauma centers all across the country and around the world. You know what the message often heard when I’d walk in and say, “Soldier, sailor, Marine, what can I do for you?” Whether they’re amputees or not, their arms not there, they try to pull themselves up and try to salute, and they’d say, “Yes, sir. I want to go back to my unit. Does that sound like the heart and the grit and patriotism of a sucker or a loser? It sounds like heroism to me. It sounds like what patriotism is all about. Our military is the greatest fighting force in the history of the world and that’s not hyperbole. It’s the God’s truth. It deserves a commander in chief who respects their sacrifice, understands their service and will never betray the values they defend. They deserve better than goes on now with their commander in chief. If I have the honor of ever serving as the next commander in chief, I want every single member of the Armed Forces, our veterans, their families, their caregivers, and their survivors to know, I will never treat you with anything other than the honor and respect and dignity you deserve. I’ll always have your back, like you’ve had our back, the country’s back. Thank you all. May God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you Vice President Biden for your compelling remarks. Thank you to Hillsborough Community College for hosting this event, and thank you to the viewers around the country who are watching today. I have the great honor of being not only a participant, but a moderator for today’s events. My name is Lauren Weiner, and I’m the CEO of WWC Global. In 2004. My husband received military orders to Naples, Italy. As I prepared for our adventure, I soon realized that moving would bring a myriad of unexpected career challenges. In particular, there was a formal policy on base that prohibited local military spouses for applying for professional level jobs. I had come from the White House and realized quickly that my career was at a total standstill. Fast forward 16 years, and not only have we created jobs for almost 300 military spouses and veterans, many of whom have moved with the military and with WWC Global many times, but we are also one of the largest women-owned small businesses here in the Tampa Bay area, and the second largest privately held government contracting firm in the region. WWC Global is proud to have won the largest government contract award to a woman- owned business in US Special Operations Command history here in Tampa. Congratulations. Thank you. All of this because me, my co-founder, Donna Huneycutt, and so many other talented professional military spouses wanted to obtain meaningful employment in Naples Italy so many years ago. We realized that, much as we may want to, WWC could not hire all of the talented military spouses around the world. Although we’re still trying. In 2010, we launched a nonprofit called In Gear Career, now part of the Hiring Our Heroes program, to give back to this incredible population that it helped us grow. We also started Homefront Rising, an annual training program to help military spouses get engaged in the political process across the political spectrum. Military spouses are four times more likely to be unemployed or underemployed than their civilian counterparts. A 24% unemployment rate pre-COVID. This is a staggering number, but hiring military spouses, isn’t simply the patriotic or right thing to do. Hiring military spouses is good for our economy, it’s good for individual businesses and it’s good for our force readiness. Military spouse employment, done right, impacts all of the other issues that we’ll talk about here today. Mental health, transition, quality of life, all get better when military spouses are afforded the opportunity to contribute their intellect, ingenuity, and professional background to our communities. Mr. Vice President, thank you for what you and Dr. Biden have done for all military families, the Joining Forces initiative, profoundly impacted efforts around military spouse employment, and other military family issues. Thank you for inviting us here today. Thank you for what your company has done. Look, you all know this because you’re veterans and many of you have spouses, and not all of you, I don’t want to presume anything. But the fact is that one of the things that was, I found, particularly difficult when watching what happened during the heavy deployments back in Iraq and Afghanistan, before I was able to get permission to bring home 150,000 troops, was that a significant portion of those troops were either reservist or national guard. They did not have the comradery of, if they stayed back on the base, at least with other people being in the same circumstance. What I found was as we traveled around the world and around the country, is that the lack of a sense of being understood, what’s happening, just being able to know that somebody else knows what you’re going through. That sense of loss, even if everything’s fine, even if your husband or wife is in good physical shape and safe where they’re ever deployed. But this idea that you’re still … Every night, you’re taking care of the homework by yourself, or you’re the only one being able to go to the school play, or you’re the only one there for the birthday and no one’s there. I mean, it does impact on family solidarity. It does impact on a sense of community, which you have. My wife was part of an organization in Delaware called Boots on the Ground. I don’t know if you’re familiar with it at all, but what that was, and just in my small state of Delaware, and if I’m taking too much time, tell me because I’ll stop. But what I found was that I remember my daughter-in-law calling the first snowstorm after Beau was deployed, and she said, ” Nana, somebody is out there shoveling the driveway.” This was up the snowstorm, “Shoveling the driveway, and I didn’t call them. They left a note saying, “Thanks for the service. Thanks for your service. Or things like, when someone’s deployed and you’re off base, even when you’re on base, but you’re off base, find yourself in a situation you have to show up for a mammogram, or you follow up on something having to do with a health problem, who takes care of the kids? I mean, what happens? Well, they started this whole thing in Delaware where people would show up, people would just volunteer, they’d give phone numbers and say, “I’ll be there,” and show up. The only reason I’m bothering to say this, and you know it, but I want the people to understand it, it does help with the psychological health, the sense of community. You didn’t volunteer to serve, all of you, to get thanked. … it’s here to serve all of you, to get thanked. You volunteered to serve because that’s who you are, you’re not used to saying, “Thank me, I did something special,” but it matters when you know people know what you’ve done and they’re just generically supportive of what you did, respect you for it. I’m always happy to take her calls. … to begin and reignite, joining forces again than she and Michelle had done. So… But, thank you. That’d be amazing, thank you. Next we’ve got [Deshaun Heinz 00:00:45], who’s going to speak to us as well. Thanks, Lauren, I appreciate it. Yes, sir, it’s an honor to meet you. By the way, when my son got promoted to major and got the Bronze Star I said, “Congratulations, you’re now a field-grade officer.” He said, “Dad, I know who runs the military, sergeants.” So, who are field-grade officers? But anyway… So, especially in Marine Corps. Excellent. It’s an honor, I know you hear that a lot, but I really truly mean that. As a… Again, my name is Deshaun Hienz, I served in the United States Marine Corps. And I… After the Marine Corps, I decided to come here to Hillsborough Community College and get my associate’s degree, and I went on to the University of Tampa to get my bachelor’s degree, so I’ve been around education ever since I got out of the military. Luckily they found that I was great with veterans, so that’s why I decided to come here and work with them. As an academic advisor, excuse me, the veterans education is a big part of my life now. And I think that our current VA education system is great, but one of the fears that I have is that they may not be keeping up with the times and that they may fall behind in regards to evolving with veterans. As you probably know, there’s a lot of veteran owned businesses now and that’s because we have great entrepreneurship programs that are starting to come out of colleges, such as the one we have here with Hillsborough Community College ran by Dr. Andy Gold and Beth Kerly, to where they can have a veteran go from idea to actually starting and making sales in just four months. One of the concerns I have is, after they have their company, they may not… A lot of them don’t come back to finish their education and their VA [inaudible 00:26:17] sits there. And I was… One of the things that we had mentioned was, if there was a way that we can possibly get it to where they can maybe use the benefits that they’re not going to be using for education to fund their business if they don’t come back to use it, so I was wondering if you in essence were thinking about that or about the VA education. Another issue was, which you had touched on in your speech, was veteran suicide. As you know, we’ve all heard the term the 22, and it hit home personally to me where I had a young Marine named [Frank Smith 00:00:26:48], who had… Went to a VA hospital, who was already getting assistance with healthcare and with mental illness, and told them that he was going to leave and commit suicide if they didn’t help him, and unfortunately they didn’t, he walked out and ended up committing suicide. So, I know a lot of people talk about doing something or stopping it, but it seems like it’s still a big issue, and so I appreciate what you had said on how you’re going to take action behind trying to stop this pandemic. [crosstalk 00:00:27:16]. Well, look, there’s a couple of things. And again, tell me if I’m telling you more than you want to hear, okay? Because I know you all know all of this. But first of all, one of the things we’re finding is that… I used to have a friend who was a great basketball player years ago, back in the days when Providence College had those great teams, and Riordan, and Walker, the… All pros, ended up being all pros, were on that team if you’re a basketball fan. And his name was Pete. And Pete was not that interested in academics, but he was a smart guy, and he used to have an expression, he said, “You’ve got to know how to know.” I can take you into the Library of Congress and if you don’t know how to read the card catalog using the community, very little value to you, all those thousands and thousands of books. Well, I find the same thing, and it didn’t start off in the context of veterans, but I found the same thing with entrepreneurs. There’s an awful lot of entrepreneurs, and you see what’s… Well, I won’t go into that. But an awful lot of entrepreneurs, and it started off dealing with minority entrepreneurs, who given the opportunity or as successful as any other group of entrepreneurs. That’s why Barack and I started this program for giving money to state small business associations that they could then fund and bring from the… Outside the federal government, bring in, attract private funding to help people get started. Well, what I was amazed about when I read about your program down here, is you provide the kind of help that knows teaching how to know how to know. They may not know that they need this particular accountant, or they may not know how to get in contact with a lawyer to get the documents that are needed to be done, they may not know the detail because most of the big banks don’t like leading to small operators. And so, what you’ve done here is that you in fact have provided for these young entrepreneurs and these military entrepreneurs, you’ve sort of shown the way. I don’t mean take them by the hand and say, “Come on now,” they’ve got great ideas, but they don’t know the system well enough. Their ideas are as good as anybody else’s idea, and if they get the chance to get them the infrastructure set up to be able to start whatever that entrepreneurial effort is, they can do very well, but they don’t know how. And that’s what I was so impressed about what Hillsborough does here, or you all do here. What I haven’t… What I don’t know, and I’ll be very blunt with you because it didn’t occur to me until we set up coming down here and I learned about the program, I don’t know how we can move. Yes, sir, in essence, so that if they can be able to get a lump sum of that, of course not the full amount that it will be over the course of four years, but it was [crosstalk 00:30:58]. And the answer is, the service of these young women and men is not over, but they… We need their talent, leadership, and their experience, but… So, from 9/11, the protect Post-9/11 and Forever GI Bill benefits, we got to on the one hand crack down on a fraud or the for-profit outfits out there that are trying to take advantage, and figure out how these vets can get access to training and placement, but also can they use it for their business? I have to give you an honest answer, I’ve not thought of it. And I promise you I’ll pursue it and I’ll get back to you and tell you whether or not mechanically that can be done or is it better to go straight to what I already have set up, the small business enterprise proposal. For example, the $1 billion, $500 million, we put aside for entrepreneurial encouragement brought $30 billion from the private sector. My proposal is to raise that to a $15 billion, this goes to the states now, a $15 billion SBA [inaudible 00:32:11] to states. That’s likely to build and may be somewhere between… Close to $150 billion off the sidelines. That may be the better way to do it and still preserve the ability to come back and finish that degree, because no matter what is said, even in your entrepreneurial business you can still at night, if it make sense to… Can complete the degree. But I don’t know the answer, I’ve never thought of it before, I must tell you, about using VA benefits to provide for the entrepreneurial enterprise you have underway. And if you have… If it’s… I forget what the tuition here is, it’s actually quite low here compared to other universities, other community colleges. [crosstalk 00:08:52]. But, would you be able to use that? Now, the other complication, I must tell you is, if I’m elected, I promise you that we’re going to make sure, and there’s the votes to do it, to provide for free community college for anybody who qualifies across the board. So there would be no… The question is, well then, how would that work? You follow me? So, I promise I’ll have my guys get my… Actually, the woman who runs this, get in touch with you, and we’ll see if I can work something out and I’ll get back to all of you as to what my position is. But, I think it may be better to go directly through the existing program than to do it that way, but I’ll look at it. Yes, sir, thank you. Deshaun, you guys are doing amazing work here and I see it in the entrepreneurial infrastructure here in Tampa, here in Hillsborough County and across the state, you guys are doing amazing stuff, so thank you. But it really is amazing. I mean, you just have to know how… Little things like, how do I go about getting a license for this? Where do I go do… You have the idea, that doesn’t in any way undercut your new idea on IT or your new ID on whatever, because… But, how you get there, point me, tell me what I need to do to get it done. I was impressed. Next we’ve got [Elena 00:34:12] and [McCullough 00:34:13] to speak. Thank you, sir. Hello. Yes. So, I wrote a little story to tell you about my military career. I was born and raised in the Dominican Republic. When I was 16, my family sent me to live with my aunt and uncles in California and I had the opportunity for having an opportunity to have a better life. On the week of my 18th birthday, I joined the United States Coast Guard and I served for 24 years. I started as enlisted, and I did 14 years as enlisted, and then I had… I became a lieutenant and I kept serving in my country. The highlights of my careers are [inaudible 00:35:14] major interdiction operation in the Caribbean and maritime efforts in the WTO in Miami. So, I was very proud of my military career, but I have one issue that I have been talking to a lot of people on, they’re very concerned about it, and it’s Social Security. It’s a crucial program for millions of hardworking Americans, including veterans. Florida, is home of the second most military retirees in the country. We have contributed to Social Security our entire lives, and with the expectation that we will retire and if we become disabled, Social Security will be there for us. But now, President Trump is threatening to defund Social Security by cutting the payroll tax. So, many retired veterans depend on Social Security. Part of the reason that… That’s why we’re supporting you, because you will protect Social Security, and I can’t imagine an alternative. That’s why we are working so hard to make sure that we have you as our president. Folks, this is both simple and complicated. Number one, you all know the way the Social Security system has been funded because you’ve been paying into it your whole lives, and it’s essentially 6.5% of your salary, and your employer pays 6.5%, and that’s how the Social Security system is funded, it’s a little more complicated but that’s the essence of it. What the president is… What we did by the way, when Barack and I got into… President Barack Obama and I got into office, is that we inherited the most significant recession, short of a depression in American history. And so, we decided that we had to do things to spur the economy and have economic growth. One of the things we did was to get money immediately into the hands of folks who had a job still and a paycheck by deferring their Social Security payment, but we had written into the law a affirm commitment that the government would, when crisis was done, would make up the entirety of that so there’d be no diminishment of the amount of money in the fund to be able to pay for this. Now, the president… I don’t want to sound… Well, I’ll just say it. The president has focused on, the reason why the COVID crisis has been so bad, he has focused only on making sure the stock market stays up and to make sure it doesn’t decline because then it looks bad and the economy begins to drop for the very people that he most represents. And so, one of the ways… But, the Congress has passed legislation to provide for significant help for working families so that they would be able to, for example, have the ability to not be able to be thrown out of their apartments and the government would pay for that until the recession is over if they didn’t have the money. Well, there’s 20 million people in America, awful lot of Latinos here as well, in the state, because they have 50% of Latinos own homes, they find themselves in a position where 20 million Americans are on the verge of having to worry they’ll be foreclosed down because they can’t pay the mortgage payment. And all that money is in this act that’s been passed in the Senate and support… I mean, the House. With some Republicans supporting and some Republicans supporting in the Senate, but Mitch McConnell, the Senator from Kentucky is the Majority Leader, won’t bring it up to be voted on. And the president is unwilling to figuratively and literally speaking, get off his golf course and out of his sand trap and call a meeting in the Oval Office, for real. Have you ever heard of a time in a crisis like this the president has not called together the factions of the Senate and the House to come and try to settle something this consequential? I mean, for real, hasn’t done it. But… So, he’s trying to figure out ways in which he can in fact, I’m sorry for the explanation but I think it’s important to know the context, whereby he can say those people will still have a job even though you have over 30 million people receiving unemployment now and that’s about to dry up too. Is that those who’ll get a paycheck will find they get their 6.5% that were taken out of the paycheck in their paychecks, so it looks like they’re going to get a pay raise. They’ll have more money to spend, which is not a bad idea, theoretically. But, he’s told… He said he wanted to make sure that the employer and employee stopped paying into the system because that would give them more cash available to deal with their issues. But the problem is, the actuary at Social Security, the professional said, “If they do that, within three years the system will be totally bankrupt.” We’re talking about hundreds of billions of dollars here that would have to be made up. How could you… So, all the things you paid into will be gone. So, the president is now saying that he’s just going to defer that being done between now and after the elections, so I guess it’s February 1st or something, he’s going to defer and say, “You don’t have to pay for that period of time your tax on for Social Security and Medicare. The problem is, it’s required that the day after that exemption runs out you got to make it all up. So, if the last… The fourth quarter of this year, you don’t pay… No one pays into the Social Security trust fund, all that money has to be paid up in the Social Security trust fund in the first quarter of next year. So, if people don’t know, particularly the military, they’re not going to know, on your military pay you’re going to have to pay, have to come up with in the next quarter, twice the amount of money that was taken out of your paycheck before. You’re with me? Now, I doubt whether most people are going to take that money and be able to put it away and save it because they have such urgent needs, and so it’s going to be chaos. Now, a number of employers, and our moderator may know this, a number of employers are saying, “We’re not going to withhold it. We’re going to keep paying in because we don’t want to get hit with a 400,000 or 200 or a million, whatever [inaudible 00:42:40] how big the company is, bill next quarter. You’re with me? But this is all about, I’m making an assumption here, I can’t… But it seems as though it makes no fiscal sense. It seems to be all about trying to make it look like you’re doing something to help people in the middle of the COVID crisis when unemployment continues to go up, and when you have so many people out of work now, I think there’s 16 million have nothing at all. And to make it look like we’re actually helping some people that are in that struggling area to middle class area, it’ll put more money in their pocket now, and they say, “Oh God, he’s doing something to help me.” It’s like the one thing he wants passed, again, out of this next round that they’re still stalled on, is he wants to be able to send that $1,200 checkout per person, because he literally signs it, it has his name on it. He doesn’t want to do anything else, he doesn’t want to help state and localities in terms of running their deficits, dealing with them. I’ll end by saying, the reason I know a little about this is, when we hit the recession the president… President Obama asked me to see if I could convince my Republican friends to join us in what turned out to be an $800 billion recovery package that would be distributed within 18 months, and so that, in fact, we wouldn’t go into depression, even outfits like The Heritage Foundation, conservative think tanks, acknowledge it kept us from going over the cliff. And part of it was, he gave me the authority to run it, I was able to provide $140 billion over the 18 months to state and local governments, because the state government has to balance their budget. If you’re the mayor of this city, you have to have a balanced budget, you can’t run a deficit. And when you have a… When you’re running a deficit means you lay off school teachers, you lay off the fire department, or not the whole department, you lay off firefighters, you lay off police officers, you lay off first responders, you lay off doctors in the public hospitals, et cetera. And so, he’s refusing to do that, and the consequence he has to demonstrate he’s going to get something out there. You’re with me? And I think that’s what this is about. I just wish, and I really mean this, I wish he would in fact just say, “We’re going to call a meeting in the White House and we’re going to stay here till we get a deal done, Democrats and Republicans. Now, apparently there’s a lot of Republicans who are willing to get a deal, but apparently there’s 20 Republicans, very conservative members, who say they don’t want to spend any more money. And so, that’s the hard part, getting the majority of leaders in the spot that he [inaudible 00:21:44], but I want you to understand what’s not happening. There’s answers, the House has already passed this legislation to make sure that you’ll still get your Social Security, make sure Medicare is expanded. Like in this state, there’s not expanded Medicaid. Well guess what, you’ve got a lot of people losing their health insurance. And every other state out there, not every other but most other states, under the Affordable Care Act, the federal government will pay a hundred percent of the money for Medicaid, which takes care of the poor, and then after several years pay 90%. But, a lot of Republican governors don’t like Medicare and Medicaid and don’t think the government should do it, so they don’t want to take on that responsibility for the 10% down the road. So, that’s… It’s all caught up in that. I hope that explains it, but I think it’s a big mistake and I think that we should… At least if the president has done this, which I think is a very bad idea, he should be honest with the public and say, ” But you’re going to have to pay this back in the next quarter.” So if you’re an E5 and you’re out there trying to keep your family going here and you’re paid… I mean, you’re still in the military but you’re home based. You got to know that, “God, that’s a little bit more money every month, every paycheck from military, but I’m going to have to double it going back.” I’m sorry it takes so long, but I think it’s important for people to understand exactly what’s going on. Thank you, sir. That was extremely comprehensive and extremely helpful. I’ll be less comprehensive, I’m sorry. I feel very passionate about this stuff, maybe it’s because I come from a family that… Dad didn’t have a job and we had to move and figure about the next meal on the table. Well, now, I’m going to turn to you Rev. Dr. Glenn Dames. Dr. And thank you, Mr. Vice President for being here… Dr. Well, thank you. And thank you, Mr. Vice President, for being here today. Thank you. Dr. I’m the Reverend Dr. Glenn B. Dames, Jr. I am the senior pastor of the Allen Temple AME Church here in Tampa and also a US Army veteran. I’m excited to have you here today, and I’m more excited to do everything I can to make sure you get elected to be the next president of United States of America. Just pray a heck of a lot. Dr. Mr. Vice President, I want to first say that your son Beau’s memory is still etched in our memory, and he was indeed no sucker or loser. He was the epitome of bravery and sacrifice. Thank you. Dr. And to this day, we still honor his memory and his sacrifice to our country and to his community. Mr. Vice President, when I was in the Army, I served as a mortuary affairs specialist at Fort Lee, Virginia, and I had the wonderful opportunity to serve at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology in Washington, DC at Walter Reed Hospital, where I got an opportunity to see firsthand the disparities, unfortunately, of African American veterans. And that’s one of the things that is passionate to me, is the disparities that exist in federal medicine, especially in the VA system, when it comes to African American vets. We fight so hard for things that should rightfully be ours. We’re always the first to volunteer to serve our country and community, and so I’m hoping that you can put together a plan, your team can put together a plan, to help bridge that gap, that disparity with African American veterans who have served their country honorably and deserve benefits to that point. Dr. I am currently working with a veteran who’s a member of my congregation. His name is Mr. David Hicks. He has been retired for 28 years from the United States Air Force, a Vietnam veteran, excuse me, because I get emotional, a Vietnam veteran, Agent Orange. And to this day, he is still fighting for benefits, 28 years after his retirement, after serving his country honorably. He is still fighting for benefits. Dr. And he and his spouse are both disabled. They have a son that’s taking care of the both of them, and they cannot get the benefits they need to make their ends meet. I think that’s abhorrent, and I hope that as president, you can do something to help expedite, bridge the gap, and help especially our African American veterans get the much needed care that they deserve from the VA system. Dr. And then secondly is veteran retooling. With all the layoffs that COVID-19 has caused, we found a lot of our veterans are having to look for reemployment. And as a result, Mr. Vice President, they need desperately to be retooled. And there’s not very many VA programs that can help them retool in this particular process, that I’m hoping Mr. Vice President, that you can and your team can put together something to help our veterans retool in today’s economy. Well look, first of all, your parishioner, congregant, is not alone. It doesn’t make it any easier. When you’re in that situation, you’re alone. It’s you, number one. Number two, I see two pieces to what you’re talking about here. The first piece is the gentleman you referenced has been out 28 years, is still fighting for access to service and his medical needs being cared for, having been exposed to Agent Orange. I was the original co-sponsor a long, long time ago. I got to the Senate when I was 29 years old, 30 years old, and right from the beginning generation, the whole fight was about Agent Orange. Some of you, none of you women are old enough, but a few of you men may be old enough to remember that the argument was that in order to be able to get veterans benefits, whatever ones that related to illness, what you had to be able to show is a direct causal relationship to that immune disease you may have and been exposed to Agent Orange, which science was not able to absolutely confirm precisely whatever year, whether it was a brain injury, or you had an auto immune disease, or whatever. They couldn’t prove beyond a reasonable doubt that it was caused by Agent Orange. Therefore, all these folks were left out. I started with some others, including eventually a great friend, John McCain, later on. But this program to say, all you have to do is show that you were in fact exposed to Agent Orange. It fell on top of your head, and millions and millions of tons of it dropped. And whatever illness you have that is inexplicable relating to your immune system, tumors, et cetera, would be presumed to be a consequence of the exposure. So you shifted the burden from the individual soldier or sailor or marine or coast guardsman to the military, to the government, to say, no, we have to pay for that. We have to provide the services. We have to provide all the backup. We have to provide the disability payments, because you were exposed. It took a long time to get it done. And you may remember when we finally with Barack, even though he wasn’t around for that war, he strongly supported it, and we increased that legislation. So there was a guarantee, basically. It also put the VA in real trouble, quite frankly, because all of a sudden you had thousands of veterans now eligible for the treatment at the VA. You with me? But we finally worked our way through that. That’s why I got to the point where one of the things you may remember, if you’re from the Iraq War and the Afghan War, is an awful lot of our military, we have more amputees per capita in these wars than we had since the Civil War. And why? Because of IEDs, improvised devices buried in the ground, and going by with a Humvee, just going by with a vehicle and getting blown up, and so many were dying. But what happened was there was an effort, there was a recommendation by some in the military that we could [inaudible 00:55:54] could save a lot of lives, but they’re very expensive. And the military wanted to spend the money on other needs they saw. But I became a, how can I say it politely, a royal pain in the neck to everybody on the Senate floor. And I constantly went to the floor, saying that we will be responsible for these deaths and amputations if we don’t act. We have something that can fundamentally change the effects on a soldier, a sailor, or anyone who’s blown up an IED with these new vehicles. And they’ve saved thousands of lives in the meantime. But what happened was as the president says, “They’re just headaches,” but traumatic brain injury is real. It causes significant physical consequences and psychological consequences, as well. And so what was happening, I wanted to make sure we didn’t go through another period like we did in that fight to finally get coverage for people exposed to Agent Orange after all those years. I didn’t want to have to go back and have a debate, how do we make up, so now, if in fact you can demonstrate you have traumatic brain injury, you have a brain injury problem, and you were in an area of concussion, it’s assumed it’s because of that concussion. You don’t have to go back and prove, no, I was there on this day. I was 300 yards from that IED and this happened, and I got approved, and I got a doctor to say that’s precisely why this injury occurred. And so we wouldn’t have to go through that again. But it takes me to the larger question you have. What about dealing with all the things that African Americans, military members or veterans, what about the fact that they get left behind, and they do for several reasons. Number one, if you are a African-American, whether it’s COVID on a military base, or you’re off base and you’re retired, you’re a veteran, COVID, you are four times as likely to come down with COVID and three times as likely to die if you’re white. That’s because of a lot of preconditions that exist. If you are Hispanic or Latino, the ratio is two to one and three to one, but it’s still much higher because of other exposures that exist, and the lack of ability to be in circumstances where your physical health has been able to be taken care of because you’ve had the insurance and the like for preventative stuff early on. So a lot of it has to do with everything from having diabetes to other problems that are complicated. That’s why you see so many people, white and Black and Hispanic and Asian Americans dying, because of preexisting conditions that are out there. So one of the things that we have to do is we have to focus on those veterans, and you’re talking about veterans now, African Americans who have had that exposure, that exposure to whether it’s COVID and/or anything else, because they’re in a position where they’re more likely to be susceptible. But one of the pieces of that is that if you are an African American veteran, the likelihood, although we’ve tried incredibly hard in our administration, and we significantly cut down the rate of unemployment of vets getting out, African Americans, is that that old thing is, to quote Barack, “There’s still systemic racism.” If your name is Joe, and I apply for the job, and you have the same qualifications I have, and your name is Jamal, I’m likely to get the job. It’s just a fact of life. And so what we’re not doing enough of is bringing in veterans, and you probably have it right here in your programs here at school. That seems to me you probably are emphasizing it and dealing with it. But the ability to, again, know how to know, the ability to find jobs and connect people with jobs. That’s what we spent a lot of time doing in our administration, getting, providing significant number of government jobs in the federal government. Because if you could take care, if you were a quartermaster, you can sure in hell take care of running a department store thing, and the second floor of the ladies’ department or whatever, you know what I mean? If you have been responsible for a couple of billion dollars worth of tanks, you can sure handle a distributing capacity for, I don’t know, FedEx. You can do it. And so trying to connect the veteran retiring with helping them understand what their training in the military most qualifies them to be part of, to know where to start looking, to know where to try to connect people. And that’s part of what I think the VA has to do more of, not the health side of it, but the connection side. Again, our moderator, you probably do that already in your business, but people don’t realize that I have this skill. That skill may not work very well for me to go in and be a salesperson, but it may work very well for me to be a warehouse manager. It may be a place … You understand what I’m saying? And so, Doc, what we ought to do is talk a little bit about, and I’ll get my people on the line with you, you may be able to be specifically helpful, and you may, as well, from here, specifically helpful in the kinds of things that are already available that people don’t know are available. But explicitly what is more helpful, and by the way, white guys with high school educations come out and they’re having the same kinds of problems, and not as bad, not as bad. It’s just worse for minorities. And I’m happy to go through with you in some more detail what kinds of initiatives are available, so you can help. For example, if I were still a Senator, if I were still, I can do it anyway, you ought to get us in touch with your individual you’re talking about and see if we can do a little bit of casework here and guide a little bit, but larger than that, that’s one person, larger than that, we have to expand the access to these programs that connect a veteran with their most likely area of employment. They may say they want to go and I don’t know, do whatever, but it may not be their skill that they acquired in the military may not in any way enhance that piece. Am I making sense? Dr. You are. Okay. All right. Sorry. And there are some great [crosstalk 01:03:42]. You’ve got to ask me some easy questions here. I don’t think anyone’s going to ask you any easy questions, Sir. So there are some great programs out there, both government, but also nonprofit, that are doing that. And it’s a good thing, because we are getting better. The next person that we have is Elliott Steele. Good afternoon, Mr. Vice President Biden. My name is Elliott Steele. I’m a veteran, and both my parents were veterans. My wife and I are founders of Vincent House, Florida’s first internationally accredited clubhouse for people with a mental illness. As we all clearly know, if someone experiences an injury, heart attack, or prosthesis, they go through physical therapy to learn to walk on that uneven sidewalk, get their stamina, self esteem, and self confidence back, and then they’re successful at returning to work and having a purpose in life. Before Vincent House, veterans and other people with mental illnesses in Florida did not have that opportunity. Vincent House is a clean, safe, restorative community, as it’s built upon respect and dignity, something people with a mental illness rarely experience. In addition to the opportunity to practice work, participants, called members, can find a purpose in life through voluntary work running the clubhouse and relationships developed with staff and other members. As a veteran myself, I wanted to ensure veterans were included from the beginning almost 18 years ago. We had veterans from Bay Pines VA visit us weekly and participate in our work order day. Many became members, and membership is for life. Since inception, our members have collectively earned over seven and a half million dollars working real jobs in the community. Many of these members were written off by their doctors, department of vocational rehabilitation, their families, and in sometimes themselves, as unemployable. Even more importantly, they have broken that cycle of perpetual patient. Vincent House has grown into two additional counties, with the most recent one in [inaudible 01:06:04] County having their ribbon cutting tomorrow. Additionally, there are now 11 clubhouses in the state of Florida. There are over 300 international clubhouses in more than 30 countries. 200 of them are in the United States. My goal when you become president is to assist your team in providing increased mental health funding to offer veterans and other people with mental illnesses the opportunity to become a member in a clubhouse in their own community. Just a short example of one of our many veteran members, a Vietnam vet decided to go back to school. He got his masters with honors. He’s a certified addictions counselor. Today, he does a weekly Double Trouble program for our members, and Double Trouble is a program, a 12 step program for people with mental illnesses and addictions. So he’s giving back to the clubhouse. And I thank you for this opportunity to share with you Vincent House. Elliott, thank you. Look, as my mother would say if she were here, “You’re doing God’s work, kid. You really are.” You know, we’ve learned an awful lot in the last decade about a lot of things relating to health and wellbeing. One of them we learned is that the double addiction of mental health and substance addiction, we always thought that mental, excuse me, physical addiction to a substance caused mental illness. Not so. Other way around. And so we found that out now, and that’s why one of the things is not what you asked, but I’m just going to make the point of it, though. One of the things that we have to do is, speaking of schooling, we used to in our public school system have school psychologists in the school, social workers and folks who, school nurses. But now we only have one school psychologist for every 1,570 kids. Even though we now know that mental problems, it starts off with anxieties that exist, in fact, generate drug addiction. And so by putting psychologists back in the school system, we can identify early an entire generation that is dealing with serious, serious uncertainty about their state of security. For example, the generation between seven years old and 17 years old is more at risk than any generation in the history of the United States in terms of anxiety. Why? Because they see mom and dad splitting, they see this crazy thing of everybody’s home. There’s increased domestic violence, because people are staying home. There’s increased child abuse, there’s increased whole range of things. And so one of the ways to get ahead of this, so there’s not as many Vincent Houses that are going to be needed 20 years from now, is catch this early to keep kids on track. And we find out when you have that occur, and you put these three, four, and five year olds in school as opposed to in daycare, they increased by 58% the prospect they’ll go all through 12 years of school without running addiction problems and/or mental health problems. But having said that, what you’re talking about is incredibly consequential. When Barack and me, when we pushed the Affordable Care Act, we insisted that there be mental health parity. Whether you have a mental problem, a disease, it’s a disease of the brain, any more than you go out and you break your arm or your back or your leg. And it has to be treated the same way, accommodated by the insurance companies the same way you would if you walked in and said, “My insurance covers my broken leg.” It has to cover the mental health treatment you get. But in addition to that, we are so short across the country, as you know, with community mental health centers, with access to mental health, period, that one of the things I call for is a multi-billion dollar investment in community health centers. But secondly, making sure that we are in a position that nonprofits like you guys are a major part of the operation of bringing people into this ambit, this gambit we have here. Look, there is an [inaudible 01:11:12] called the Wounded Warriors. They had that march across the United States. These are brave women and men, and both American and European and out of England and other places, that literally marched across the United States. My wife and I spent two days with them doing part of it. And the whole purpose was to say, “Look, I was the guy, I was the woman that did the following, but I have a mental health problem. Help any more than you should be ashamed if you went and you broke your arm or you needed glasses or whatever it was. And so one of the big things that we started to do, was making some progress, and you’d know better than anyone is we made an effort in our administration to take the stigma off of seeking mental health assistance. Number one. Number two, what you’re doing is providing a community for people who have gone through similar circumstances, and now know, “I’m not alone. I’m not the only one did this happened to. I shouldn’t be ashamed.” And by the way, sit down and it’s like AA, the 12 step program or whatever. Okay, here’s how others have done it, and every once in a while when they fall back to say, “No, no, no, no, come on back. We can do it. You can do it.” It requires that old overused phrase. It takes a village to raise somebody. Well, to deal with someone dealing with both a mental health problem or addiction problem, it takes a bit of a village. You got to have support. And the support that is most helpful most of the time are people who are in recovery. And I mean mental health recovery, as well as addiction recovery. And by the way, this whole notion of dealing with the idea that … Look, more vets are dying, and active duty military, are dying of suicide than all the veterans, all the military, that had been killed in wars or conflicts since 9/11. Think of that. More people are dying by suicide, mostly with getting access to a gun and blowing their brains out, then died in conflict and military conflicts since 9/11. And so it is a sad, sad thing. And since only 1% of the population went to fight anyway, and of that 1% there is this percentage who in fact are committing suicide on a daily basis, 22 or so, I think. It depends very slightly every day. It’s like it’s somebody else’s yard. It’s not me. It doesn’t affect me. You don’t know it until you know somebody who it happens to, or it happens to somebody that is your neighbor. And so one of the things … We have to deal with a number of things. What we did when we were dealing with the mental health issues, Elliot, is that we said it was the same as … Had to be treated with priority with every other health problem, but PTSD and traumatic brain issues compounded the issue, and the VA is best equipped to help navigate this. We boosted funding for VA for this purpose by 76% in our administration. And we got to build on that. As I said, the whole vet, mental health jobs and community ties. It’s not just enough to do one of them. There has to be someplace where I say, “I’m back, I belong, I know what I’m doing.” And we have to expand access to telehealth as well, because a lot of people live in communities that are rural, and they have these needs. And just getting on a computer looking at and talking to a doc can make a big … I’m telling you what you know more about than most people. Most important thing to me is, as it relates to the VA, we got to end the wait times, no matter what it takes. And that’s why we have to make it more competitive and make people want to. We have an overall shortage of psychiatric nurses, an overall shortage of psychiatrists and docs who deal with this, and psychologists. And it’s something that we should be encouraging in terms of how we provide access to universities and funding for people to get these degrees. Just like if we were short on engineers, we’d be out there saying, “Well, we need to have more engineers out there and we’re going to fund how to get them.” So I know that that’s not a complete answer, except you know one thing, that I’ve observed anyway, a number of these facilities that I visited relating to the military. Half of it is just, figuratively and literally, touching this vet. I’m not joking. Just half it’s just touching it. I’m here. We’re here. There’s a way. Because the despondency … And one of the things that the US … I think this is true. I’m unsure of my source. So I want to be clear because the press is here and they were right to correct what I say if I’m wrong. But there’s an overwhelming assessment by the medical community writ large, that we’re in a period of greater uncertainty and unease with a combination of COVID. Approaching 200,000 people dead, roughly 1000 a day dying. The loss of being near depression heading, if we don’t figure out how to get this thing going again and open safely. All those parents home trying to figure out how my kid’s school was not open. I’m making seven bucks an hour. If I stay home, I lose everything. If I don’t stay home, who takes care of my … The anxiety that the American people are feeling, including people that are well off, is extreme. And so we’re going to have to focus on this. There’s going to be real fallout from this. And let me end by saying, that’s why I think it’s important that we level with the American people. I noticed the president was quoting Roosevelt and Churchill. That doesn’t surprise me if he says he’s the best president for blacks since Abraham Lincoln. Actually he was better. I guess he’d think that. But anyway, the point is that Roosevelt, when World War II started, said after Pearl Harbor, said, “It’s going to get worse and worse and worse until it gets better and better and better.” And the American people can handle anything if you give it to them straight from the shoulder. False promises, not leveling with how tough things are going to be. The American people have never failed to step up to what had to be done when it had to be done. But that’s not happening now. I am, ironically, more optimistic about the prospects of dealing with the problems we talked about today, as well as so many other problems we have right now than I’ve ever been in my whole career. And they say, “Well, why in the hell would you say that Biden? You just talked about all these difficulties.” Well, I’ll tell you why. Because the American public, the blinders have been taken off. They’ve all of a sudden seen a hell of a lot clearer. They’re saying, “Jeeze, the reason I was able to stay sequestered in my home is because some black woman was able to stack the grocery shelf. Or I got a young Hispanic is out there, these dreamers are out there, 60,000 of them acting as first responders and nurses and docs.” Or all of a sudden people are realizing, “My Lord, these people have done so much. Not just black, white, across the board, have done so much for me. We can do this. We can get things done.” And I think they’re ready. And the irony of all ironies is that I think the vehicle by which we’re going to be able to create really good paying jobs. We’re going to be able to provide for significant healthcare. The idea that in the middle of a pandemic, the worst thing since the great flu back in the turn of the century, where so many people died worldwide, is that people are figuring out that we’re all in this together. We can get through this if we just level with one another. Just tell the truth, let people know. And I think for example, all of a sudden people are focusing an awful lot on a global warming. Don’t have to tell Florida about global warming. I’m not joking. Look what’s happened just west of here. My state is the lowest line state in terms of sea level of any state in the union. We have … President talks about how suburbia is going to be ruined by integration or whatever the heck he’s saying now. Well, guess what, they’re going to be ruined because they’re going to get blown away. They’re going to burn out of their neighborhoods. They’re going to have in the Midwest these floods that are wiping out entire neighborhoods. Down here, hurricane. And so people are sort of saying, “Whoa, science matters.” They don’t know, nor do I necessarily know all the science, but they go, “Whoa, our health is at stake and there’s things we can do.” They’re figuring out in the process the very things we have to do to deal with all these problems. Guess what it does? It provides employment, it provides good paying jobs. People out there making a windmill, are people making prevailing wage, not 15 bucks an hour, to overstate it. Anyway, I just think there’s a gigantic opportunity. I’ll conclude and get out of your hair by saying that I was asked by a foreign leader, “Can you define America for me?” And I told him, “Yeah I can. In one word.” Seriously, think about it. Possibilities. The United States of America is the only nation in the world that’s thought anything, anything is possible. We set our mind to it, do it together. And I think the public’s ready. I think they’re ready to get engaged. I think they’re ready to get engaged. We can generate real economic growth, provide significant opportunity to people. Education matters, healthcare matters. Having access to healthcare is a right, not a privilege. Making sure that you have access to employment. All those things. I think people would like … The blinders have been taken off. So as my grandpop would say, “With the grace of God, the goodwill of neighbors and the creek not rising, we can get a lot done. Sir, we have one more person. Oh, I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. [inaudible 01:23:59] No, no. I’m so sorry. [crosstalk 01:24:03]. No problem. [inaudible 01:24:04] General Haddad. I’m sorry. Fire away. Hey Mr. Vice-president, it’s an honor to be here with you, and thanks for the opportunity to be [crosstalk 00:12:12]. Thanks for the opportunity to be here at this round table, or I guess more appropriately, it’s a rectangular table. But real quickly, a little bit about me, and then I’ll get into what I want to talk about. I’m a proud descendant of Lebanese immigrants. I grew up in a small little copper mining town in Arizona. I played football at the Air Force Academy, hence the nickname Beef. I had more hair, was a little larger back then. Sir, we met in 2016 as a matter of fact. Where’s it at? I got your coin right here. Oh I owe you a drink. So I graduated in 1981. I flew C130’s primarily special operations, gunships, and Talons. I deployed to the desert eight different times beginning in Desert Storm, and I amassed a few hundred hours of combat time. I’m most proud of commanding a deployed special operations squadron that racked up thousands of hours in Iraq and Afghanistan without one accident, and still one of the most highly decorated units in the air force reserve. After 40 years of wearing the uniform, I retired in 2016 as the vice commander of the air force reserve command. And incidentally, my wife has served for 25 years in the Air Force. She’s a JAG and she thinks you and Dr. Jill are awesome. The Air Force brought me to Florida in 1985, and I’ve called it home ever since. As a resident of Florida and a military retiree, I’m concerned that oil drilling in the Gulf will negatively impact military operations. In 2006, Congress recognized the importance of restricting drilling in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico and a portion of the central Gulf. Congress enacted the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act, which is set to expire in June of 2022. Until last week, the current president proposed leases once the moratorium expired. As an election ploy, he has now announced he will support an executive order. I hope informed voters realize the executive order will be lifted if Donald Trump is reelected. These ranges provide the largest military training and testing ranges, and they are essential to our national security. This is the largest range in the continental United States. It provides more uninterrupted surface and airspace than all lower 48 States combined. These ranges allow us to develop and test conventional weapons and ordinance in a safe environmentally conscious manner. Failing to extend the Eastern Gulf moratorium will impact military readiness, preparedness, and will ultimately threaten our national defense. The 20 military installations in the state of Florida rely on the ability to have ready access to the golf ranges. The economic impact, to paraphrase our current president, is huge. 2018 defense spending accounted for $95 billion and 915,000 jobs in the state of Florida. Lastly, we cannot afford to allow drilling near our beautiful Florida coastlines. It creates the potential for a BP magnitude of oil spill, which would destroy coastal economies as well as military training and testing. We need a president who will protect our environment, especially when it impacts national security. We also need a president who will honor and support our men and women who don the uniform and not mock them. Vice president Biden, you and Dr. Jill have a record of taking care of our military and their families, and know firsthand what it’s like to have a family member serve in the greatest military the world has ever known. We need a president who won’t tolerate Russians paying bounties to kill American troops. We need a president who will use war as a last resort and not use the military as a personal security force. We need a president who will unify this nation, not divide it. We need a president who will rebuild alliances with our friends and not cozy up to evil dictators. These are not partisan or political issues, but issues of patriotism and love of country. We need to change on November 3rd. General, as you probably know, I’ve been a significant supporter of the moratorium, and I make it permanent relative to the base capacity that you have for testing. Otherwise, you’ve got to go way above Fairbanks to find a place where you can have live fire exercises, which I’ve been to as well. Look, I believe you’re absolutely right. The president made it clear he was going to lift the moratorium on offshore drilling. Most people only focused on the … Not only, but focused on the environmental impact of that happening, what that would mean. Especially since when we don’t need more fossil fuel, what we need is more renewable energy. But I strongly support, I can guarantee you if I’m president, there will be no offshore drilling, and I extend the moratorium. I think it should be basically a permanent moratorium. But particularly as it relates to … And it frightens people when I talk about the testing area. They say, “Well, I didn’t know that. I didn’t know they’re out there testing. They really shooting live ammo and things?” Yeah, you have to find someplace to do it. And it’s not doing the environmental damage that putting a well down there may do. And so I guarantee you, I haven’t changed my view from the time I supported the moratorium in the first place. It will stay as long as … I think we should try to make it permanent, absent the ability to find that no longer is there a need for that kind of practice, which I don’t see happening in any near term, in terms of being able to fly those missions and understand exactly how you train all these young women and men to be able to protect us. And so I strongly support your position. I’m not just saying it. You probably know that’s been my position for a long time, but I must admit to you, even if it were not, even we were not in a position to deal with having to deal with the military side of it, I think it’s a mistake environmentally. Especially at this time, we should be investing our money in renewable capacity, not eliminating tomorrow all fossil fuels, but making sure that we invest in the things that in fact can fundamentally alter the continent. Because you’re going to have … There’s a reason why all these hurricanes are coming. The water is getting a hell of a lot warmer off your coast in the Caribbean. And it’s getting awful warm also in the west, and El Nino. So I completely agree with you. And since I already made a closing statement, I won’t, but thank you for what you’re doing. And thank you for your service. It was a 711 [crosstalk 01:32:05] operation squadron. Yeah, yeah. You guys are amazing, man. They did amazing things during both Iraq and Afghanistan and they still do the amazing things today. They sure do. And by the way, the president’s met and talked with Putin six times and still hasn’t mentioned the bounty on the heads of Americans in Afghanistan, and the recent ramming of American vehicles by Russians in Syria, and injuring American soldiers. Not even mentioned. Sir, I can’t tell you how much we all appreciate the time that you’ve you’ve taken today. Really. I think I speak for all six of us here. Your commitment to the military is undisputed. And we really appreciate the time that you’re taking to address these issues. So thank you. Well, one last comment, actually, I think that … Look, I’m running for president as a Democrat. But I’m not going to be a Democrat president. I’m going to be an American president. And the one thing we’ve always had bipartisanship on is support of the military. Think about it. There’s been extremes in both parties, but support for the military, the sacrifices they make. And I can tell you, if I’m elected I’m going to spend as much time trying to help people that didn’t vote for me as those who did. So thank you so very much. Thank you very much. And I’ll be back to you on what we talked about, okay? The bad news is I show up when I’m invited. So, you’re poor relative … Well, like the poor relative. The poor relatives show up, eat all your food, stay longer than they should. The wealthy ones don’t come. I’m like a poor relative. I show up. So thank you so very, very much. Appreciate it. So we’re going to take a group photo. So if you just want to look at Adam right there and stand in front of the seats. Adam will wave his hand. [crosstalk 01:34:13] Leave your mask on. Yep. Ma’am [crosstalk 01:34:16] Yep, there we go. Okay."
"105","09-18-20"," Please welcome Senator Tina Smith. Please welcome Senator Tina Smith. There we go. All right. Good afternoon, everyone. I am so glad to be with you all. I want to thank the Carpenters for welcoming us to this amazing apprenticeship program. And I’m so excited to be here with Senator Klobuchar and Vice President Biden. We’re all here because we understand that, when people have the right to come together collectively to organize for better working conditions, better wages, safer places to work, they do better, their families do better, and everybody in this country does better. And, from what I’ve learned from talking to hardworking people all over Minnesota, is that what they want is the freedom and the opportunity to build the lives that they want. And they know that good jobs and their labor union helps them to do that. So, I think about what’s happening here in this amazing apprenticeship facility that the Vice President has had a chance to tour that is doing such great work. It is creating pathways for people to have good jobs and good careers with pensions. And this is what is so important for making this country work and making people’s lives work. We know what to do to make this country work for everybody, not just those that are at the top. It involves making sure that wages are good. We need a $15 an hour minimum wage. We need to make sure that we have paid family and medical leave. And we need to make sure that, when people work hard and they pay in, that they can count on their pensions being there when they retire. And this is a real challenge for a lot of folks these days. I’ve talked to folks in Duluth who told me that they had done everything right. They’d worked on weekends. They’d worked on holidays. They paid into their pensions. And now, they’re being told that those pensions might not be there. Think about what that means. A Woman said to me, she said, “Tina, I don’t have a plan B. I don’t have another thing to do here.” So, one of the things that I’m so proud to stand with Vice President Biden on and Senator Klobuchar is standing up for the rights of people to have the pensions that they earned. Now, as we think about this most important election, there’s no doubt about who is standing with working people in Minnesota and all across this country. And that is Vice President Biden. And that is where I stand as well in this most important Senate election. Now, a couple of days ago, Vice President Biden said, “I think this campaign is a choice between whether you’re for Scranton or whether you’re for Park Avenue. Is this campaign about Scranton or Park Avenue?” And I know which side I come down on. I come down on Scranton and I come down on the side of Vice President Biden. So, thank you all so much for being here. I’m excited to be a part of the celebration of the hard work and what that hard work can deliver for families in terms of the opportunities to build the lives that they want. Thank you so much. And now, Senator Amy Klobuchar. Well, hello, everyone. It’s wonderful to be here. Thank you to the Carpenters for hosting us. Thank you to my friend, Tina Smith, who’s doing such a great job. And I’m so proud to have her as a colleague and a friend, a real friend. People say friend in Washington all the time. But, for us, it’s true. And then also, to be here and welcome back Vice President Biden to Northern Minnesota. He has been here with me. He’s been up here with our steelworkers. He has been up here because he did such great work on domestic violence and came to Duluth to talk about it. And now, he’s here with the Carpenters. I was just talking to the Vice President backstage and recounting my background here. I think you all know, my dad grew up in Northern Minnesota. My grandpa was a miner. He worked 1,500 feet underground his entire life. He never got to graduate from middle school or high school because he had nine brothers and sisters. And it was unions that made my grandpa’s life safer. My dad still remembers those bodies in the Catholic church at St. Anthony’s in Ely because it wasn’t safe. Even when my dad was growing up, that was happening. And the unions pushed for safer rules and they pushed for better wages. And it’s one of the only reasons that I’m standing up here today. So, we know there’s something else going on in our country where we need someone to have our back. I am sick and tired of hearing Donald Trump say that he is somehow making us more safe. Well, we’re not safe when we have a pandemic raging across our country where I go visit my dad, who’s now 92, at an assisted living and he has COVID and I’m looking at him through a glass door like I was two months ago and I don’t even know if I’m ever going to see him again. That’s not safe. And it’s not safe when people are scared economically. And they don’t know if they’re going to have their job back. And what I love about Joe Biden and my friend Kamala Harris, is they’re looking not just how we get through this pandemic, but they’re looking the day after tomorrow and how we’re going to train our workers, what jobs we have available now, and what jobs we have available in the future. And we need a president who will fight for those who have lost their jobs because this administration is selling American workers out when we need to buy American. We need a president who will fight for the people and the workers of Northern Minnesota, not go down to Mar-a-Lago and tell all his rich friends, after he passes a tax bill, you just got a lot richer. I don’t think one person from Northern Minnesota was in that room in Florida when he said that. We need a president who knows that we don’t have a shortage of CEOs. We have a shortage of plumbers. We have a shortage of construction workers. We have a shortage of people that build things, that really build things. Joe Biden is going to be a president for all of America. And I was so proud to endorse him. After starting my campaign in the middle of a blizzard in Minnesota, I got to end it by endorsing Joe Biden. And I can’t think of a more joyful way to end a campaign. One last thing I want to say, it was the Obama, Biden administration that came up here in the face of Denis McDonough, the chief of staff of president Obama, and made sure we did something about Chinese steel dumping. They went to work. They enforced the laws. We passed some new laws. And a number of our iron ore mines reopened. It was their administration that got results. So, if you’re worried about your family and your job, you’ve got a home with Joe Biden. If you’re worried about the cost of prescription drugs or childcare, you’ve got a home with Joe Biden. And if you’re worried about the divide in this country and having a president that just keeps adding more fuel to the flames, you’ve got a home with Joe Biden because he wakes up every morning and thinks how can I lead this country and bring people together. So, luckily, just like the Carpenters, we aren’t afraid to roll up our sleeves. I have this vote mask because this is the first day of early voting in Minnesota. So, let’s go out there. Let’s vote. Let’s roll up our sleeves and get to work and elect Joe Biden as president of the United States. Thank you very much. And now, please welcome Carpenter’s Training Institute executive director, Matt Campanario. Matt Campanario. Well, thank you. I’d like to welcome all of you to the Jerry Alander campus of the Carpenters Training Institute. Our mission here is to prepare our 2,500 registered apprentices for a successful career as a professional in the construction industry. We also provide continuing education for all of our membership. Our partnering contractors rely on the continued success of our programs and our members in order to thrive. On behalf of the North Central States Regional Council of Carpenters, the Carpenters Training Institute, and our membership, I’d like to thank Vice President Joe Biden for taking the time to learn more about what the UBC members in our region do, and also hear what issues are important to us. Without further delay, it’s my pleasure to introduce Vice President Joe Biden. Hello, Minnesota. It’s good to be back. As Amy was saying, I’ve been here a number of times up in the Iron Range, and it’s a magnificent part of the world. Magnificent part of the world. And I want to thank you so much, Amy, Senator, you’ve been a great friend and a great, great Senator. And Senator Smith, you’re something else, I’ll tell you what. Thank you for the job you’re doing, and I’m counting on it continuing for another six years. I know you’re both fighting around the clock to take care of Minnesotans who are hurting in these multiple crises we face today. We have everything from COVID to unemployment, to a country that is being divided along racial lines. We have institutional racism we’re dealing with. A whole range of things. And the people of Minnesota know that they have two of the best Senators in the country on their side. And Matt, thank you so much for that introduction and for showing me around today, this incredible apprentice program here at the Carpenters Training Center. What a lot of people don’t know if they’re not involved with labor is the apprenticeship program not only trains the best workers in the world, I’m not being facetious, that’s a fact, but they get paid while they’re doing it. Not full wage, but they’re getting paid while they’re doing it. And that’s why these union apprenticeship programs are so, so critically important they stay this way. It matters. People who still make it while they’re learning a trade, a trade that’s going to put them in good stead the rest of their lives. It was great to see some of the practical hands-on experience that apprentices and journeymen and women here receive and while, as I said, earning a wage as a benefit. It’s a bit quieter here than usual because of COVID-19 restrictions, but the pride of these workers who are learning the skills that will carry them throughout their careers is still unmistakable. My father, and I apologize to the press who follows me for repeating this, but it warrants saying every time, my dad used to have an expression. He said, “Joey, a job’s about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in the community.” Then he’d end by saying, “It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, ‘Honey, it’s going to be okay,’ and mean it. That’s the lesson I’ve never forgotten. It’s the way I grew up surrounded by hard working families in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and a lot of steelworkers in Claymont, Delaware. All those jobs are gone now, those steel working jobs. And that’s what I saw here at this training center, dedicated women and men investing in their dignity. In their dignity. Here in the Iron Range, we can see the resilience and the grit, the communities that built America, the metal they’re made of. And fortified by the strength of union power, worker power. I think I was saying to you, Matt, that my dad had another expression, “The only way to deal with the abuse of power is with power,” and the only real power for workers in America is union power. You’re the folks who keep the barbarians on the other side of the gate, and making sure that people can make a decent living. And folks, but here like everywhere else, times are hard. Unemployment is way up due to the pandemic. Fewer workers can be on the job at one time in order to abide by social distancing roles. And the economic outlook for next year, including for the building trades, is more uncertain than it need be. Here in Minnesota and all across the country, there are plenty of folks who are hurting. They’re worried about making their next mortgage payment or keeping their rent payments in check. They see the people at the top of the heap doing very well. An incredible number: billionaires in America during this pandemic have made another $300 billion. Hear what I just said? In the middle of the pandemic. That’s been the entire story of Donald Trump’s presidency. Now, in the midst of this unprecedented national crisis, Trump has given up on even pretending to do his job. Almost 200,000 lives lost in the last six months. And experts tell us now, the same studies the administration’s relied on to predict what’s coming next, that we’re going to lose another 215,000 lives between now and January 1st. The United States has another 36,000 new COVID cases per day. Per day. Another average thousand deaths a day. Just across the border, figuratively speaking a stone’s throw into Canada, one day earlier this month, the United States had a thousand deaths from COVID, Canada had zero. Just two days ago, three days ago, I believe it was, America had 1,200 deaths, Canada had nine. Nine. So many lives lost unnecessarily because the President is only worried about the stock market and his reelection. He refused to do what you’re doing right here in this program, social distance, wear a mask, sanitize. You’re protecting your apprentices. He’s not protecting America. It’s estimated by the scientists that if we just wore masks nationally, we’d save a hundred thousand lives between now and January 1st. Let me say that again. If we just wore a mask nationally, we’d save a hundred thousand lives between now and January, according to the same study. And it was estimated by a great medical school, Columbia medical school, that if the President had just started one week earlier in March than he did, we’d have 36,000 more people sitting at the dinner table tonight, or being able to put your arm around grandpa or grandma tonight. And again, in his own words, recorded by Bob Woodward, the President knew back in February that this was an extremely dangerous communicable disease. Think about it. How many people across the Iron Range, how many empty chairs around those dinner tables because of his negligence and selfishness? How many lies said and lives lost? Imagine if he had just, Amy, on the State of the Union that year, spoke up and said, “We got a problem. We can handle it. Here’s what we got to do.” I can’t think of any president who’s ever acted, in my view, so selfishly, about his own reelection instead of a sworn obligation to protect and defend the American people. As I said last night in my hometown, I view this campaign as between Scranton and Park Avenue. All Trump sees from Park Avenue is Wall Street. That’s why the only metric of the American prosperity for him is the value of the Dow Jones. Like a lot of you, I spent a lot of my life with guys like Donald Trump looking down on me. Looking down on the people who make a living with their hands. People who take care of our kids, clean our streets. Maybe what bothers me most is when he talks about, reportedly talks about from too many sources confirmed by many outlets, when he’s talked about the men and women who join the military and gave full measure for their country as “suckers” and ” losers.” Unless you think it’s made up, remember how he talked about John McCain, a political opponent but a close friend who I did his eulogy. John McCain was no sucker or loser. He was a hero. My son who volunteered and spent a year in Iraq, won the Bronze Star [inaudible 00:11:27], he wasn’t a loser or sucker. He was a proud patriot. These are the guys who always thought they were better than me, better than us, because that a lot of money. Guys inherited everything they got and still managed to squander. I have to admit, which I guess is coming out and pretty obvious, particularly relative to Trump, I just have a little bit of a chip on my shoulder about these guys. … my shoulder about these guys. Recently, and I probably shouldn’t have said it last night, but I did, recently I read some stories and was asked questions by leading columnists. It went like this. “If you get elected, you’re going to be the first guy in a long time elected president without an Ivy League degree.” Like somehow a kid who went to a state university isn’t qualified to be president of the United States, doesn’t have an Ivy League degree? Let me tell you something. I know how to do the job of being president. It’s pretty clear. No matter how wealthy Donald Trump is, no matter how much he doctors his, if he does, his tax returns, he doesn’t have a clue how to be president. One of the lessons my mother taught me, not a joke, long time ago taught me and my siblings, it’s one that you probably were taught too out here in Minnesota. She said, “Joey, remember nobody’s better than you, but everybody’s your equal. Nobody’s better than you. Everybody’s your equal.” You don’t measure people by the size of their bank accounts. I don’t respect people based on how big the house they live in is. I don’t look down my nose when people are busting their necks just making a limit, nor do any of you. Trump says, by the way, I’m paraphrasing, everyone’s in the stock market. That’s why he cares about the stock market. What the hell is he talking about? People, I grew up in Scranton, Claymont, they don’t have money in stocks. Every penny we made was to pay the bills and take care of the families, putting clothes in the back, and a roof over our head. That’s why I have a different measure in which I judge the health of the American economy. And my measure is Scranton, Duluth, Harmontown, places where I grew up, that so many people I know grew up. I see hard working women and men who are just trying to earn an honest, decent living to take care of their families. I mean, just to have a little bit of confidence, a little bit of confidence, you can just see around the corner. And they don’t have to live literally from paycheck to paycheck. Most do. But hope for a little bit of space. Now the American people have seen these women and men, the essential workers, workers who stock the shelves in the middle of these crisis in the grocery stores, drivers who drove the trucks, delivered the food, farm workers, nurses who risk their lives, in many cases, gave their lives in the middle of this pandemic to save other people. Essential workers. And when they walk down the streets and people come out and clap pans and pots together, tell them how much they’re appreciated, that’s not enough. They’re not asking for anything, they’re just asking for a shot. I remind you, given a shot, the American people have never, ever, ever, ever let their country down. So it’s about time we start to pay essential workers for the fact that they’re essential. Blinders have been taken off the American people. I think they’re ready. They’re ready to insist that the minimum wage be $15 an hour. They’re ready to insist that people have childcare and access to it. They’re ready to admit and understand the needs that average Americans have. That’s why my Build Back Better plan, in fact, my entire campaign is built upon a simple concept. It’s time to reward hard work in America, not wealth. Reward work, not wealth. We don’t have to penalize wealth, it’s the opposite now. Reward wealth and not work. We’re going to have to rebuild an economy in the wake of COVID-19. And as we do, we have an incredible opportunity to make long overdue investments for working families. To make sure the wealthy, the very wealthy and big corporations finally began to pay their fair share. I’m not looking to punish anybody, just pay your fair share. It’s time we give hard working families who literally built the country through their skills and their sweat and the blood, like the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners, a leg up for once. I’ve a big ambitious plan that bets on the American worker. My plan is going to create millions of good paying jobs building the products and technologies that we need now and in the future. And it starts with a pretty basic idea. When the government spends taxpayers’ money, we should spend that money to buy American products made by American workers in American supply chains to generate American growth and opportunity. My plan would tighten the rules to make buy American a reality. During my first term alone, we’re going to invest $400 billion in federal money that you go out and spend, that I have control over as the president or an administration, to invest and purchase products and materials our country needs to modernize the infrastructure, to replenish critical stockpiles, to enhance our national security. I was just going through the apprentice program was one of your carpenters. And you’re showing me how to read blueprints. And I’m a frustrated architect. I just love building. My kids years ago bought me a Lightboard. I have no professional training, but I like and I carry around a graph paper. I’m always making up and designing homes and landscapes. It’s my way out. Some people can paint. I can’t. And you’re showing me the blueprints and how they can change several walls in a particular building to conserve and save energy. And he pointed out what you have to learn to be able to read a blueprint. I pointed out to him that my Buy American plan, he said, “By the way,” not me, this carpenter said, “And by the way, we can kill two birds with one stone.” He didn’t use that phrase. He said, “We can do two things at once.” He said, “We can improve the environment by using less energy to operate this building and create more jobs.” And I said, “I’m going to send you a copy of my plan. I sent a college note exactly what it is. My Buy American Build America plan calls for literally what we started in our administration and couldn’t finish, retrofitting four million buildings in America that are leaking millions of gallons of energy now. In the process, creating the four million jobs for skilled labor. Replacing windows, insulation that works, making sure that the unit is tight, including retrofitting two million homes. All of it done in a prevailing way with union labor, creating hundreds of thousands of union certified jobs. That’s not hyperbole, that’s a fact. That’s how it will happen. And saving millions of barrels of oil in the process, improving our environment. That’s why the IBEW and a lot of other unions support what we’re doing. We’re going to put in 500,000 charging stations along our highways. Why? So we can own, own, own the electric car market. Estimated creating a million new jobs in Michigan and Detroit in automobile industry. Look, we can outcompete anybody, we set our mind to it. My infrastructure plan is going to revitalize American infrastructure so the future is made in America. The president keeps talking about he’s going to invest in infrastructure, right? How many times has he said when you guys were there he had a plan in ’17, his infrastructure plan, it’s coming? Then he had one in ’18, then he had one in ’19, then he has one for ’20. Just like his nonexistent healthcare plan that’s coming next week. He has no plan. When I got started, this wasn’t a partisan issue, dealing with infrastructure. Republicans wanted to build solid infrastructure to make us first in the world, now we rank 28th, just like Democrats did. It was totally nonpartisan. And creating thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of good paying jobs. We’re going to invest over time two trillion dollars to build resilient infrastructure. Roads, bridges, ports, right here along with these great Great lakes. 1.5 million new affordable housing units, high speed broadband for every American household. More important than ever as we are educating our children from home because he has no plan how to open our schools. 100 billion dollars to rebuild crumbling schools. How many schools in America do you think there are where you can’t safely drink the water from the water fountain? Where they’re worried about whether or not there is enough ventilation in the school, where there is leaking energy or still has hazardous materials in the walls. It’s ridiculous. We should be spending the money to improve those schools and the safety of our children and our teachers. As I said, retrofitting four million buildings and weatherizing two million homes. And the way we do that is with the tax credits that we’re giving them again. All done by certified union labor. Look, I’ll fight for workers and unions at every step requiring all federal infrastructure projects to, one, pay prevailing wage, two, prioritize project labor agreements so collective bargaining is in place before the project starts, employee workers from registered apprenticeships. I won’t water them down like Trump tried to do. Pass the PRO Act to crack down on employers who are trying to block or break unions. And I’ll do it without raising anyone’s taxes if you make less than $400,000 a year. I gave my a word as … You have nothing to worry about if you make less than 400. This is why you have nothing to worry about if you make less than 400. If you make more, you’re going to start to pay your fair share. No who makes less than 400 is going to pay a single penny more in taxes under our administration. In fact, tens of millions of middle class families are going to get tax cuts when they need it most, while you’re raising your children, while you’re trying to get affordable healthcare, buying your first home or saving for retirement. Almost directly after President Trump passed his tax bill in 2017, almost two-trillion dollars, increased the deficit, he went down to Mar-a-Lago and he said to his guests there, and this is a quote, it’s on record: “You just got a lot richer,” end of quote. He was right. They got a hell of a lot richer. How about the person making 50, 60, or even the family making $120,000 a year? How much did you get? How much richer did you get? It may be the only time he’s told the plain truth, his entire presidency. In 2018, the year after that tax cut passed, 91 corporations in the Fortune 500 paid no income tax. Zero tax. Zero. Making billions of dollars, paid zero tax. He said he was going to lower the cost of prescription drugs. But guess what, instead of big pharma got billions of dollars in tax cuts, sent they’re manufacturing of those drugs overseas, so they’d be cheaper for them to produce, unconscionably raised the prices for ordinary Americans. How many of you people knew your mother’s, father’s, uncle’s, aunt’s, friend’s had to choose between getting the prescription, not a joke, and putting dinner on the table. Now he says he’s going to try to cut drug prices, like he’s going to have a healthcare plan. All he’s done in this big thing about, he’s calling it drug prices cut, all he’s done, he sent to the HHS, Health and Human Services, he said, “Study the issue. I have a clear plan. I guarantee I’ll lower prices in America for drugs by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, which he said he would do. The House and the Senate were ready to do it, and he said he’d veto it if he got it. If you want to participate in the Medicare program, you’ve got to negotiate with Medicare for the price of that drug, which is significantly lower prices. And for any new specialty drugs that don’t have competition that are launched, I’m setting up a review board to recommend a reasonable price based on the board’s evaluation, and that price will not be able to be increased beyond the cost of medical inflation unless they can prove they’ve gone and done some more research and change the nature of the drug. Now, astonishingly, astonishingly, and when my staff told me this, I know both the senators knew this, but when they told me this, I said, “He can’t be proposing this.” He now is proposing in this budget another multi-billion dollar tax cut for the very wealthy millionaires and billionaires. Here’s what he wants to do. He wants to lower the capital gains tax down to 15%. To 15%. Every one of you, including the reporters in this room, unless you’re making a lot more than I think you are, every one of you is going to be paying at a higher tax rate than someone making a billion bucks off their investment. You’re going to pay a higher tax rate, because they make their money by investing not by the sweat of your brow. Another tax cut worth billions of dollars. Whose hide do you think that’s going to come out of? Where’s it come from? The deficit is already bonkers. Where do you think it’s going to come out of? It’ll come out of you and the programs and things that help the American people. Like I said, it’s about time we start rewarding work, not wealth. Look, I’m not looking to punish anybody, but dammit, it’s about time the super wealthy and corporate America start paying their fair share. That’s all it is. Just pay their fair share so hard work and families can start getting a break on childcare, elder care, buying that first home, and the cost of education beyond high school, being able to get started in life. By the way, all of this is going on while Donald Trump is trying to rip away your healthcare. This whole con: “I got a new healthcare program. I’m going to protect pre-existing conditions.” He’s in the Supreme Court saying get rid of pre-existing conditions. They should not. They shouldn’t be able to stand in the way of you getting insurance because it helps insurance companies. And as a gimmick, he’s got a new one. He’s going to end the payroll tax that you pay in social security. Yet the actuary at the social security says if that were to occur, social security will be bankrupt by the middle of 2023. You may get a few more bucks in your paycheck, then go home and tell your mom and dad social security’s about to come to an end. They never liked social security and Medicare to begin with. Look, we can’t let this happen, that social security would run dry by 2023. We’re so much better than this. This United States of America. We have never, ever, ever, ever been unable to do something when we’ve done it together. Never. It’s time to stand up, Democrats and Republicans. I said it last night, and I know my colleagues know sometimes Democrats get mad at this, I’m running as a Democrat, but I’m going to be President of the United States, not President of the Democratic Party. We must unite this country. It’s the only way we can move forward. I believe the American people are ready for it. I believe in half a dozen to a dozen of our Republican colleagues, who’ve been unable and unwilling to have the guts to take him on because he’s so vindictive, with him gone I think they’re ready to work. Not on everything, but an awful lot. It’s time to take the country back, folks. It’s going to start here, today with voting in Minnesota. God bless you all and may God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."
"106","09-19-20"," We learned of the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who is not only a giant in the legal profession, but a beloved figure. And my heart goes out to all those who cared for her and care about her. And she practiced the highest American ideals as a justice, equality and justice under the law. And Ruth Bader Ginsburg stood for all of us. As I said, she was a beloved figure. As a young attorney, you all know the story. She persisted, overcoming a lot of obstacles for a woman practicing law in those days, as well as she continued on [inaudible 00:00:52]. She moved herself in a position where she could end up changing the law of the land in leading the effort to provide equality for women in every field. And she led to the advance of equal rights for women. It’s hard to believe, but it was my honor to preside over her confirmation hearing. I got to meet her at the time, and her ascension to the Supreme Court. In the decades since, she has been absolutely consistent and reliable and a voice for freedom and opportunity for everyone. And she never failed. She was fierce and unflinching in her pursuit of civil and legal rights, of civil rights for everyone. Her opinions and her dissent are going to continue to shape the basis for our law for a generation. And tonight and in the coming days, we should focus on the loss of her justice and her enduring legacy. But there is no doubt. Let me be clear that the voters should pick the president, and the president should pick the justice for the Senate to consider. This was the position the Republican Senate took in 2016 when there were almost 10 months to go before the election. That’s the position the United States Senate must take today. And the election is only 46 days off. I think the fastest justice ever confirmed was 47 days, and the average is closer to 70 days. And so they should do this with full consideration, and that is my hope and expectation what will happen. Thank you all, and I’m sorry. It’s such a … We had to learn it on the plane ride, but thank you very much."
"107","09-20-20"," Welcome to the nation’s Constitution Center. I had the great privilege of being a guest here. It’s an appropriate place to make the speech I’m about to make. I attended a mass earlier today and prayed for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and her family. The nation lost a heroine, an icon. They also lost a mother, a grandmother, and a matriarch. We know how hard that is, to watch a piece of your soul absorb the cruelty and the pain of the dreadful disease of cancer. I spoke to her daughter and her granddaughter last night, expressing my whole family, I mean, my whole family’s sorrow, particularly my grown granddaughters, one of whom was a student of Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s daughter at Columbia. They made clear to me, daughter and granddaughter, that until the very end, Justice Ginsburg displayed the character and courage we’d expect of her. They said she held their hands and gave them strength and purpose to carry on. It’s been noted that she passed away on Rosh Hashanah. By tradition, a person who dies during the Jewish new year is considered a soul of great righteousness. That was Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a righteous soul. It was my great honor, when I was in the Senate and Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, to preside over her confirmation hearings and strongly support her ascension to the Supreme Court bench. Justice Ginsburg achieved a standing few justices have or ever will. She became a presence in the lives of so many Americans and a part of our culture. I agree with what others have said, that she did as much to advance the constitutional rights, opportunities, and justice for women as Justice Marshall did for African Americans. Yes, there was humor and mentions of the Notorious RBG and her impressive exercise routines, but there was so much more. She was, to use an overused word, a trailblazer, a role model, a source of hope and a powerful voice for justice. She was proof, proof that courage and conviction and moral clarity can change not only the law, it can change our culture. It can change the world. And I believe in the days and months and years ahead, excuse me, she will continue to inspire millions of Americans all across this country. And together we can, and we will, continue to be a voice for justice in her name. Her granddaughter said yesterday and said publicly that her dying words were, “My most fervent wish is that I not be replaced until a new president is installed.” As a nation, we should heed her final call to us, not as a personal service to her, but as a service to the country, our country, at a crossroads. There’s so much at stake, the right to healthcare, clean air, clean water, the environment, equal pay for equal work, the rights of voters, immigrants, women, workers. And right now our country faces a choice, a choice about whether we will come back from the brink. That’s what I would like to talk with you about for a few minutes today. Within an hour of news of her passing, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said President Trump’s nominee to replace Justice Ginsburg will receive a vote in the Senate. Within an hour of her passing. The exact opposite of what he said when President Obama nominated Merrick Garland to replace Justice Scalia in 2016. At that time, Majority Leader McConnell made up a rule based on the fiction that I somehow believe there should be no nomination to the court in an election year. That’s ridiculous. The only rule I’ve ever followed relating to the Supreme Court nomination was the Constitution’s obligation for senators to provide their advice and their consent to a president’s judicial nominee. But he created a new rule, the McConnell rule. Absolutely no hearing, no vote for a nominee in an election year, period, no caveats, and many Republican senators agreed with him, including then Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Chuck Grassley of Iowa, including the current Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, who at the time said, and I quote verbatim, here’s what he said. “I want you to use my words against me if there’s a Republican president in 2016 and a vacancy occurs in the last year of the first term. You can say, Lindsey Graham said, let’s let the next president, whoever it might be, make the nomination.” Continuing to quote, “And you could use my words against me, and you’d be absolutely right.” End of quote. That’s what Republicans said when Justice Scalia passed away about nine months before election day that year. Now, having lost Justice Ginsburg less than seven weeks before the election this year, after Americans have already begun to cast their vote. It’s estimated that up to 40% of Americans will have voted by October 1st, but at least 30%. Tens of millions. And you can’t unring the bell. Having made this their standard when it served their interests, they cannot just four years later change course when it doesn’t serve their ends. Look, I’m not being naive. I’m not speaking to President Trump, who will do whatever he wants. I’m not speaking to Mitch McConnell, who will do what he wants, and he does. I’m speaking to those Republicans out there, Senate Republicans, who know deep down what is right for the country and consistent with the Constitution, as I stand here in the Constitution Center, not just what’s best for their party. I’m speaking for millions of Americans out there who already have voted and continue to vote, and we’ll have many more voted by the time this process is finished. Millions of Americans who are voting because they know their healthcare hangs in the balance. In the middle of the worst global health crisis in living memory, Donald Trump is before the Supreme Court, trying to strip healthcare coverage away from tens of millions of families. This took away the peace of mind of more than 100 million Americans with preexisting conditions. If he succeeds, insurers could once again discriminate or drop coverage completely for people living with preexisting conditions, like asthma, diabetes, cancer, and so many other problems. And perhaps most cruelly of all, if Donald Trump has his way, the complications from COVID-19, which are well beyond what they should be, it’s estimated that 200 million people have died probably by the time I finish this talk, the complications of COVID-19, like lung scarring and heart damage, could become the next deniable preexisting condition for over six million Americans who’ve already contracted the disease. Millions of Americans are also voting because they don’t want nearly half a century of legal precedent to be overturned and lose the right to choose. Millions of Americans who are at risk of losing their right to vote. Millions of Dreamers who are at risk of being expelled from the only country they have ever known. Millions of workers. Union workers who are at risk of losing their right to collectively bargain. Millions of Americans who are demanding that their voices be heard, that equal justice be a guarantee for all, not just some. They know, we all know, what should happen now. The voters of this country should be heard. As I said, voting has already begun. By the time we get to the middle of October, there will be millions and millions and millions who have already voted. In just a few weeks, all votes in this nation will be heard. They’re the ones who the Constitution envisions should decide who has the power to make this appointment. This appointment isn’t about the past. It’s about the future, and the people of this nation, and the people of this nation are choosing their future right now, as they vote. To jam this nomination through the Senate is just an exercise in raw political power, and I don’t believe that the people of this nation will stand for it. President Trump has already made it clear, this is about power, pure and simple power. Whether the voters should make it clear on this issue and so many others, the power in this nation resides with them, the American people, the voters, and even if President Trump wants to put forward a name now, the Senate should not act until after the American people select their next president, their next Congress, their next Senate. If Donald Trump wins the election, then the Senate should move on his selection and weigh the nominee he chooses fairly. But if I win this election, President Trump’s nominee should be withdrawn, and as a new president I should be the one who nominates Justice Ginsburg’s successor, a nominee who should get a fair hearing in the Senate before a confirmation hearing, before a confirmation vote, I should say, after a confirmation hearing. We’re in the middle of a pandemic. Like I said, as I speak, we’re probably passing 200,000 deaths lost to this virus. Tens of millions of Americans are unemployed. Healthcare in this country hangs in the balance before the court. And now, in a raw political move, this president and the Republican leader have decided to jam a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court through the United States Senate. That’s the last thing we need at this moment. As I said, voters have already begun casting their votes in the millions. And in just a few weeks, we’re going to know who the voters of this nation have chosen as the next president. The United States Constitution was designed to give voters one chance, one chance to have their voice heard in who serves on the court. And by the way, there’s no court session between now and the end of this election. That moment is now for the voters to get a chance to be heard, and their voice should be heard. And I believe voters are going to make it clear. They’ll not stand for this abuse of power, this constitutional abuse. There’s no discussion about what happens if the Senate confirms on the eve of election or in a lame duck after Donald Trump loses. A successor to Justice Ginsburg, what happens? But that discussion assumes that we lose this effort to prevent the grave wrong that Trump and McConnell are pursuing here. I’m not going to assume failure at this point. I believe the voices of the American people should be heard and will be heard. This vote, this fight, this nomination will not be over until the Senate votes, if it does vote. Winning that vote, if it happens, is everything. Action and reaction, anger and more anger, sorrow and frustration at the way things are in this country now politically, that’s the cycle that Republican senators will continue to perpetuate if they go down this dangerous path that they put us on. We need to deescalate, not escalate. That’s why I appeal to those few Senate Republicans, the handful who really will decide what happens. Please, follow your conscience. Don’t vote to confirm anyone nominated under the circumstances President Trump and Senator McConnell have created. Don’t go there. Uphold your constitutional duty, your conscience. Let the people speak. Cool the flames that have been engulfing our country. We can’t keep rewriting history, scrambling norms, ignoring our cherished system of checks and balances. That includes this whole business of releasing a list of potential nominees that I would put forward. They’re now saying, after Ruth Bader Ginsburg passed away, they said, “Biden should release his list.” It’s no wonder the Trump campaign asked that I release the list only after she passed away. It’s a game for them. It’s a play to [inaudible 00:19:44] up emotions and anger. There’s a reason why no presidential candidate, other than Donald Trump, has ever done such a thing. First, putting a judge’s name on a list like that could influence that person’s decision making as a judge, and that would be wrong, or at least create the perception that it would have influence. Second, anyone put on a list like that under these circumstances will be subject to unrelenting political attacks. Because any nominee I would select would not get a hearing until 2021 at the earliest, she would endure those attacks for months on end, without being able to defend herself. Thirdly, and finally, perhaps most importantly, if I win, I’ll make my choice for the Supreme Court not based on a partisan election campaign, but on what prior presidents have done, Republican and Democrats, and I’ve served with many of them. Only after consulting Democrats and Republicans in the United States Senate and seeking their advice and asking for the consent, it says, “Advice and consent of the Senate,” the president is the person who gets to name someone, propose. The Senate deposes. As everyone knows, I made it clear that my first choice for the Supreme Court will make history as the first African American woman justice. But I’ll consult with senators in both parties about that pick, as well as the legal and civil leaders in our country. In the end, the choice will be mine and mine alone, but I will consult. It will be the product of a process that restores our finest traditions, not the extension of one that’s torn this country apart the last years. So let me conclude with this. As I’ve said in this campaign, we’re in the battle for the soul of this country. We face historic crises, once in a generation pandemic, a devastating economic recession, the rise of white supremacy that the FBI directors warned us against, unseen since the sixties, and a reckoning on race that’s long overdue, a challenging climate, a changing climate that is ravaging our nation and the world as we speak. Supreme Court decisions will touch every part of these crises, every part of our lives and our future. The last thing we need is to add a constitutional crisis that plunges us deeper into the abyss, deeper into the darkness. If we go down this path, I predict it will cause irreversible damage. The infection this president has unleashed on our democracy can be fatal. Enough. Enough. Enough. We must come together as a nation. Democrats, Republicans, independents, liberals, conservatives, everybody. I’m not saying we have to agree on everything, but we have to reason our way through what ails us as citizens, voters, public service. That’s the guidebook called the Constitution. We have to act in good faith, in mutual goodwill, in the spirit of conciliation, not confrontation. This nation will continue to be inspired by Ruth Bader Ginsburg, but we should not only be inspired by her, we should be guided by her, by her willingness to listen to those with whom she disagreed, to respect other points of view. Famously, Justice Ginsburg got along well with some of the most conservative justices on the court. And she did it without compromising her principles, clouding her moral clarity, or losing her core principles. If she can do this, so can we. How we talk to one another matters, how we treat one another matters, respecting others matters. Justice Ginsburg proved it’s important to have a spine of steel, but also important to have an open hand, not a clenched fist, to those with whom we disagree. This nation needs to come together. I’ve said it many times in this election. We are the United States of America. There’s nothing we cannot overcome. There’s nothing we cannot do, if we do it together. Donald Trump seems to want to divide this nation between red states and blue states, between representing those states that vote for him and ignoring those who don’t. I do not. I cannot, I will not be that president. I’ll be a president for the whole country, for those who vote for me and those who vote against me. We need to rise in this moment for the sake of the country we love so dearly, indeed for its very soul. May God bless the United States of America. May God protect our troops. And may God bless Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Thank you so much."
"108","09-21-20"," Thank you very, very much. And is the [inaudible 00:00:05] family here? Anyone from… as they say in part of my city, your family done good. Long, long time. Isn’t it? God love you. Well, thank you. Thank you for taking the time to be here. I really do appreciate it. Today, unfortunately, America is going to, have to speak to this quickly, going to reach a tragic milestone. 200,000 deaths recorded as of today because of the coronavirus. 200,000 deaths all across this nation. And it means there are empty chairs and dining room tables and kitchen tables that weeks and months ago were filled with a loved one, a mom, a dad, a brother, a sister. And in many cases, the pain was made a lot worse because… and I’ve had people tell me this and close friends of the family tell me, because they were unable to visit their elderly parent or grandparent in a nursing home just before they passed away. Don’t know how many stories I’ve heard about from the nurses saying they held up a cell phone to the patient on a ventilator in the bed about to pass, Mr. Mayor, and that’s all they could speak to. And so the fact that people weren’t able to hold funeral services where family and friends could pray together, remember the loved ones they lost and place them as they place them in the hands of God. And so many of the rituals we have come to help us cope with pain and loss, to help us honor the lives of those we’ve loved, to help us come to closure, just aren’t available in the middle of this pandemic. What worries me now is we’ve been living with this pandemic for so long, we’re risking becoming numb to the toll it has taken on us and our country and communities like this. We can’t let that happen. We can’t lose the ability to feel the sorrow and the loss and the anger for so many lives lost. We can’t let the numbers become statistics, a background noise, just a blur that we see on the nightly news. 200 moms, dads, sons, daughters, grandparents, uncles, aunts, friends, coworkers, who are no longer with us. And so many of them didn’t have to lose their lives to this virus, quite frankly, if only the president has acted sooner. Back in May, Columbia University released a study that said that if the president of that acted just one week sooner, we would have saved 36,000 lives. Today, the leading model being used to track the virus, one which the White House and many the others rely on, that model says between now and the end of this year, while we’re waiting for a vaccine, between now and the end of the year, we’re going to lose up to 200,000 additional lives. It ranged from 178,000 to 200,000. And it points out as well that if we act by doing what you’re doing here in Wisconsin, wearing masks and making minimum requirements to meet this, we could save over 115,000 of those lives. So I hope to God we’ll not learn the same lesson, we might have to learn the same bad lesson we learned in the first nine months. Due to Donald Trump’s lies and incompetence in the past six months have seen one of the greatest losses of American life in history, in history. But sadly, it’s not over. As awful as the past 180 days have been, the next 90 days could be twice as bad. Just pause and think about it. We could be looking at, as I said, between 178 and 200,000 lives lost. And all the president does is deliberately change the subject, which is especially infuriating. Once again, we’re being told that we can save lives. This time as many, as I said, 110,000 lives if we just take the simple steps. Chief among them wearing masks and still the president refuses. In fact, we just watched him hold an indoor rally with thousands of people, many of whom weren’t wearing masks despite the clear evidence that we’re putting everyone of those people’s lives at risk. The president knew of these dangers back in February and he hid it from the American people. You can actually hear his own voice recorded by Bob Woodward’s interview with him saying that he understood how bad it was. We hear him privately saying, “This is a deadly virus. Far more deadly than any flu.” But that’s not what he was saying to us publicly. Publicly he told us that it was just like the flu and it would disappear in the warm weather like a miracle. It was all a lie. He knew it. What’s his explanation? He said he didn’t want to see the American people panic. He didn’t want to panic them. Trump panicked. The virus was too big for him. All his life, Donald Trump has been bailed out of any problem he faced. And with this crisis, a real crisis, the crisis that required serious presidential leadership, he just wasn’t up to it. He froze. He failed to act. He panicked and America has paid the worst price of nation in the world. Still, I support and understand what Donald Trump was saying. And by the way, the American people don’t panic. We don’t panic. I understand what he was saying because it crystallizes his whole worldview. When Donald Trump said he didn’t want to create a panic, he wasn’t just talking about a health panic, he was focused on the stock market. Trump was worried that if he told the public the truth, there would be a panic on the financial markets and that would hurt his chances of being reelected. That’s how Donald Trump views the world. He sees the world from Park Avenue. I see it from where I grew up in a town like this from Scranton, Pennsylvania. Hard scrapple, hard working town, just like this and so many more across Wisconsin. When you look at the world from Park Avenue, basically all you can see is Wall Street. And you think Wall Street built this country? Well, let me tell you. You think that Donald Trump as Donald Trump does, that handing out a $1.5 trillion tax giveaway primarily for large corporations and wealthy qualifiers is an economic plan? You think like Trump, that $15 an hour is too much for America’s essential workers. You eliminate overtime pay for millions of American workers. You try to take away healthcare from 20 million Americans in the middle of this pandemic. He’s in court today, trying to get that done. You trying to take away protections for preexisting conditions for 130 million Americans. You propose a plan that in order to make it look good, you’re going to get a little bump in your pay because you’re not going to take out withholding for your social security. But guess what? The actuary at social security says if he does that social security will be bankrupt by the middle of 2023. You might get that out of your paycheck, a little more in your paycheck, but guess what? Go home and tell your mom and dad, say goodbye to social security they worked for their whole lives. You think being tough with China is a trade deal that opens the door to big banks to make money in China. That’s basically all we got out of it. A lot of dairy farmers and farmers and manufacturing went under. But guess what? It started a trade war that [inaudible 00:08:38] farm banker fees and America throws the American manufacturing into a recession. But you know what happened? I didn’t know this at first. I couldn’t understand why he was so excited about it. America’s bank, Citibank, they got to open up in Beijing. They weren’t able to before. He scuttled a deal to lower prescription drug prices. He probably had a deal, but he wanted the pharmaceutical companies before they lowered the prices to do something that they thought was unethical. He asked them to send out $100 checks with his name on it to the elderly saying that, that’s the down payment. They said, “We’re not going to do that.” They weren’t going to do it so the deal fell apart. And now some 30 million Americans are on unemployment. You think the way to get American economy back on track is to give another gigantic multimillion dollar tax cut to the very wealthy. And here’s what they’re doing. The tax rate all of you pay in here is going to be higher than billionaires who make their money on investments. This is not exaggeration. He wants to lower, again, costing $30 billion to the Treasury, lower the capital gains tax to 15%. So while someone who makes their money is off the market is paying the 15% rate, you’re paying at a 24, 26, 28, depending on your tax bracket rate. It’s not right. Workers here pay close to twice that amount. Close to 30%. Trump’s tax cut for the wealthy is going to cost billions of dollars a year and who’s hide does it come out? It comes out of your hide. The simple truth is that Donald Trump ran for office saying he would represent the forgotten man and women in this country. And then once he got in office, he forgot us. Not only did he forget them, the truth is that he never really respected us very much. Oh, he loves his rallies but the next time he holds one look closely. Trump keeps his distance from anyone in the rally. The folks who come are packed in tight as they can be risking disease, mostly without mask, but not Trump. He safely he keeps his distance. They showed a couple of days ago, a reporter trying to come up or someone come through, he said, “No, no. You got to keep your distance. I don’t get close to these people.” He’s willing to let everybody else in the crowd risk their life, but not him. And now we know what he really thinks of the people who come to his rallies from someone who saw it up close and wrote about it up close in the White House. The former employee said he calls his own supporters, “Disgusting.” He said one of the benefits of this pandemic, cause he doesn’t have to shake their hands. He doesn’t have to shake their hand. That’s a good thing about the pandemic. For Trump these rallies are about entertainment, adoration and not respect. But you don’t kid yourself, this is a one way street. And all the things that Trump has said and done, nothing is more offensive than the way he’s spoken about many of you and the brave women and men who served the nation in uniform. Those have given their lives in service to this nation. It’s been confirmed by every outlet that he referred to them as losers and suckers. That’s what Trump calls those who served and They’re made the ultimate sacrifice. Let me tell you something, my son Beau served and volunteered to go to Iraq for a year. Won the Bronze Star, came home decorated, came home with stage 4 glioblastoma and died of cancer. He wasn’t a loser. He wasn’t a sucker. He was a patriot. And all those people with whom he served, volunteered, were patriots as well. Just like your sons and daughters and many of you, your moms and dads. Frankly, I’ve dealt with guys like Trump my whole life. Some neighbor where I come who would look down on us because we didn’t have a lot of money or your parents didn’t go to college. Guys who think they’re better than you. Guys who inherit everything they’ve ever gotten in their life and squander it. Guys who stretch and squeeze and stiff electricians and plumbers and contractors working on their hotels and casinos and golf courses just to put a few more bucks in their pocket. Guys who do everything they can to avoid paying their taxes they owe because they figure the rest of us, the little people, we can pick up the tab for the country. They’ve only seen four Trump tax returns in the last 45 years. And I don’t think there’s been any ever since he’s been running for president. He had to turn some of them over to start a casino in New Jersey. He had to show his taxes. And they showed that he paid zero. He talked about the billion dollars that… he paid zero, nothing. That’s a fact. And when he was asked about it, you know what he said? This why I really don’t like guys like this in my neighborhood. He said, “It makes me smart.” Or in another way, “I’m not a sucker. Why should I pay when I can figure my way out?” Zero. Wall Street’s a long way from Scranton, Pennsylvania, and here, but you get to see the world a little more clearly there. I grew up understanding as I believe all of you did that Wall Street didn’t build this country, hardworking people, given half a chance, the middle class built this country and unions built the middle class. Unions. Union labor like the folks in this room. I’ve learned a few simple lessons from my parents that I’ve never forgotten. One is from my mother. She used to say, and this the God’s truth, “Joey, remember nobody’s better than you, but everyone’s your equal. Nobody’s better, but everyone’s your equal.” It’s pretty simple. We’re all equal the way I was raised and we should be treated that way. I have to admit, I got my back up a little bit recently about something I saw and was on national television about the race. Some of the national… I don’t think they meant anything by it, but I don’t think they know how insulting it is. It was, Joe Biden, if elected, will be only the first president who didn’t go to an Ivy League school in a long time. Somehow that meant I didn’t belong. How could a guy who went to a state school be president? My reaction was the same it has been my whole life and I have to admit it and I’m not proud of it, but you close the door on me because you think I’m not good enough, guess what? Like all you guys, I’m going to bust down that door. My guess is a lot of you feel the same way about a lot of slights you’ve had because of our standing, quote, unquote. I say it’s about time that a state school president sat in the Oval Office because you know what? If I’m sitting there, you’re going to be sitting there too. Another lesson I learned from my dad and my family heard this all the time. My dad lost a job when coal died up in Scranton. We had to move. He had to go to my grandpa, his father-in-law and say, “Can Gen…” My mom. “Can Gen and the kids stay with you about a year? I’ll make it up to you. I got to move to Delaware where there’s a job. I’m going to come home every weekend. Talk about pride. Well, he used to say, “Joey, remember a job’s about a lot more than your paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in the community. It’s about being able to look your kids in the eye and say, honey, it’s going to be all right.” The dignity of work, what you do matters. You matter. That’s why I want to change the tax code. Instead of rewarding just wealth, and I don’t want to punish anybody, but instead of just rewarding wealth in this country, it’s about time we start to reward work. Under my plan nobody making less than 400,000 bucks and I don’t make it and you don’t make it. I don’t think. In this country will see their taxes go up. But if you make more than 400,000 bucks, you’re going to start to pay more. I’m not looking to punish anyone. I just think it’s about time the wealthiest and the biggest corporations, most profitable companies began to pay their fair share. You got all 90 of them paying zero. Making billions of dollars. They pay no tax at all. Zero. How can that be fair? The president talks all the time about how great the economy is. Well, I don’t know what y’all think, but where I come from and a lot of places in this state, it’s not so great. In the middle of this pandemic, now, the billionaires in this country have seen their wealth increase by $800 billion. Let me explain that again. All the billionaires in America during the pandemic, their net worth combined according to studies have increased by $800 billion. And the rest of us, well, 30 million people are unemployed. 20 million Americans are at risk of losing their home because they can’t find the rent payment. Seven plus million Americans are working part time who want to work full time. Evictions are on the rise. And for a lot of families, the kids are at home, not in school. I believe it’s the working people of this country that need a tax break. And under my plan, they’re going to get one. Whether you’re buying your first home, paying for health care premium or childcare or caring for an aging parent, you’re going to be able to afford it. I’ve said it many times, during this pandemic, we need to do more than just praise our essential workers, we need to pay them. We need to make healthcare affordable for every American. My plan will lower prescription drug costs by 60%. I’m going to make sure we keep protections for preexisting conditions that Obama and I put in place and make it a lot more affordable to have that healthcare. We need to empower labor unions in this country. Fair Labor Standards Act didn’t say back in the ’30s, you can’t have labor unions. It said we should promote labor unions. That’s what it said. And I will. And one more thing. Under my Build Back Better plan, we’re not only going to build infrastructure we need in this country with union workers and prevailing wage, we’re going to do something else. We’re going to rebuild manufacturing in this country and we’ll do it by enforcing a real buy American plan. Look, the federal government has spent $600 billion a year in purchasing power that the federal government has every year from tax dollars and determines how it’s used. When I’m president of United States, God willing, American companies with American workers, building American products using American supply chains are going to be the only ones who get the contracts. That means American aluminum for infrastructure, for developing more wind and solar and hydroelectric power, electric vehicles will replace cars in the federal fleet. We have one of the largest fleets in the world, the federal government. That means you’re going to be providing much more lighter frames, more aluminum for automobiles that already if they are aluminum built, they could reduce by 15%, even with a combustion engine. 1.5 million new affordable homes and housing. We’re going to build and this is going to require a lot of work and increased work at home. We’re going to make sure that we transfer 40 million buildings around America to make them weather resistant so that they are… you change the windows, the doors, the walls, the whole range. Building Back Better means firing up our shuttered foundries and forging ahead towards future that’s truly made in America. I want to spend just a few moments talking about those who voted for Donald Trump last time. When I went was out here in the [inaudible 00:22:06] administration, you voted for us and then an awful lot of people in this county changed and they voted for Trump last time. I know many of you were frustrated. You were angry. You believed you weren’t being seen, represented or heard. I get it. It has to change. And I promise you this, it will change with me. You will be seen, heard and respected by me. This campaign isn’t about just winning votes, it’s about restoring the basic dignity in this country that every worker deserves. Basic dignity that we all have without winning back the hearts and yes, the soul of America, we’re not going to make it. Just a few days ago when I was asked about the death count approaching 200,000, the president said, and I quote, he said, I won’t quote him. The president said, “If you take out the blue states run by Democratic governors and just look at the red states, Republican governors are doing quite well. Now, of course, it’s a simple, factual matter, it’s just not true. If you just count all the deaths in the red states, we are number two in the world in death just behind Brazil. But more fundamentally, reflects on the part of Donald Trump that he has a deeply flawed and divisive view of the United States, this nation and the job he holds. Think about what he’s saying. He’s saying, if you live in a state like Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, states with Democratic governors, you’re not his problem. He has no obligation to you. He’s not responsible for you as president, your family or your wellbeing. I don’t see the presidency that way. I don’t pledge allegiance to red states of America or blue states of America, I pledge allegiance to the United States of America. One nation, indivisible under God. For real. I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I’m not going to govern as a Democratic president, I’m going to govern as president. I get criticized for saying that sometimes with some in my party, but that’s not what I’m going to do. I’m going to fight as hard for those who supported me as those who did not support me. This is not a partisan moment for God’s sake. This has to be an American moment. In the next few weeks, we have a chance to put anger and division and the darkness that overtaken this country behind us. We’ve got to put it behind us. I know I’ve been criticized since I entered the primaries about, I say, I want to unite the country. We have to unite the country. This is not who we are and we can. We’ve done it so many times in our history. We’ve begun to a new. If we get control of this virus, we can. We can reward work. We can fix the healthcare system. We can be a safe and just nation. We can deal with the existential threat of climate change which aluminum is going to be a gigantic part of. We can be what we are at our best, one nation. One nation, one people, one America. You just have to remember who in God’s name we are. This is the United States of America. In our long history, there’s been nothing we’ve been unable to do, nothing we’ve been able to overcome when we’ve done it together. And I’m confident going all over this nation, we can do it together. The American people are hungry. We have to bring the nation together. That’s going to be my primary job. Ans I want to thank you all. God bless you for what you’re doing. May you all stay safe and may God protect our troops. Thank you so much, Mr. Mayor. Thank you. And thank you ma’am. Appreciate it."
"109","09-23-20"," Good afternoon. Or good morning. It’s still good morning, I believe. I want to say thank you for coming out on this fabulous Charlotte fall day to have a very important conversation with a very important person that we will hope to see in January, on a stage, being inaugurated as the next president of the United States. I think that’s why we’re here. But before I talk about the seriousness of this conversation, what I’d like to do is make sure that everyone recognizes where we are. We are in Camp North End, but more importantly, we’re in a place where creativity flourishes. The artists that have worked on the art that you’re going to see today, we have to recognize them. They’re people that give so much, and they don’t get paid enough. And that’s the kind of thing that we’re beginning to see. In a pandemic, we ought to be rewarding people that are doing the work that makes us better people, and that’s what artists do. So I want to recognize Dammit Wesley. Is Dammit around? Okay. Gianna [Gianna McCantz 00:02:37]. Where’s Gianna? Gianna? Carla Aaron-Lopez, [Garrison Gis 00:02:46], Marcus Kaiser, [McKayla Benter 00:02:51], Frank [Zambi 00:02:53], and John Harrison. They have done the mural that says, “Camp North in Charlotte, North Carolina: Build Back Better.” And we all know whose plan that is. So thank you very much for being here this morning. I am going to say that I would like to introduce someone that you’re all familiar with, someone that you probably don’t know that is a big professional bowling fan, that likes Minor League Baseball, but I’ll let you figure out what you really know him for. So thank you, let’s welcome our next guest. Mayor Lyles, thank you so much. Vice President Biden, welcome to Charlotte, North Carolina. It feels so good to be home. You guys know I was in a bubble for a while recently. Man, this is important. This is extremely important, and that’s why I’m glad to be a part of this conversation. Being born and raised in North Carolina, this is home for me. Always will be home for me. And so to be a part of this conversation and to just have real conversations, we had a conversation in the back and I just thought about how grateful and privileged I am to be a part of these tough, difficult conversations, especially during this time. Being a parent, have an 11 year old son, a eight year old daughter, these times are very crucial and very important. I can’t explain enough how much it means to talk about the things that have to be discussed. And you guys being here, everything is about respect. Everything is about respect. So teaching my kids about respecting the office, having these conversations, and that’s why this election is important. A lot of times people say, “My vote doesn’t count.” I come from humble beginnings where a lot of people where you live and stuff say, “It doesn’t matter. As Black people, it doesn’t matter. You know, if I vote, what’s going to really change? We still got the same restaurants on the corners. We don’t have the benefits of having places to eat. So the only way that we can really enforce our power is by voting. Voting. So this conversation is unbelievably important. So glad you guys are here so that we can ask some real questions. So without further ado, I would like to introduce the next president of the United States, Joe Biden. Hello, hello, hello, hello. My name is Joe Biden. I’m trying to get a job with Chris. He is Mr. President. He’s president of the union. Mr. President, I was kidding him. You know, the hardest thing, only thing harder than being president of a union is being the mayor of a beautiful city. Folks, thanks for taking the time to be here today. I really appreciate it. And we even have an astronaut in our house and I tell you what, that’s pretty cool. Look, first of all, I want to thank Chris and the mayor for being here, and all of you for being here. You know, these are tough times. Over 200,000 Americans have passed away. Over 200,000, and the number is still rising. The impact on communities is bad across the board, but particularly bad for African-American communities. Almost four times as likely, three times as likely to catch the disease, COVID, and when it’s caught, twice as likely to die as white Americans. It’s sort of emblematic of the inequality that exists and the circumstances that exist. One of the things that really matters to me, is we could do … It didn’t have to be this bad. You have 30 million people on unemployment, you have 20 million people figuring whether or not they can pay their mortgage payment this month, and what they’re going to be able to do or not do as the consequence of that, and you’ve got millions of people who are worried that they’re going to be thrown out in the street because they can’t pay their rent. Although they’ve been given a reprieve for three months, but they have to pay double the next three months when it comes around. How people going to do that? And the way, in fact, the Democratic House and the Senate passed, stepped up and passed a significant amount of money to help people get through the process, including keeping businesses open and the like. Well, guess what? They insisted there being a thing called an inspector general, somebody watching where every dollar went. The first thing the president of the United States did is fire that inspector general. There is no inspector. He’s fired. Fired. And so you got 40% of, only 40% of the money intended for small businesses going to small businesses. Only 40% of it. 60% has gone to the Mar-a-Lago crowd. In addition to that, we find ourselves in a circumstance where the idea that we’re going to continue to provide for unemployment insurance for people is very much in doubt, although the House just passed a package today. My generic point is, that the University of Columbia pointed out, that if in fact the president had acted, even though we know now he knew exactly how bad the pandemic was back in February, he’s on tape with Bob Woodward saying he knew how bad it was, and he didn’t say a thing. He didn’t say a thing. If he had spoken, as I said, they said at Columbia, one week earlier, 37,000 more people be alive today. We’re going to have another influx of cases, just between now and January, it’s expected that we’re going to have somewhere between, depending on which estimate you take, between 138 and 178,000 more deaths. And if people just do what we’re doing here, and when you’re at a social distance, as I am, you can take a mask off, but wear a mask. They estimate that would save about close to 89, 90,000 people. And so it’s about being responsible. It’s about being responsible. And we’re not being very responsible. But what I want to talk to you about today is that we have to break a cycle. The cycle that exist is that the African-American community by and large finds itself at the bottom of the economic heap, businesses and others, when things are good. When things get bad, they’re the first ones in the hole. And when things get better, they’re the last ones out. In addition to that, we have a criminal justice system that needs significant repair. And we’re just only beginning, slightly, to make some progress now. And thirdly, if you’re a business person, let me put it this way. Every person out there wants an opportunity to make it for their family. My dad used to have an expression, “Everybody’s entitled to be treated with dignity.” And then he said, “Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in the community. It’s about being able to hold your head up. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, ‘Honey, everything’s going to be okay. For too many people, particularly in the African-American community, they can’t say that. That’s not able to be done. So one of the things that I want to talk with you about today, is how do we build wealth? Because ultimately, ultimately the African-American community only is going to have its place equal to everyone else when they’re in a position to be able to build wealth, be able to build wealth. And that goes for everything from access to being able to purchase a home, access to jobs, access to just being able to have an even shot. And that’s what I hope we’re going to talk a little about today. It goes to education, as well as access to education, access beyond. Everything from a lot of poor whites and African-Americans, poor African-Americans and Hispanic live in Title I districts, meaning that they live in school districts that have very low tax base. And right now we spent $15 billion a year to compensate for that low tax base. I increased that to $45 billion. What it does, it keeps teachers in schools because we’re short teachers significantly. 125,000 teachers short right now. Be over half a million by 2023. In addition to that, we find ourselves in a circumstance where we used to have in our schools, in the old days, used to have one … Right now we don’t have any, we virtually have no school psychologists in our schools. And so teachers come in to school and they’re expected to solve every problem. Well, there’s one school psychologist for every 1,507 kids in school. It should be closer to one to 500. We can do that by increasing the money I just talked about from 15 to 45. And send every single child that’s three years old, four years old, and five years old, not to daycare, but to school. All the studies of the great universities in this state and every other have pointed out in the last eight years, that’ll increase by 58% their chances of going all the way through school, no matter what the ZIP code they come from, no matter where they are, and be able to do it without getting themselves in trouble. And then we’re going to talk about, I think a big issue here is access to apprenticeships and access to community colleges and college, and the student debt requirements that are there. Hope we can talk about that. Hope we can talk about that, but I want to talk about basically one big important thing. How do we change the dynamic? This is a gigantic opportunity. As bad as things have gotten, the blinders have sort of been taken off the American people now. They look out there, and we have the pandemic, unemployment. We have race relations that are just been drawn into focus and everything from police brutality to lack of access. But the American people have all of a sudden, average people have gone, “My Lord. Holy mackerel. I didn’t know it was this bad.” A lot of them didn’t know. A lot did. But a lot didn’t know it was this bad. And talking to … Well, I won’t go into it. I’m talking too much now in my opening statement, but here’s the point. The point is, I believe we have a gigantic opportunity, a gigantic opportunity to fundamentally change the systemic racism and the systemic problems that exist in our system. And I think we have to do it, but only one way to do it. We’ve got to show up and vote. But I believe the American people are not going to be turned off. I believe no matter what the administration does to try to make it hard to vote for everyone, not just people of color, but everyone, no matter what, I think they’re going to vote. You see what’s happened in Virginia, early voting. They have four hour lines in the first day, and we’re over 40 days out. People are going to show up and vote. They will not be dissuaded. And so that’s why I’m optimistic. I was asked by one of the foreign leaders when I was overseas, when I was the vice president, they said, “Can you define America for me?” I said, “Yes, I can, in one word. Possibilities. Possibilities.” We’re the only country that believes anything’s possible. But it’s about time we make it possible for everybody? That’s what this is all about. I think we got a gigantic opportunity in the year 2020 to make these changes. And with that, as my mother would say, I’m going to hush up and take any questions you all have. And I’ve got to get out of the way here. The first question we’re going to ask, our hometown star, [inaudible 00:02:03]. Far from a star, but appreciate it. My first question, you sort of spoke about education. And for me, I’m the only person in my family to go to an HBCU. And you, right down the street from Johnson C. Smith, North Carolina is known for having a lot of HBCUs. I was kidding Chris inside. I was saying as long as I can say what the best HBCU is in America, Delaware State University. But that’s another issue. That’s a joke, but it’s not a joke. They’re great. That’s how I got my start, by the way. I went to University of Delaware. But the reason I got involved in politics in the first place is because of what was going on in my state in terms of segregation and in terms of Dr. King being assassinated. Part of the, major part of our city was burned to the ground. That’s how I got engaged. And a lot of my support came out of that HBCU. Look, right now, one thing all the data shows is that, given an opportunity, an equal opportunity, there’s not a single thing that an African-American can’t do that a white American can do, that a Hispanic American, an Asian American … I mean, not a single thing. And so what’s happened? It’s about access to opportunity and access to good jobs. Now, an awful lot of universities like, great university like UNC or Wake Forest, a lot of schools, they have endowments, and the endowment allows them to provide for the circumstance to bid for these major federal initiatives that allow them to bring into the school a technology or a program that is able to bring in outside sponsors, as well as government sponsors, and then have students work in those areas. For example, cybersecurity. Cybersecurity is a big deal, but you have to … And as a future, there’s going to be millions of, over time, good paying jobs in the area of cybersecurity. But because the HBCUs, for example, most of them don’t have the economic … They don’t have the endowment to be able to build the facilities that can attract the environment, the government funding, as well as private endowment. They don’t get to set these up. For example, when I was vice president, we went down to Roanoke and we provided funding for an HBCU to have a cybersecurity proposal. They did it. They got the contract. And now what they’re doing are training young women and men who’ll get out and good starting jobs, jobs where you can end up being paid more than a hundred grand a year. And they’re fully, totally, thoroughly capable. What I’ve done is I’ve proposed, and we’ll get this done … I proposed a 10-year program for $70 billion for HBCUs, $70 billion. And that $70 billion will be available through the HBCUs based on their competition to get access to it, but everyone will qualify, every HBCU. And they’ll be able to do the kinds of things that other universities do. For example, Delaware State University is a great university. The president of the university is a young man who used to work for me in my Senate office. Now, brilliant guy. He’s a doctorate. The end result of it is though when the University of Delaware makes an application for dealing with solar energy, because it has a significant base, it gets this significant injection of technological capability, or, for example, light metals. They took over an old facility, it used to be a Ford facility long, long time ago. They took over a facility used to be a Chrysler facility and got shut down. And now what do they have at that facility? They have people in that facility who are now doing metallurgy that relate to making lightweight aluminum and metal decks for aircraft carriers. Well, it’s a multi-million dollar and will end up being a billion-dollar project. And so the people who get to work on that, the very students in that university get to work on it, they’re the ones that are going to go out and get these great jobs. So that’s the first thing I’m going to do for HBCUs. Secondly, we have to look at, and we have been looking at, the idea that we have to bring in HBCUs to engage in more of what we are doing in terms of our national dialogue. And for example, I kid … Two of the guys that are on my co-sponsors of my campaign, African-Americans, they’ve talked about themselves as Morgan men. I’m a Morgan man. Well, there’s a lot of great universities including right here, but we have an opportunity to provide for, you’re able to get to those universities. How can you do it? Well, I’m going to see to it that any family, anyone who comes from a family that makes a total income of less than $125,000 a year gets free college education. They don’t get in. If they get in and qualify, they pay nothing to go to college. Secondly, there are also programs that exist now that if you provide for the work, that you will volunteer to do something in the public interest, and you do it for five years or more, you can deduct $10, 000 a year up to $50,000 off of that debt you have. And you have an awful lot of young African-Americans that have graduated. The average debt is about $19,000 a year. Well, it’s hard as hell to get started. Hard to get started when you have that debt hanging over your head. The average debt is even higher. It’s up to $28,000 a year, someone graduating from a four year school. And that’s why the economists had predicted prior to, and I’ll end with this, I’m telling you too much, but because I’m pretty passionate about this. What happens is that if, it was pointed out before the COVID crisis, that we’re going to have an economic slowdown because the entire generation, this from 9/11 generation through to the generation now, and coming out of this, this god-awful circumstance we’re in, they, in fact, are not going to have the wherewithal because of student debt to be able to borrow the money to buy a home, buy a new vehicle, buy an apartment, and spend the money and capital, where a significant portion of our economy is driven by consumption, by consumption. And this generation, this whole new generation from 9/11 on, that in fact is, they’re not in a position to be able to do it. So there’s a whole lot of reasons that economically this will benefit. This isn’t just draining money. And by the way, I pay for every one of these things by the way, I deal with the tax structure. But that’s another story. So that’s a piece of what I think we can and should be doing with HBCUs. And secondly, I will, in my administration, elevate, elevate the standing of HBCUs by the people in my administration as well. Thank you, Mr. Vice President. The vice president would like to hear from you, so I’d like to recognize someone that might have a question for this forum. Yes. Hi. There’s a microphone right there. There’s a microphone right there, and there’s one on this side as well. Hi, I’m Hannah Bonaparte. We’re going to raise it to $15 an hour nationally. I’ve been deeply involved in raising it as I’ve gone around the country working with cities and counties that in fact have raised it, including New York City and out on the West Coast, as well. Here’s the deal. If you make less than $15 an hour working 40 hours a week, you’re making a wage under the poverty level. No one in America should be working for a 40-hour week job and still be living in poverty. It should not exist. Number one. Number two, it also demonstrates that if we pay people $15 an hour as a minimum wage, you grow the economy. The idea that this somehow puts people out of business, there’s no evidence of that. What happens is you have people, if you’re making 15 bucks an hour instead of $7 an hour, you’re able to buy more things. You’re able to pay more bills. You’re able to do more that ends up increasing the GDP, the growth of the whole economy. So it’s not only a good thing for the person who is going to be making a decent wage from the beginning, but going to be good for the economy as a whole. Next question. Yes, please. Hi, I’m Andrea Brown. I’m a second grade teacher. Nice to meet you. My mother would say, “God love you, dear. It’s been difficult, but thank you. Well, as a simple proposition for me, I don’t exaggerate as a second grade teacher, why you’re so important. If I had only $1 to spend in education and I could spend it post-graduation or pre-kindergarten, I’d spend it pre-kindergarten. Not a joke. Because you know as well as I do based on your educational background, that 60% of a child’s brain is already developed by the time they’re three, four, five years old. Right. And so what happens is, people start off based on their ZIP code and their family background. They may start off way behind the curve. You know you have a lot of students who they come into school, if they come from a very poor background in a community raised by a single mom or a single dad, through no fault of their own, they will have probably heard 1 million fewer words spoken by the time they get to first grade. That by itself is an impediment. Nobody’s forced that on anybody, but we’ve got to change it. And so the way to change it is threefold. Number one, as I said, provide for early education, starting at three years of age, and it’s not … This is you think, “Oh my Lord, why we have a three-year-old go to school?” They learn as rapidly as a six-year-old, a 12-year-old, a 14-year-old. And they just suck it all up. They just suck it all up. Number one. Number two, to make sure that we pay teachers enough money to stay in the business of teaching. My wife’s a full-time teacher. My wife has never stopped. As first lady, as the second lady, I should say, she taught 15 credits every semester at a community college. At a community college. Before that, she taught juniors and seniors in high school for 25 years. I think it was 25. My point is a long time. Although, I’m not allowed to tell the exact number because my wife is 30 years younger than I am. I started off not quite that much. There’s no woman in the entire Biden family as old as any man, but that’s another issue. All kidding aside, the fact is that it is the lifeblood of… Look, people… They say, “Well, these two children.” They’re all our children. They are the kite strings that lift our national ambitions aloft. Right. It’s bizarre, crazy for us. In every single empirical study done, the more money you spend, the better you educate a child throughout the process, the better the community as a whole is. Right. Everybody, across the board. That’s why we also have to make sure that we provide for more direct funding for specific programs in schools. Right. Local funding. Right. It’s not national funding. It’s not federal funding. Federal funding can focus on particular needs within schools. One of those needs is to deal with access to equal education in the early grades and not be determined by your zip code. That requires us to spend more money on schools that in fact, and teachers… Look, I’m not going to ask you what you make. Teachers… One of the other things that all the studies have shown is that when you’re in a student body where there’s students of color, it makes a gigantic difference if there are teachers of color, particularly male teachers of color. Definitely. A gigantic difference. It’s just a factual predicate. We have to encourage schools of education to attract more people of color to get in and teach. The only way to do that is to raise the salaries. Right. Raise the salaries. Right. I mean, idea that a teacher is out there after several years making $40,000… You have, probably, a student debt larger than that. Enough, for real. That’s why the last piece of the student debt… Anybody who has a student debt who teaches, that counts as working for the national interest. You get to deduct $ 10,000 of that student debt per year for five years, and up to $50,000 if you’re teaching. That’s amazing. We can afford this, by the way. This is not something that we have… Just give you a little idea here. I carry this card with me because everybody says, “Well, Biden’s going to raise all taxes, and everybody’s going to be in trouble, and what we’re going to do here.” Let’s see if I can find it, if I have it here. Anyway, I have a list of how I will fund every single thing that I’m talking about. For example, if we just made corporations not pay 21%, and 91 of the Fortune 500 companies pay no tax, zero, zero, okay, none… If we just made them pay 28, it used to be 38, make 28%, raise it to 28%, and everybody had to pay it, that would raise a total of $ 1,370 billion. I’m not trying to punish anybody. It’s time for everybody to start paying their fair share. Right. President has a new proposal. Some of you may like it. I don’t know anybody in my neighborhood know it works very well, and that is another $30 billion tax cut for billionaires. You think I’m making it like billionaire. I sound like Bernie Sanders, “Billionaires are bad.” That’s not the problem. Problem is in reducing the capital gains tax… If you make your money off investments as opposed to sweating your brow or walking up and getting a paycheck, right, he thinks you should only have to pay 15% of your income. You’ll pay more as a school teacher than somebody making $20 million bucks. It’s all coming from investments. It’s not right. Don’t want to punish anybody. Just about time everybody pays their fair share. The way I do that is I raise the tax back for millionaires and billionaires to 39.4%. They’re talking about 90%. That’s not true. It was 39.4% when Bush was president. You just raise that tax rate back up to 39.4%. That raises 6%. That raises $90 billion. Just give you an example. There’s much more I could talk, but my point is it will not… By the way, I went to undergraduate and graduate school. I was very flattered that, I think it’s 14 Nobel Laureates in economics, just endorsed me, and said my plans make sense. All this stuff about Biden’s going to bankrupt the country and Biden is going to spend $400 billion, and you’re going to raise your taxes… not true. We can do it all by just somebody just starting to pay your fair share. That’s all. That’s all. Give people who need a break, a break. Thank you. Thank you. We have time for one more question. Well, I think we’re going to have time for two more questions, if that’s okay, Mr. Vice-president. Maybe three. I know I’m in trouble. Maybe three. I know I’m late, but I apologize. Having some difficulty. Sorry. Hello. Nice to meet you. My name is Subrina Collier. My husband and I, Chef Greg Collier, own restaurants here in Charlotte: one, Uptown Yolk, and one here in Camp North End, Leah and Louise. As you know, the restaurants have been hit severely hard the past… Would it be seven months now? A lot of us, which are small business owners and small minority business owners, didn’t receive as much relief, nationally. The city of Charlotte has been amazing with offering grants and things that we can float us over and still pay our employees, but we still had to cut staff. We still had to cut hours. What would be the relief for a small business owner, specifically restaurants? Is there a plan to give us some type of relief? I don’t know, a tax cut, anything. Yes. There was a big plan to do it. There’s a modal plan. First of all, the Cares Act, which passed out of the House and Senate, which was a total of $2 trillion overall, twice, was supposed to provide what they called the Main Street Lending Program. For four months, it didn’t lend a penny. None of the money went out, number one, because you got 20 Republicans in the Senate who said they don’t want to depend anything on anything, for real. The president who has, as I said, fired the Inspector General, so you don’t know where the money’s going for certain. Secondly, on the early program for small businesses… The small business is defined of fewer than 50 employees. Now, most small businesses that are neighborhood small businesses are 10 or fewer employees. What I propose is we focus on making sure that the money goes directly to those businesses that in fact provide for being able to keep their employees on the payroll for the 10 or fewer employees. That’s a priority, and then 50 and under. Here’s what’s happened. What’s happened is that not only has that not occurred, a lot of the money has gone to very big businesses that didn’t need the… I mean, they may need it, but they didn’t need it to stay alive. The commitment that I proposed, and we thought we had done, is that right now, if you get a government bailout, quote, unquote, “loan to stay alive,” what you cannot do is take that money and either buy back your own stock and, or increase your salaries with that money. It’s to keep people employed, keep them on a payroll. That’s what a lot of the businesses have done. They buy back their own stock, increasing the net worth of the people who own the stock, and in fact, pay their salaries based on stock then. They should not be allowed to do that, number one, with government money, bailing people out. Secondly, a lot of you don’t know the circumstance. Now there’s no national standards as to how to open. How do you open safely? President says, “Just put up a sign, Come on in.” Well, you know your employee. Beyond your employees, your customers are going to go, “I don’t know. I mean, does everybody have to have the mask? Do they have dividers in the restaurant? Tell me how the sanitary conditions are working.” Well, you need money to pay for all that stuff. That’s why we proposed to have a multi-billion dollar program where businesses are able to get the money, not borrow the money, get the money to be able to open in the middle of this pandemic, including fixing the testing fiasco. You should be in a situation where your employees can, in 24 hours, get a test to determine whether or not they’re positive or negative. You need to do that for your own protection, and the public likes to know that is protection that there are protection against anything that happens within your restaurant. The bottom line is the money is already there. The president is just not releasing it. Department is not releasing the money. It’s all done in order to be able to keep the economy moving. Right now, we have over 30 million people on unemployment, over 30 million in unemployment. How in God’s name are we going to generate economic growth unless we can figure out how to keep these people back and help you get back in business? It’s the same way with schools. How many schools are not opening because there are no national standards set? No national standards set. No, no. Okay. I’m really good at this. This drives me crazy. Right now, we’re in a situation where if you take a look, there is no national standard for how to open schools, how to open them safely, because the president says, “I have no responsibility. That’s not my response.” I mean, literally, that’s his phrase. “It’s not my responsibility. I’m not the blame for any of this. Let the governors or the mayors take care of it,” and then without the financial help that’s needed to be able to take care of it. I’ve laid out in detail back in July, what we’d have to do to open safely and includes providing the protective PPE, the mask, and other things that are needed, gloves, et cetera, for the schools, the school teachers, and for the children coming to school. Secondly, you have to reduce the number of students in one room. You have to have modules that are smaller. For that, you need more teachers, not fewer teachers. You got to pay more teachers. Number three, you’ve got to be able to sanitize the schools, whether it’s everything from the water fountain to the lavatory, or just the surfaces that are touched, and what is breathed on by people. That costs a lot of money to do that, like it would for a restaurant as well for you to have to do that. The money is there, available, to do that, but the president refuses. What he says is just open up and make sure that… School should just open up. It also relates to how far down you’ve got the reinfection rate. If it’s down below one, then it’s rational. You can, with those protections, go ahead and open a school, but watch it very closely. It requires testing and tracing to make sure you’re still on course there. Look, the other thing is that if you think about it, the FEMA, the Federal Emergency… They had agreed that they were going to provide masks for schools. They started to hand them out to schools. Well, guess what? The president didn’t like that, or somebody didn’t like that. The ruling was made, “Opening schools safely is not a national emergency,” so they stopped it. Refusing to even provide masks for schools because it’s not a national emergency. Well, if this isn’t a national emergency, I don’t know what the hell is. The way we’re doing this is the way… I’ll end with this. … way and I’ll end with this. The president was in Ohio, I guess a couple of days ago at a rally. I don’t want to misquote him. And he said at the rally and I wrote this down, he said that “We virtually turned the corner. Nobody is really dying.” He said, “Yeah, elderly people are dying and they’re dying because they have heart conditions or other, but quote unquote, “virtually, they’re virtually nobodies. They’re the only ones dying. So you go home and your mom is gone, your dad’s gone. He’s a virtual nobody? The idea, the way we’re talking about people, and this is all within our power to do something. The virus wasn’t his fault, but the way he’s handled it has been close to criminal. And so many people breaking their necks and by the way, my deceased wife, when I first got married, I married a beautiful woman from Syracuse, New York, Skaneateles, New York. And I got elected and I was 29-years-old. I come from a very modest family. Not bragging about it, but I was listed as the poorest man in Congress for 36 years. Because I didn’t think you were supposed to earn any money while you’re there other than your salary. And then when I got elected vice president, one of the press outlets said, “It’s probable no man has ever been assuming the office of vice president with fewer assets than Joe Biden.” I hope they weren’t talking intellectual assets. When I got elected when I was 29, I was in Washington before I was sworn in and I got a phone call from my fire department saying my wife and daughter have just been killed. And my two boys were not likely to make it. A tractor trailer broadsided them while they were Christmas shopping. And at the time, my wife’s father, my father-in-law, he came home from World War II and he had owned a restaurant. He was a cook in World War II in the Navy and he ended up opening up a restaurant in a place called Auburn, New York, a town about 20,000 people, just south of Syracuse. And it became the meeting place for everybody. It’s a place that doctors would start off the morning getting their coffee and the lawyers would have their lunch and kids after graduations would come to this called the Hunter Dinerant and then he opened up other restaurants. And in order to try to convince me to stay, I don’t blame him. I do the same with my daughter. Try to convince after he graduated to take a job in Upstate New York, rather than go back to Delaware. He offered me his prize diner. And he was making at that time, I would have made five times what I made as a lawyer. A starting lawyer salary is six grand and it was 30,000 bucks a year. But the problem was for three years, I had five years I watched how hard he worked. I don’t know how you do it. You got to love it. Even in good times they think you’re crazy. It’s 24 hours a day, but you deserve a break and your employees deserve a break. And the fact that you’re fighting so hard to keep them on a job is a testament to the kind of people you are. But I promise you, I guarantee you if I’m elected, you’ll get both the PPE. You’ll get also the money to be able to open and the additional money, not only to maintain your employees, but to maintain an open place that you in fact can. I’ve met with a lot of restaurateurs up and around the country so they can open up and do everything from having plastic shields in front of the cashiers, to a lot of things you can do to make it safe, make it safe, and you’ll get the help. Thank you so much. Thank you. I can really do yes or no if you ask me the easy questions. All right, so we have one more easy question. [inaudible 00:43:01] whatever you want to ask. An easy question. This is one of my colleagues he serves on the Charlotte City Council, Malcolm Graham with me. I used to be a city council when I ran for the Senate because it was too hard. They know where you live. Exactly. First, I want to thank you. Oh my Lord, I apologize. I didn’t know. I’m sorry. No, no, no, no, no. As you know, killed at the Emanuel AME Church shooting in Charleston. Well, first of all, and I guess I’ll just say it. This has been the most corrupt administration in modern American history. The Justice Department has turned into the president’s private law firm. He actually has them representing him on women who accused him of rape. Where does that come from? And the Justice Department under my administration will be totally independent of me. I will not direct them who to prosecute, how to prosecute, what to prosecute. And I will not be injecting. I will not enter their decisions based upon the judgments they make about what cases they bring and they don’t bring. With regard to the Civil Rights Division, I would significantly increase two things. One, civil rights presence in the Justice Department elevated so it has access to and transparency to all police departments’ activities across the country. Just so they are aware that it’s transparent what’s going on. I would also make sure that I elevate the Justice Department, excuse me, the Civil Rights Division to have a direct office with inside the White House. When, for example, I’m the guy that wrote the Violence Against Women Act. When the president asked me what I wanted as vice president, I said, “I want to have jurisdiction over that act inside the White House.” Because it elevates the standing of whatever that office that comes inside the White House. So I would make sure there’s a combination of the Civil Rights Division having more direct authority inside the Justice Department and being able to investigate than in fact it has now. But most of all, most of all, I would have an attorney general who understood his oath of office. It’s not a joke. The attorney general has the oath of office that in fact could do and move on what the professionals in the department thought had to be pursued without my interfering to say, “No, they’re my friends” or “I know them” or “Go after this person. Go after Hillary.” You know what I mean? This kind of stuff. I get asked the question all the time by the press that travels with me, although I’m not sure the same ones that are traveling today have asked it, but I get asked the following question. “If in fact you get elected, would you prosecute Trump? Would you pursue prosecuting Trump?” And the answer is I’m not going to pursue prosecuting anybody. I’m going to do what the Justice Department says should be done, should be done and not politicize it. It’s the most dangerous thing that’s happened so far is the politicization of the Department of Justice. It’s become the Department of Trump and that’s wrong. Thank you Mr. Vice president for the very, very heartfelt feelings, but more importantly for having policies that really follow who you are as a person. So on behalf of all of the people that are here today, thank you for giving us your time, but more importantly, giving us the changes that you see for our country. We really appreciate that. Who’s the fellow who runs 26 organizations for housing? Public? I know we didn’t get a chance to talk. Because I think what you’re doing is incredibly consequential. And I like to give you a paper on the way out of what I think we can and should do. It’s very detailed and I’d love your feedback. I’ll put a phone number on it, okay? Because it is a gigantic, gigantic, gigantic undertaking. And unless we can get people into housing, unless we can provide for housing, unless we can stop the gentrification where people are left out, then we’re going to be in real trouble. And what you’re doing is really … I’m not trying to boost him. I’ve never met the gentleman, but I did read your bio and what you’re working on. And I’d really like your input and may able to call you if I could after you get what I’m proposing in detail and see what we can work out. And part of the reason I do this and what I miss about being able to do larger engagements is this is where I learn. I’m a tactical guy. I mean, I’d rather be shaking your hand and looking you in the eye and you telling me what needs to be done. And don’t be reluctant at all to criticized my plan if you think it doesn’t make sense. I think it’s pretty good. I’ve worked on it really, really hard. It goes from Section 8 housing all the way to first-time home buyers, to the whole notion of these… Anyway, I’m going to give it to you before I leave, okay? You’re very polite to sit here all this time. Thank you. Thank you everybody. I really appreciate it. Thank you very much. Well, Mr. Vice President, I understand we’re going to have a group photo, so everybody has their mask on and I’m going to follow the instructions of the photographer on top of the ladder. So does everyone turn and Mr. Vice President, Chris. Don’t Jump."
"110","09-25-20"," I want you to know how deeply honored I am to endorse you. You have no idea what it means to me. To be a part of your campaign and be a part of doing what’s right for this country. I feel good about it. I’m not going to change my party, but I believe what I’m doing is the right thing. In this administration, there is no character, or integrity or values. That’s why you’re so important because you represent all of those things. Thank you. And more so. Indeed, what this country needs right now, completely. Empathy and compassion, a lot of times that’s the only thing we really need on a day that’s really bad. Your empathy and compassion for those less fortunate have meant the world to me, and I know to many people. Well, that’s who John was. That’s who John was with me. I had just lost my family when John and I met. Right. The way John embraced my boys, Hunter and Beau. I loved to watch the two of you go at it on the floor, and they go arm in arm off the floor. You didn’t always agree, and you were so good at that. That bipartisanship and the common ground was really what made the two of you very special. [crosstalk 00:01:10]. Cindy, thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. I love you."
"111","09-26-20"," Just yesterday President Trump paid a visit to Atlanta. Somehow my invitation was lost in the mail, but a fellow mayor asked me why was I missing yesterday when people greeted him at the airport and I told him, “I had scheduled an appointment to have my toenails removed one by one,” jokingly of course, but I think it really speaks to how I and so many mayors feel based on the challenges that we are facing under this administration. Someone comes to town, the President comes to town, not to help, but to continue to divide us. And so that is why before I get to removing my fingernails, one by one, I’m excited about Joe Biden being the next president of the United States. And I know my good friend, Eric Garcetti can tell you even more. Well, thank you, Keisha and thank you, Greg Fischer, Nan Whaley, the entire board for all of your leadership and what’s been an exceptional few days. I remember what it was like to have that partnership in the White House. When I got elected as mayor, it was 2013 and a group of us, the whole class of 2013 were invited into the Roosevelt Room in our nation’s Capitol at the White House, and Barack Obama and Joe Biden didn’t just want to have a photo op with the new mayors, they wanted to listen. For two hours, they went around the country, listening to the needs, the challenges, the hopes, and the dreams of America’s cities, and then followed up by visiting our cities and being those partners. I remember when Joe Biden came out to my city, Los Angeles to help us become the largest city in America, to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, when his secret weapon, Dr. Joe Biden came out to help us make community college free also the largest city in America to do so and helped us boost our college attendance from public school graduates by 50%. When he came out before Paris held the largest climate accord in the world between Chinese and US mayors in Los Angeles and helped us bring the summer games home back to America. You see a partnership with Joe Biden is just that. It’s friendship, he doesn’t ask for anything. He just believes in a better America and he knows as a former local official that it starts in local communities. That power doesn’t come from Washington to America, it comes from America and our 19,000 local communities to Washington DC. Keisha. So it’s my pleasure to introduce the next president of the United States, Joe Biden. Joe Biden. Hello everybody. Very great to be back with all of you and Keisha, thank you for your friendship and Eric yours as well. And you’re both been doing a heck of a job. Look, I want to thank everything you’re doing and for the faith you’ve placed in may so early on, but look, I’ve had the privilege of speaking to this body many, many times over the years from the time I was a senator and as Vice President, and I’ve always had enormous respect for just how tough your jobs are. I’m not being solicitous. I used to be a county councilman in Delaware. I only ran for the United States Senate because I realized how hard local office is. I kiddingly say that I did it because, I ran for the Senate because it was easier. But the quality of people’s lives is so much more in your hands and on your shoulders than anyone else. Making sure people feel safe walking down the street, making sure the garbage gets collected, making sure the schools are safe and open. All the concrete things that make everyday life or break everyday life. They’re not partisan things. They’re just practical things. People look to you, Democrats and Republicans. You’re also on the front lines of emergencies. From fires to floods, to school shootings, to public health issues, helping save lives as well as livelihoods. That’s why I’ve made it a priority of my entire career to work closely with you. From the time I got to the senate 180 years ago, as well as my tenure, as vice president. You know, if I have the honor of becoming your president, I make this commitment to you. You’re going to have an access directly to the White House. I’m going to be right there with you, helping you and your communities based on what you think you need and the challenge you’re facing because the president, the mayor pointed out that it is about all from the bottom up. It doesn’t go from the top down. We’re dealing with four historic crises all at once. A once in a century pandemic that has claimed over 200,000 American lives, a devastating economic recession, a long overdue reckoning on racial justice and a change in climate that’s ravaging communities all across the country. I need not tell that to Eric and the mayors in California and Oregon and Washington state. Not one of those crises should have a partisan dimension. I really mean that. Not one single one. If I get elected president, I’m not going to be the Democratic president, I’m going to be an American president. Whether you voted for me or against me, whether your city is red or blue, I’m going to be there. I promise you. Frankly, we should be able to address each one of these the same way mayors solve problems, by leading with the facts and with reality, putting the wellbeing of our constituents first, uniting people around solutions that work for everybody, but tragically, that isn’t how this current administration is wired. The only problems that matter to this president seem to be problems that affect him personally. He defines everything in a red and blue, blue states, red states, Democratic cities, Republican cities. I think that’s explains why one day before we hit 200,000 deaths, the president held a campaign rally and insisted that the virus was, “Affects virtually nobody.” Then he went on to say, “except elderly people with heart conditions and problems.” Ask the folks in their communities how they feel about that. Their parents that are being referred to by the president as nobodies. Ask their families of that empty seat at kitchen table this morning, if that’s true they’re nobodies. Kids who lost their teachers. Parents, and grandparents, friends or coworkers, sisters or brothers, never going to see again. The problems we’re facing affects all of us, every one of us in every community. I think this may be the toughest time in a long time to be a mayor, especially a big city mayor, but that’s not true across the board. Mayors have faced adversity before. Some of you remember back in 2008, the economy was in free fall. We were losing 700,000 jobs a month because of the recession we inherited. Families lost, and I know you remember this, families lost more than $16 trillion, families, in personal wealth. People who had never missed a mortgage payment, all of a sudden were underwater, being foreclosed on because of the number of foreclosures that occurred on their streets significantly reducing the value of their home. Was devastated. We didn’t solve it by saying, “You’re on your own. It’s what it is.” We came together. With your leadership, we passed and implemented the Recovery Act. We provided $140 billion in state and local fiscal relief, keeping law enforcement and firefighters on the job. We sent more than $50 billion to your school districts saving more than 300,000 education jobs. We provided the Middle Class Tax Relief, helping families send their kids to college, to buy their first home. We invested in the future. We put $48 billion in infrastructure projects building 42,000 miles of roads, nearly 27,000 bridges to go along with the biggest clean energy investment in all of our history, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. And I said then and I say again, you should be able to make the decisions of what your city most needs. It shouldn’t have to go through your state legislatures all the time. You should have an opportunity. Even conservative economist acknowledge that what we did saved us from a depression. When the president gave me the honor of leading the recovery effort, first thing I did, I went to the mayors. Some of you were still around then. I spoke with over 200 mayors. Because of you, we came through the moment together. I really mean it. I spoke on the phone constantly. That’s the same approach we should be taking today. It starts with your budgets. You have to balance your budgets. You’re getting squeezed like never before. Local services are getting pared back, municipal jobs are falling by the wayside, furloughs and layoffs, compounding the devastation. We still have no effective of national standard for curbing the virus, which is infuriating because scientists insist we can save 110,000… They expect close to 200,000 more lives to be lost between now and January. They insist we can save 110,000 by the end of the year by simply wearing masks, and that’s straightening your budget even more because it keeps businesses from opening, opening back up. It keeps emergency rooms full and holds down your cities from springing back to life. There is no reason, none, why we can’t work together, we can’t work together again to overcome these challenges. You all know the House passed the Heroes Act, which should provide $915 billion in local and state government. It’s collecting dust right now on the Senate. Majority leader who I know well says, “Let the states go bankrupt.” [inaudible 00:10:58] having a local emergency fund that drives resources straight to you, expand your health infrastructure, reimburses overtime pay for the essential workers and first responders. Whatever your community needs the most, it isn’t all about resources though. The time when people are crying out for justice, exercising the right to peacefully protest, it’s falling on you to keep the peace and god, it’s a tough job on any circumstances. It’s nearly impossible where the president scapegoats his mayors and fans the flame of division. We can work together to build trust and accountability between police and communities, to condemn all violence, while still addressing the pain and injustice that they’re feeling and rooting out systemic racism. And as you all deal with the effects of extreme weather, fires, floods, superstorms where it’s like we’ve never seen. We can work together to invest in our communities to make them more resilient to climate change. The problems are different in every… Some places it’s about flooding, some places it’s about being wiped out by storms along the coast where I live. Sometimes it’s about being safe, just keeping people safe from fires, but it also is about being able to create millions of jobs, modernizing your buildings and your transportation system, making your community stronger, greener, better position to seize the opportunities in the years ahead. That’s what I plan on doing to get to you. That’s what we did when I was vice-president. That’s what we’ll do if I have the honor of becoming your president. What we can’t do though, is divide ourselves into pieces. That’s the only strategy this president seems to know, but it doesn’t work. It can distract you from a problem. It can create a new problem that occupy your attention, but it can’t actually solve anything. You all know better than anyone, dividing ourselves gets us nowhere. We have to work together in good faith, competently, efficiently leading with the facts. We can disagree on policies but we have to cooperate. It’s only the way we’re going to come out of these crises and ensure that our best days are still ahead, which I firmly believe they are. That’s what we’ve done, tried to do in this campaign and that’s what I’ll do as president. Work with all of you. Democrats, Republicans, independents. As I said, if I’m elected president, I’m not going to be a democratic president, I’m going to be an American president. Blue cities, red cities it does not matter to me. I promise you. Every American community deserves the full support of an American president. Look, being a mayor and you know I’m not kidding about this, is hard under the best of circumstances, but the worst thing a president can do is to drive wedges and make your job tougher because he thinks it benefits him or stirs up chaos in your communities. You deserve a partner who’ll listen to you, who’ll work with you, work on your priorities. Someone who gets your back and saves your back, works to cover your back no matter what you are and no matter what challenge you’re facing. This moment we’re facing now, isn’t a partisan moment. It’s an American moment. It sounds corny, doesn’t it? But it’s true, it’s an American moment. It’s a chance for us to overcome anger and division that has hold us back of late for far too long. We can emerge from these crises. We can do what we’re best at doing, unite, work together. And it starts with the mayors. And I really mean that. It starts with all of you. I promise you. If I’m elected, you will have direct access to the White House. I want to thank you all because we need you to build back better. You are the foundation stone, not a joke. You’re the ones leading away. And what people don’t realize is over the last six years more young people are moving into cities than out of cities. There’s so many possibilities. We got to stop the hate and the division now, we got to stop pouring flames on the fire, we got to start talking straight to the American people. That’s what you all do. You do it every day. I want to make it clear to you, I’ve never been more optimistic and I’ve been doing this a long time about the prospects for this country than I am today. The blinders have been taken off the American people. They understand what’s going on now. They understand. They understand it’s about all of us. They want to get things done. And so it’s going to start with you. I promise you I’ll have your back. I mean that sincerely. Look in my record, I have, and I want to make sure that your ideas are the ones that are funneled up. They don’t have to go through a state legislature, go through a governor. They can go straight to the federal government, straight to me. I really mean it. So God bless you. May God protect our troops and thank you for what you do. Your job is too hard for me."
"112","09-29-20"," Good evening from the Health Education Campus of Case Western Reserve University and the Cleveland Clinic. I’m Chris Wallace of Fox News and I welcome you to the first of the 2020 Presidential Debates between President Donald J. Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden. This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential debates. The Commission has designed the format, six roughly 15 minute segments with two minute answers from each candidate to the first question, then open discussion for the rest of each segment. Both campaigns have agreed to these rules. For the record, I decided the topics and the questions in each topic. I can assure you none of the questions has been shared with the Commission or the two candidates. This debate is being conducted under health and safety protocols designed by the Cleveland Clinic, which is serving as the Health Security advisor to the Commission for all four debates. As a precaution, both campaigns have agreed the candidates will not shake hands at the beginning of tonight’s debate. The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent. No cheers, no boos, or other interruptions so we, and more importantly you, can focus on what the candidates have to say. No noise except right now, as we welcome the Republican nominee, President Trump, and the Democratic nominee Vice President Biden. How you doing, man? President Donald J. I’m well. Gentlemen, a lot of people been waiting for this night, so let’s get going. Our first subject is the Supreme Court. President Trump, you nominated Amy Coney Barrett over the weekend to succeed the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Court. You say the Constitution is clear about your obligation and the Senate’s to consider a nominee to the Court. Vice President Biden, you say that this is an effort by the President and Republicans to jam through on an appointment in what you call an abuse of power. My first question to both of you tonight, why are you right in the argument you make and your opponent wrong? And where do you think a Justice Barrett would take the court? President Trump, in this first segment, you go first. Two minutes. President Donald J. Thank you very much, Chris. I will tell you very simply. We won the election. Elections have consequences. We have the Senate, we have the White House, and we have a phenomenal nominee respected by all. Top, top academic, good in every way. Good in every way. In fact, some of her biggest endorsers are very liberal people from Notre Dame and other places. So I think she’s going to be fantastic. We have plenty of time. Even if we did it after the election itself. I have a lot of time after the election, as you know. So I think that she will be outstanding. She’s going to be as good as anybody that has served on that court. We really feel that. We have a professor at Notre Dame, highly respected by all, said she’s the single greatest student he’s ever had. He’s been a professor for a long time at a great school. President Donald J. And we won the election and therefore we have the right to choose her, and very few people knowingly would say otherwise. And by the way, the Democrats, they wouldn’t even think about not doing it. The only difference is they’d try and do it faster. There’s no way they would give it up. They had Merrick Garland, but the problem is they didn’t have the election so they were stopped. And probably that would happen in reverse, also. Definitely would happen in reverse. So we won the election and we have the right to do it, Chris. President Trump, thank you. Same question to you, Vice President Biden. You have two minutes. Well, first of all, thank you for doing this and looking forward to this, Mr. President. President Donald J. Thank you, Joe. The American people have a right to have a say in who the Supreme Court nominee is and that say occurs when they vote for United States Senators and when they vote for the President of United States. They’re not going to get that chance now because we’re in the middle of an election already. The election has already started. Tens of thousands of people already voted and so the thing that should happen is we should wait. We should wait and see what the outcome of this election is because that’s the only way the American people get to express their view is by who they elect as President and who they elect as Vice President. Now, what’s at stake here is the President’s made it clear, he wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. He’s been running on that, he ran on that and he’s been governing on that. He’s in the Supreme Court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which will strip 20 million people from having health insurance now, if it goes into court. And the justice, I’m not opposed to the justice, she seems like a very fine person. But she’s written, before she went in the bench, which is her right, that she thinks that the Affordable Care Act is not Constitutional. The other thing that’s on the court, and if it’s struck down, what happens? Women’s rights are fundamentally changed. Once again, a woman could pay more money because she has a pre-existing condition of pregnancy. They’re able to charge women more for the same exact procedure a man gets. And that ended when we, in fact, passed the Affordable Care Act, and there’s a hundred million people who have pre-existing conditions and they’ll be taken away as well. Those pre-existing conditions, insurance companies are going to love this. And so it’s just not appropriate to do this before this election. If he wins the election and the Senate is Republican, then he goes forward. If not, we should wait until February. President Donald J. There aren’t a hundred million people with pre-existing conditions. As far as a say is concerned, the people already had their say. Okay, Justice Ginsburg said very powerfully, very strongly, at some point 10 years ago or so, she said a President and the Senate is elected for a period of time, but a President is elected for four years. We’re not elected for three years. I’m not elected for three years. He’s elected to the next election. President Donald J. During that period of time, during that period of time, we have an opening. I’m not elected for three years. I’m elected for four years. Joe, the hundred million people is totally wrong. I don’t know where you got that number. The bigger problem that you have is that you’re going to extinguish 180 million people with their private health care, that they’re very happy this. That’s simply not true. President Donald J. Well, you’re certainly going to socialist. Gentlemen, we’re now into open discussion. Open discussion. Open discussion, yes, I agree. Go ahead, Vice President. Number one, he knows what I proposed. What I proposed is that we expand Obamacare and we increase it. We do not wipe any. And one of the big debates we had with 23 of my colleagues trying to win the nomination that I won, were saying that Biden wanted to allow people to have private insurance still. They can. They do. They will under my proposal. President Donald J. That’s not what you’ve said and it’s not what your party is saying. That is simply a lie. President Donald J. Your party doesn’t say it. Your party wants to go socialist medicine and socialist healthcare. The party is me. Right now, I am the Democratic Party. President Donald J. And they’re going to dominate you, Joe. You know that. I am the Democratic Party right now. President Donald J. Not according to Harris. The platform of the Democratic Party is what I, in fact, approved of, what I approved of. Now, here’s the deal. The deal is that it’s going to wipe out pre-existing conditions. And, by the way, the 20, the 200 mil- the 200,000 people that have died on his watch, how many of those have survived? Well, there’s seven million people that contracted COVID. What does it mean for them going forward if you strike down the Affordable Care Act? President Donald J. Joe, you’ve had 308,000 military people dying because you couldn’t provide them proper healthcare in the military. So don’t tell me about this. I’m happy to talk about this. President Donald J. And if you were here, it wouldn’t be 200, it would be two million people because you were very late on the draw. You didn’t want me to ban China, which was heavily infected. You didn’t want me to ban Europe. All right, gentlemen, Mr. President. President Donald J. You would have been much later, Joe, much later. Mr. President. President Donald J. We’re talking about two million people. You’re not going to be able to shut him up. Mr. President, as the moderator, we are going to talk about COVID in the next segment. But go ahead. Let me finish. The point is that the President also is opposed to Roe V. Wade. That’s on the ballot as well and the court, in the court, and so that’s also at stake right now. And so the election is all- President Donald J. You don’t know what’s on the ballot. Why is it on the ballot? Why is it on the ballot? It’s not on the ballot. It’s on the ballot in the court. President Donald J. I don’t think so. In the court. President Donald J. There’s nothing happening there. Donald would you just be quiet for a minute. President Donald J. You don’t know her view on Roe V. Wade? You don’t know here view. Well, all right. All right. Let’s talk. We’ve got a lot to unpack here, gentlemen. We’ve got a lot of time. On healthcare, and then we’ll come back to Roe V. Wade. All right. Mr. President, the Supreme Court will hear a case a week after the election in which the Trump Administration, along with 18 state Attorney Generals are seeking to overturn Obamacare, to end Obamacare. President Donald J. That’s right. You have spent the last week- President Donald J. Because they want to give good healthcare. If I may ask my question, sir. Good healthcare. Over the last four years, you have promised to repeal and replace Obamacare, but you have never in these four years come up with a plan, a comprehensive plan, to replace Obamacare. President Donald J. Yes, I have. Of course, I have. The individual mandate. [crosstalk 00:11:26] when I finish I’m going to give an opportunity- President Donald J. Excuse me. I got rid of the individual mandate, which was a big chunk of Obamacare. That’s not a comprehensive place. President Donald J. That is absolutely a big thing. That was the worst part of Obamacare. I didn’t ask, sir. President Donald J. Chris, that was the worst part of Obamacare. You’re debating him not me. Let me ask my question. President Donald J. Well, I’ll ask Joe. The individual mandate was the most unpopular aspect of Obamacare. Mr. President. President Donald J. I got rid of it. And we will protect people. Mr. President, I’m the moderator of this debate and I would like you to let me ask my question and then you can answer. President Donald J. Go ahead. You, in the course of these four years, have never come up with a comprehensive plan to replace Obamacare, and just this last Thursday you signed a largely symbolic Executive Order to protect people with pre-existing conditions five days before this debate. So my question, sir, is what is the Trump healthcare plan? President Donald J. Well, first of all, I guess I’m debating you, not him, but that’s okay. I’m not surprised. Let me just tell you something. There’s nothing symbolic. I’m cutting drug prices. I’m going with Favored Nations, which no President has the courage to do because you’re going against big pharma. Drug prices will be coming down 80 or 90%. You could have done it during your 47 year period in government, but you didn’t do it. Nobody’s done it. So we’re cutting healthcare. What about pre-existing conditions? President Donald J. All of the things that we’ve done. He has not done healthcare. President Donald J. I’ll give you an example. Insulin, it was destroying families, destroying people, the cost. I’m getting it for so cheap it’s like water, you want to know the truth. So cheap. Take a look at all of the drugs that what we’re doing. Prescription drug prices, we’re going to allow our Governors now to go to other countries to buy drugs because when they paid just a tiny fraction of what we do. Okay, like I say, this is open discussion. President Donald J. This is big stuff. Sir, you’ll be happy. I’m about to pick up on one of your points to ask the Vice President, which is, he points out that you would like to add a public option to Obamacare. Yes. And the argument that he makes and other Republicans make is that that is going to end private insurance. It is not. If I start asking the question. President Donald J. That’s not what your party says, by the way. And it will end private insurance and create a government takeover of health. It does not. It’s only for those people who are so poor they qualify for Medicaid they can get that free in most States, except Governors who want to deny people who are poor Medicaid. Anyone who qualifies for Medicare, excuse me, Medicaid would automatically be enrolled in the public option. The vast majority of the American people would still not be in that option. Number one. Number two. President Donald J. Joe, you agreed with Bernie Sanders, who’s far left, on the manifesto, we call it. And that gives you socialized medicine. Look, hey. President Donald J. I’m not going to listen to him. The fact of the matter is I beat Bernie Sanders. President Donald J. Not by much. I beat him by a whole hell of a lot. President Donald J. Not by much. I’m here standing facing you, old buddy. President Donald J. If Pocahontas would have left two days early you would have lost every primary. All he knows how to do- President Donald J. On Super Tuesday, you got very lucky. Look he’s the deal. I got very lucky. I’m going to get very lucky tonight as well. President Donald J. And tonight I’m going to make sure. President Donald J. Because here’s the deal, here’s the deal. The fact is that everything he’s saying so far is simply a lie. I’m not here to call out his lies. Everybody knows he’s a liar. President Donald J. But you agree. Joe, you’re the liar. You graduated last in your class not first in your class. Mr. No, he doesn’t know how to do that. President Donald J. You’d be surprised. You’d be surprised. Go ahead, Joe. The wrong guy, the wrong night, at the wrong time. President Donald J. Listen, you agreed with Bernie Sanders and the manifesto. There is no manifesto, number one. Please let him speak, Mr. President. Number two. President Donald J. He just lost the left. Number two. President Donald J. You just lost the left. You agreed with Bernie Sanders on a plan that you absolutely agreed to and under that plan [crosstalk 00:15:10], they call it socialized medicine. Mr. President. I’ll tell you what, he is not for any help for people needing healthcare. President Donald J. Because he, in fact, already has costs 10 million people their healthcare that they had from their employers because of his recession. Number one. Number two, there are 20 million people getting healthcare through Obamacare now that he wants to take it away. He won’t ever look you in the eye and say that’s what he wants to do. Take it away. President Donald J. No, I want to give them better healthcare at a much lower price, because Obamacare is no good. He doesn’t know how. He doesn’t know how to do that. President Donald J. I’ve already fixed it. He has never offered a plan. President Donald J. We’ve already fixed it to an extent. Obamacare, as you might know but probably don’t, Obamacare is no good. Gentlemen, you realize if you’re both speaking at the same time. Let the President. Go ahead, sir. President Donald J. Obamacare is no good. We made it better and I had a choice to make very early on. We took away the individual mandate. We guaranteed pre-existing conditions, but took away the individual mandate. Listen, this is the way it is. And that destroyed … They shouldn’t even call it Obamacare, then I had a choice to make, do I let my people run it really well or badly? If I run it badly, they’ll probably blame him, but they’ll blame me. But more importantly, I want to help people. Okay. I said, “You’ve got to run it so well.” And I just had a meeting with them. They said the problem is, no matter how well you run Obamacare, it’s a disaster. It’s too expensive. Premiums are too high, that it doesn’t work. So we do want to get rid of it. Chris, we want to get rid of that and give something that’s cheaper and better. I understand that, sir. But I have to give you roughly equal time. President Donald J. Go ahead. Please let the Vice President talk, sir. President Donald J. Good. He has no plan for healthcare. President Donald J. Of course, we do. Please. He sends out wishful thinking. He has Executive Orders that have no power. He hasn’t lowered drug costs for anybody. He’s been promising a healthcare plan since he got elected. He has none, like almost everything else he talks about. He does not have a plan. He doesn’t have a plan. And the fact is this man doesn’t know what he’s talking about. [crosstalk 00:17:14]. All right, I have one final question for you. Sure. Mr. Vice President, if Senate Republicans, we were talking originally about the Supreme Court here, if Senate Republicans go ahead and confirm Justice Barrett there has been talk about ending the filibuster or even packing the court, adding to the nine justices there. You call this a distraction by the President. But, in fact, it wasn’t brought up by the President. It was brought up by some of your Democratic colleagues in the Congress. Whatever position I take on that, that’ll become the issue. The issue is the American people should speak. You should go out and vote. You’re voting now. Vote and let your Senators know strongly how you feel. President Donald J. Vote now. President Donald J. Make sure you, in fact, let people know, your Senators. President Donald J. He doesn’t want to answer the question. I’m not going to answer the question. President Donald J. Why wouldn’t you answer that question? You want to put a lot of new Supreme Court Justices. Radical left. Will you shut up, man? President Donald J. This is so un-Presidential. President Donald J. He’s going to pack the court. He is not going to give a list. We have ended the segment. We’re going to move on to the second segment. That was really a productive segment, wasn’t it? Keep yapping, man. President Donald J. The people understand, Joe. They sure do. President Donald J. 47 years, you’ve done nothing. They’re understand. All right, the second subject is COVID-19, which is an awfully serious subject. So let’s try to be serious about it. We have had more than seven million cases of coronavirus in the United States and more than 200,000 people have died. Even after we produce a vaccine, experts say that it could be months or even years before we come back to anything approaching normal. My question for both of you is, based on what you have said and done so far, and what you have said you would do starting in 2021, why should the American people trust you more than your opponent to deal with this public health crisis going forward? In this case, the question goes to you first, sir. Two minutes, uninterrupted. Good luck. 200,000 dead. As you said, over seven million infected in the United States. We, in fact, have 4% of the world’s population, 20% of the deaths. 40,000 people a day are contracting COVID. In addition to that, about between 750 and 1000 people a day are dying. When he was presented with that number, he said, “It is what it is.” Well, it is what it is because you are who you are. That’s why it is. The President has no plan. He hasn’t laid out anything. He knew all the way back in February how serious this crisis was. He knew it was a deadly disease. What did he do? He’s on tape as acknowledging he knew it. He said he didn’t tell us or give people a warning of it because he didn’t want to panic the American people. You don’t panic. He panicked. He went in and we were insisting that the people we had in the ground in China should be able to go to Wuhan and determine for themselves how dangerous this was. He did not even ask Xi to do that. President Donald J. Wrong. He told us what a great job Xi was doing. He said we owe him debt of gratitude for being so transparent with us. And what did he do then? He then did nothing. He waited and waited and waited. He still doesn’t have a plan. President Donald J. Wrong. Sir, it’s his two minutes. President Donald J. It’s so wrong. I laid out back in March, exactly what we should be doing. And I laid out again in July, what we should be doing. We should be providing all the protective gear possible. We should be providing the money the House has passed in order to be able to go out and get people the help they need to keep their businesses open. Open schools cost a lot of money. You should get out of your bunker and get out of the sand trap in your golf course and go in the Oval Office and bring together the Democrats and Republicans and fund what needs to be done now to save lives. President Donald J. So, if we would have listened to you. Wait, wait. You have two minutes, sir. President Donald J. If we would’ve listened to you, the country would have been left wide open, millions of people would have died, not 200,000. And one person is too much. It’s China’s fault. It should have never happened. They stopped it from going in, but it was China’s fault. And, by the way, when you talk about numbers, you don’t know how many people died in China. You don’t know how many people died in Russia. You don’t know how many people died in India. They don’t exactly give you a straight count, just so you understand. But if you look at what we’ve done, I closed it and you said, “He’s xenophobic. He’s a racist and he’s xenophobic,” because you didn’t think I should have closed our country. Wait a minute. Sir, it’s his two minutes. President Donald J. You didn’t think we should have closed our country because you thought it was terrible. You wouldn’t have closed it for another two months. By my doing it early, in fact, Dr. Fauci said, “President Trump saved thousands of lives.” Many of your Democrat Governors said, “President Trump did a phenomenal job.” We worked with the Governor. Oh really, go take a look. The Governors said I did a phenomenal job. Most of them said that. In fact, people that would not be necessarily on my side said that, “President Trump did a phenomenal job.” We did. We got the gowns. We got the masks. We made the ventilators. You wouldn’t have made ventilators. And now we’re weeks away from a vaccine. We’re doing therapeutics already. Fewer people are dying when they get sick. Far fewer people are dying. We’ve done a great job. President Donald J. The only thing I haven’t done a good job, and that’s because of the fake news, no matter what you say to them, they give you a bad press on it. It’s just fake news. They give you good press, they give me bad press because that’s the way it is, unfortunately. But let me just say something. I don’t care. I’ve gotten used to it. But I’ll tell you, Joe, you could never have done the job that we did. You don’t have it in your blood. You could’ve never done that, Joe. I know how to do the job. I know how to get the job done. President Donald J. Well, you didn’t do very well in Swine Flu. H1-N1, you were a disaster. Your own Chief of Staff said you were a disaster. 14,000 people died, not 200,000. President Donald J. A far less lethal disease, by the way. Sir, you made a point. Let him answer it. And there was no one … We didn’t shut down the economy. This is his economy he shut down. The reason it’s shut down is because, look, you folks at home. How many of you got up this morning and had an empty chair at the kitchen table because someone died of COVID? How many of you are in a situation where you lost your mom or dad and you couldn’t even speak to them, you had a nurse holding a phone up so you could in fact say goodbye? President Donald J. We would have lost far more people, far more people. You would have been months late. You’re months behind me, Joe. His own CDC Director says we could lose as many as another 200,000 people between now and the end of the year. And he said, if we just wear a mask, we can save half those numbers. Just a mask. And by the way, in terms of the whole notion of a vaccine, we’re for a vaccine, but I don’t trust him at all. Nor do you. I know you don’t. What we trust is a scientist. President Donald J. You don’t trust Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer?   Part 2 Chris Wallace: Okay, gentlemen, gentlemen. Let me move on to questions about the future because you both have touched on two of the questions I’m going to ask. Focusing on the future first, President Trump, you have repeatedly either contradicted or been at odds with some of your governments own top scientists. The week before last, the Head of the Centers for Disease Control, Dr. Redfield said it would be summer before the vaccine would become generally available to the public. You said that he was confused and mistaken. Those were your two words. But Dr. Slaoui, the head of your Operation Warp Speed, has said exactly the same thing. Are they both wrong? President Donald J. Well, I’ve spoken to the companies and we can have it a lot sooner. It’s a very political thing because people like this would rather make it political than save lives. God. President Donald J. It is a very political thing. I’ve spoken to Pfizer, I’ve spoken to all of the people that you have to speak to, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, and others. They can go faster than that by a lot. It’s become very political because the left… Or I don’t know if I call them left, I don’t know what I call them. So you’re suggesting that the head of your Operation Warp Speed, Dr. Slaoui- President Donald J. I disagree with him. No, I disagree with both of them. And he didn’t say that. He said it could be there, but it could also be much sooner. I had him in my office two days ago. He talked about the summer, sir, before it’s generally available, just like Dr. Redfield. President Donald J. Because he said it’s a possibility that we’ll have the answer before November 1st. It could also be after that. I’m talking about when it’s generally available, not- President Donald J. Well, we’re going to deliver it right away. We have the military all set up. Logistically, they’re all set up. We have our military that delivers soldiers and they can do 200,000 a day. This is the same man who told you- President Donald J. It’s all set up. … by Easter, this would be gone away. By the warm weather, it’d be gone. Miraculous, like a miracle. And by the way, maybe you could inject some bleach in your arm, and that would take care of it. This is the same man. President Donald J. That was said sarcastically, and you know that. That was said sarcastically. So here’s the deal. This man is talking about a vaccine. Every serious company is talking about maybe having a vaccine done by the end of the year, but the distribution of that vaccine will not occur until sometime beginning of the middle of next year to get it out, if we get the vaccine. And pray God we will. Pray God we will. Mr. Vice President, I want to pick up- President Donald J. You’ll have the vaccine sooner than that. I want to pick up on this question though. You say the public can trust the scientists, but they can’t trust President Trump. In fact, you said that again tonight. Your running mate, Senator Harris, goes further, saying that public health experts quote, “Will be muzzled, will be suppressed. No more than the question you just asked him. You pointed out he puts pressure and disagrees with his own scientists. Or Senator Harris is saying you can’t trust the scientist. Well, no, no. You can trust the scientist. She didn’t say that. She said that public health experts quote, “Will be muzzled, will be suppressed. Yes. Well, that’s what he’s going to try to do, but there’s thousands of scientists out there, like here at this great hospital that don’t work for him. Their job doesn’t depend on him. They’re the people… And by the way- President Donald J. By the way- President Donald J. … they will have the vaccine very soon. Let him finish. Do you believe for a moment what he’s telling you in light of all the lies he’s told you about the whole issue relating to COVID? He still hasn’t even acknowledged that he knew this was happening, knew how dangerous it was going to be back in February, and he didn’t even tell you. He’s on record as saying it. He panicked or he just looked at the stock market. One of the two. Mr. President? President Donald J. Did you use the word smart? So you said you went to Delaware State, but you forgot the name of your college. You didn’t go to Delaware State. You graduated either the lowest or almost the lowest in your class. Don’t ever use the word smart with me. Don’t ever use that word. Oh, give me a break. President Donald J. Because you know what? There’s nothing smart about you, Joe. 47 years you’ve done nothing. Well, let’s have this debate- President Donald J. Let me just tell you something, Joe. If you would have had the charge of what I was put through, I had to close the greatest economy of the history of our country. And by the way, now it’s being built again and it’s going up fast. We’ll get to the economy in the next segment, sir. President Donald J. Okay. It’s going up fast. I look forward to talking about it. Okay. When it comes to how the virus has been handled so far, the two of you have taken very different approaches, and this is going to affect how the virus is handled going forward by whichever of you ends up becoming the next president. I want to quickly go through several of those. Reopenings. Vice President Biden, you have been much more reluctant than President Trump about reopening the economy and schools. Because he doesn’t have a plan. If I were running it, I’d know what the plan is. You’ve got to provide these businesses the ability to have the money to be able to reopen with the PPE, as well as with the sanitation they need. You have to provide them classic- President Donald J. Tell that to Nancy Pelosi. Will he just shush for a minute? President Donald J. Tell that to Nancy Pelosi, and Schumer [crosstalk 00:04:52] Chuck. Nancy Pelosi and Schumer, they have a plan. He won’t even meet with them. The Republicans won’t meet in the Senate. He sits in his golf course. Well, I mean, literally, think about it. Think about it. President Donald J. You probably play more than I do, Joe. What about this question of reopenings and the fact- President Donald J. You just admitted you’d shut it down. President Donald J. Wait a minute, Joe. Let me shut you down for a second, Joe, just for one second. He wants to shut down the country. We just went through it. We had to, because we didn’t know anything about the disease. Now we’ve found that elderly people with heart problems and diabetes and different problems are very, very vulnerable. We learned a lot. Young children aren’t, even younger people aren’t. We’ve learned a lot, but he wants to shut it down. More people will be hurt by continuing. If you look at Pennsylvania, if you look at certain states that have been shut down, they have Democrat governors, all, one of the reasons they shut down is because they want to keep it shut down until after the election on November 3rd. All right. I want to move onto another- President Donald J. Because it’s a political thing. I want to move onto another subject. I got to respond to that. I want to move- President Donald J. Gentlemen, I want to move onto another subject. President Donald J. Those states are not doing well that are shut down right now. I got to respond to that. President Donald J. He wants to shut down the whole country. President Trump, you have begun to increasingly question the effectiveness of masks as a disease preventer. And in fact, recently you have cited the issue of waiters touching their masks and touching plates. Are you questioning the efficacy of masks? President Donald J. No, I think masks are okay. You have to understand, if you look… I mean, I have a mask right here. I put a mask on when I think I need it. Just like your rally. President Donald J. … when needed. When needed, I wear masks. Okay. Let me ask- President Donald J. I don’t wear a mask like him. Every time you see him, he’s got a mask. He could be speaking 200 feet away from him and he shows up with the biggest mask I’ve ever seen. Vice President Biden, go ahead, sir. Look, the way to open businesses is give them the wherewithal to be able open. But I was asking you, sir, about masks. Well, masks make a big difference. His own head of the CDC said if we just wore masks between now, if everybody wore a mask and social distanced between now and January, we’d probably save up to 100,000 lives. It matters. It matters. President Donald J. And they’ve also said the opposite. No serious person has said the opposite. No serious person. Okay. I want to ask you- President Donald J. Dr. Fauci. Dr. Fauci said the opposite. He did not say the opposite. I want to ask you, we’ve got a little than a minute left in this segment. President Donald J. He said very strongly, “Masks are not good.” Then he changed his mind. He said, “Masks are good. I want to ask- President Donald J. I’m okay with masks. I’m not fighting masks. I want to ask you both about one last subject because your different approaches has even affected the way that you have campaigned. President Trump, you’re holding large rallies with crowds packed together, thousands of people. President Donald J. Outside. Outside. Yes, sir. Agreed. Vice President Biden, you are holding much smaller events with- President Donald J. Because nobody will show up. … people with masks. President Donald J. Well, it’s true. Nobody shows up to his rallies. All right. In any case, why you holding the big rallies? Why you not? You go first, sir. President Donald J. Because people want to hear what I have to say. But are not worried about us spreading disease? President Donald J. … I’m doing my job as a president, and I’ll have 25, 35,000 people show up at airports. Are you not worried about the disease issues, sir? President Donald J. Well, so far we have had no problem whatsoever. It’s outside. That’s a big difference according to the experts. We do them outside, we have tremendous crowds, as you see, and literally on 24 hours notice. And Joe does the circles and has three people someplace. By the way, did you see one of the last big rallies he had? A reporter came up to him to ask him a question, he said, “No, no, no. Stand back, put on your mask, put on a mask. Have you been tested? I’m way far away from those other people.” That’s what he said, “I’m going to be okay.” He’s not worried about you. He’s not worried about the people out there [crosstalk 00:08:48]. President Donald J. We’ve had no negative effect. No negative effect. Come on. President Donald J. We’ve had no negative effect, and we’ve had 35, 40,000 people at these rallies. All right. Yes, I would. He’s been totally irresponsible the way in which he has handled the social distancing and people wearing masks, basically encouraged them not to. He’s a fool on this. President Donald J. If you could get the crowds, you would have done the same thing. But you can’t. Nobody cares. Gentlemen, can we move on to the- President Donald J. No cares. Gentlemen, can we move on to the economy? President Donald J. Yes. The economy is, I think it’s fair to say, recovering faster than expected from the shutdown- President Donald J. Much faster. … in the second quarter. The unemployment rate fell to 8.4% last month. The Federal Reserve says the hit to growth, which is going to be there, is not going to be nearly as big as they had expected. President Trump, you say we are in a V-shaped recovery. Vice President Biden, you say it’s more of a K-shape. What difference does that mean to the American people in terms of the economy? President Trump, in this segment you go first. President Donald J. So we built the greatest economy in history. We closed it down because of the China plague. When the plague came in, we closed it down, which was very hard psychologically to do. He didn’t think we should close it down and he was wrong. Again, two million people would be dead now instead of… Still, 204,000 people is too much. One person is too much. Should have never happened from China. But what happened is we closed it down and now we’re reopening and we’re doing record business. We had 10.4 million people in a four month period that we’ve put back into the workforce. That’s a record the likes of which nobody’s ever seen before. And he wants to close down the… He will shut it down again. He will destroy this country. President Donald J. A lot of people, between drugs and alcohol and depression, when you start shutting it down, you take a look at what’s happening at some of your Democrat-run states where they have these tough shutdowns. And I’m telling you it’s because they don’t want to open it. One of them came out last week, you saw that, “Oh, we’re going to open up on November 9th.” Why November 9th? Because it’s after the election. They think they’re hurting us by keeping them closed. They’re hurting people. People know what to do. They can social distance. They can wash their hands, they can wear masks. They can do whatever they want, but they got to open these states up. President Donald J. When you look at North Carolina, when you look, and these governors are under siege, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and a couple of others, you got to open these states up. It’s not fair. You’re talking about almost it’s like being in prison. And you look at what’s going on with divorce, look at what’s going on with alcoholism and drugs. It’s a very, very sad thing. And he’ll close down the whole country. This guy will close down the whole country and destroy our country. Our country is coming back incredibly well, setting records as it does it. We don’t need somebody to come in and say, “Let’s shut it down. All right. Your two minutes, sir. We’re now moved to you. As I said, posing the question, the president says it’s a V-shape recovery, you say it’s a K-shaped recovery. The difference is millionaires and billionaires like him in the middle of the COVID crisis have done very well. Billionaires have made another $300 billion because of his profligate tax proposal, and he only focused on the market. But you folks at home, you folks living in Scranton and Claymont and all the small towns and working class towns in America, how well are you doing? This guy paid a total of $750 in taxes. President Donald J. That’s wrong. Sir, wait. No. Sir- President Donald J. [crosstalk 00:12:19]. Yeah, I understand. You’ve agreed to the two minutes, so please let him have it. Do I get my time back? The fact is that he has in fact, worked on this in a way that he’s going to be the first president of the United States to leave office, having fewer jobs in his administration than when he became president. Fewer jobs than when he became president. First one in American history. Secondly, the people who have lost their jobs are those people who have been on the front lines. Those people who have been saving our lives, those people who have been out there dying. People who’ve been putting themselves in the way to make sure that we could all try to make it. And the idea that he is insisting that we go forward and open when you have almost half the states in America with a significant increase in COVID deaths and COVID cases in the United States of America, and he wants to open it up more. Why is he want to open it up? Why does he take care of the… You can’t fix the economy until you fix the COVID crisis. And he has no intention of doing anything about making it better for you all at home in terms of your health and your safety. Schools. Why aren’t schools open? Because it costs a lot of money to open them safely. They were going to give, his administration going to give the teachers and school students masks, and then they decided no, couldn’t do that because it’s not a national emergency. Not a national emergency. They’ve done nothing to help small businesses. Nothing. They’re closing. One in six is now gone. He ought to get on the job and take care of the needs of the American people so we can open safely. All right. Your time is up, sir. We are going to get to- President Donald J. I have to respond to that. Well, you both had two minutes, sir. President Donald J. Excuse me, he made a statement. And so did you. President Donald J. No, people want their schools open. They don’t want to be shut down. They don’t want their state shut down. They want their restaurants. I look at New York. It’s so sad what’s happening in New York. It’s almost like a ghost town, and I’m not sure it can ever recover what they’ve done to New York. People want their places open. They want to get back to their lives. People want to be safe. President Donald J. They’ll be careful, but they want their schools open. People want to be safe. President Donald J. I’m the one that brought back football. By the way, I brought back Big Ten football. All right. Let’s- President Donald J. … and people of Ohio are very proud of me. And you know how I found out? When [crosstalk 00:14:35]. Gentlemen, we’re going to get to your economic plans going forward in a moment, but first, Mr. President, as you well know, there’s a new report that in 2016, the year you were elected president, and 2017, your first year as president, that you paid $750 a year in federal income tax each of those years. I know that you pay a lot of other taxes, but I’m asking you this specific question. Is it true that you paid $750 in federal income taxes each of those two years? President Donald J. I paid millions of dollars in taxes, millions of dollars of income tax. Show us your tax returns. President Donald J. I paid $38 million one year, I paid $27 million one year. Show us your tax returns. President Donald J. You’ll see it as soon as it’s finished, you’ll see it. You know, if you wanted to, go to the Board of Elections. There’s 118 page or so report that says everything I have, every bank I have, I’m totally under leveraged because the assets are extremely good, and I built a great company. Sir, I’m asking you a specific question, which is- President Donald J. I understand all of that. Release your tax return. I understand all of that- President Donald J. No, Mr. President, I’m asking you a question. Will you tell us how much you paid in federal income taxes in 2016 and 2017? President Donald J. Millions of dollars. You paid millions of dollars in- President Donald J. Millions of dollars, yes. So not 750? President Donald J. Millions of dollars. And you’ll get to see it. And you’ll get to see it. When? Inshallah? President Donald J. In [crosstalk 00:16:04]? President Donald J. Chris, let me just say something, that it was the tax laws. I don’t want to pay tax. Before I came here, I was a private developer, I was a private business people. Like every other private person, unless they’re stupid, they go through the laws, and that’s what it is. He passed a tax bill that gave us all these privileges for depreciation and for tax credits. We build the building and we get tax credits, like the hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue. Which by the way, was given to me by the Obama administration, if you can believe that. Yeah, I do want to respond. Look, the tax code that put him in a position that he pays less tax than on the money a school teacher makes is because of him… He says he’s smart because he can take advantage of the tax code. And he does take advantage of the tax code. That’s why I’m going to eliminate the Trump tax cuts. And I’m going to eliminate those tax cuts. President Donald J. That’s okay. And make sure that we invest in the people who in fact need the help. People out there need help. President Donald J. Because you weren’t president- President Donald J. Because you weren’t president and screwing things up. President Donald J. You’re the worst president America has ever had. Come on. President Donald J. Hey, Joe, let me just tell you, Joe. In 47 months, I’ve done more than you’ve done in 47 years, Joe. We’ve done things that you never even thought of doing. Okay. Gentlemen? President Donald J. Including fixing the broken military that you gave me, including taking care of your debts. Mr. President, we’re talking about the economy. I’d like to ask you about your plans going forward because Mr. Vice President, your economic plan- President Donald J. He has none. … if you were to be elected president focuses a lot on big government, big taxes, big spending. I want to focus first on the taxes. You propose more than $4 trillion over a decade in new taxes on individuals making more than $400,000 a year. … on individuals making more than $400,000 a year and on corporations. President Trump says that that kind of an increase in taxes is going to hurt the economy as it’s just coming out of a recession. Well, just take a look at what is the analysis done by Wall Street firms, points out that my economic plan would create 7 million more jobs than his in four years, number one. And number two, it would create an additional $1 trillion in economic growth, because it would be about buying American. The federal government spends $600 billion a year on everything from ships, to steel, to buildings and the like. But respectfully, sir, I’m talking about taxes, not spending. By the way, I’m going to eliminate a significant number of the taxes. I’m going to make the corporate tax 28%. It shouldn’t be 21%. You have 91 companies federal, I mean, the fortune 500, who don’t pay a single penny in tax making billions of dollars. President Donald J. Because you in fact passed that, that was your tax proposal. President Donald J. I got it done. Yeah, you got it done- President Donald J. Our economy boomed like it’s never boomed before. Mr. Let me finish. Mr. President, let me pick up on that. Not lower tax for the American people. But let me- President Donald J. Excuse me. You talk about the economy booming. It turns out that in Obama’s final three years as president more jobs were created, a million and a half more jobs, than in the first three years of your presidency. President Donald J. They had the slowest economic recovery since 1929. It was the slowest recovery. Also, they took over something that was down here. All you had to do is turn on the lights and you pick up a lot. But they had the slowest economic recovery since 1929, and let me tell you about the stock market. When the stock market goes up, that means jobs. It also means 401ks. If you got in, if you ever became president with your ideas, you want to terminate my taxes. I’ll tell you what, you’ll lose. Half of the companies that have poured in here will leave. And plenty of companies that are already here, they’ll leave for other places. [crosstalk 00:20:25] They will leave and you will have a depression, the likes of which you’ve never seen. Mr. Vice President. … we inherited the worst recession, short of a depression in American history. I was asked to bring it back. We were able to have an economic recovery that created the jobs you’re talking about. We handed him a booming economy, he blew it. President Donald J. It wasn’t blooming. He blew it. President Donald J. He was in booming. It was the weakest recovery since 1929. Wait, wait, is it fair to say he blew it when, in fact- President Donald J. When COVID came along. … when there was record low unemployment before COVID. Yeah, because what he did, even before COVID, manufacturing went in the hole. Manufacturing went in a hole- President Donald J. Excuse me, Chris, wait. … number one. Number two- President Donald J. Chris. Number three. President Donald J. They said it would take… No, you’re on number two. No. President Donald J. Chris, Chris. This guy- President Donald J. … a miracle to bring back manufacturing. I brought back 700,000 jobs. They brought back nothing. They gave up on manufacturing. We did not. [crosstalk 00:21:21] President Donald J. … standard fare. I’m the guy that brought back the automobile industry. President Donald J. He totally gave up on manufacturing. I was asked to bring back Chrysler and General Motors. He brought them back right here in the state of Ohio and Michigan. He blew it. They’re gone. He blew it. And in fact, they’re gone- President Donald J. Ohio had the best year it’s ever had last year. Michigan had the best year they’ve ever had. That is not true. President Donald J. Many car companies came in from Germany, from Japan, went to Michigan, went to Ohio and they didn’t come in with you. [crosstalk 00:21:47]. Mr. Vice President, go ahead. And so you take a look at what he’s actually done. He’s done very little. His trade deals are the same way. He talks about these great trade deals. He talks about the art of the deal. China’s perfected the art of the steel. We have a higher deficit with China now than we did before. We have the highest trade deficit- President Donald J. China ate your lunch- [crosstalk 00:00:22:07]. … with Mexico. President Donald J. China ate your lunch, Joe. And no wonder your son goes in and he takes out billions of dollars. He takes out billions of dollars to manage. He makes millions of dollars. That is not true. President Donald J. None of that is true. President Donald J. Sir, you’ve asked him a question, let him answer it. None of that is true. President Donald J. Mr. Mr. President, please. Totally discredited. Totally discredited. And by the way- President Donald J. Mr. Vice- President Donald J. Mr. President. President Donald J. … dollars. That is not true. President Donald J. Mr. President, it’s an open discussion. Please- [crosstalk 00:22:56] President Donald J. It’s a fact. It is not a fact. Well, you have raised an issue, let the Vice President answer. It’s been totally discredited. President Donald J. Mr. My son did nothing wrong at Barisma- President Donald J. I think he did. Mr. President, let him answer. [crosstalk 00:23:13]. He doesn’t want to let me answer, because he knows I have the truth. His position has been totally thoroughly discredited- President Donald J. And you can- President Donald J. The media. by everybody. Well, by the media, by our allies. President Donald J. By the World Bank- President Donald J. … because they’re embarrassed. By everyone, has discredited. Mr. President, please stop. Even the people who testified under oath- President Donald J. So let me ask you this, Joe- [crosstalk 00:23:35]. Go ahead, I’m listening to you. Even the people under- President Donald J. He got three and a half million dollars from Moscow. … testified under oath in his administration said I did my job and I did it very well. President Donald J. I did it honorably. President Donald J. I’d like to know who they are. Well, I’ll give you the list of the people who- President Donald J. I’ll fire them. No, no. Go ahead, sir. I’m sure that you’ve already fired most of them, because they did a good job. President Donald J. Some people don’t do a good job. Go ahead. You get the- [crosstalk 00:23:57] Wait a minute. You get the final word, Mr. Well, it’s hard to get any word in with this clown. Excuse me, this person. President Donald J. No, no. Mr. President- [crosstalk 00:24:05] President Donald J. Three and a half million, Joe. That is simply not true. President Donald J. Look, here’s the deal. We want to talk about families and ethics. I don’t want to do that. I mean, his family, we could talk about all night. His family’s already- President Donald J. No, no- [crosstalk 00:06:20]. President Donald J. My family lost a fortune by coming down and helping us with governance. Mr. President- President Donald J. This is not about my family or his family. It’s about your family, the American people. [crosstalk 00:24:32] That’s not true. It doesn’t want to talk about what you need. You, the American people, it’s about you. That’s what we’re talking about here. That’s the end of the segment. We’re moving on. He didn’t take that. Vice President- President Donald J. Try to be honest. No. President Donald J. The answer to the question is no. President Donald J. Sir- President Donald J. That is absolutely not true. Stop. [crosstalk 00:25:02] Gentlemen, I hate to raise my voice, but I- [crosstalk 00:25:05] Why should I be different than the two of you? So here’s the deal. That’s a good point. We have six segments. We have ended that segment. We’re going to go to the next segment. In that segment, you each are going to have two uninterrupted moments. In those two interrupted minutes, Mr. President, you can say anything you want. I’m going to ask a question about race, but if you want to answer about something else, go ahead. But I think that the country would be better served, if we allowed both people to speak with fewer interruptions. I’m appealing to you, sir, to do that. President Donald J. Well, and him too. Well, frankly, you’ve been doing more interrupting than he has. President Donald J. Well, that’s all right, but he does plenty. Well, sir, less than- President Donald J. He does plenty. No, less than you have. Let’s please continue on. The issue of rice. Vice-President Biden, you say that President Trump’s response to the violence in Charlottesville three years ago, when he talked about very fine people on both sides, was what directly led you to launch this run for president. President Donald J. Oh yeah, sure. President Trump, you have often said that you believe you will have done more for Black Americans than any president with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln. President Donald J. That’s true. My question for the two of you, is why should voters trust you rather than your opponent to deal with the race issues facing this country over the next four years? Vice President Biden, you go first. It’s about equity and equality. It’s about decency. It’s about the constitution. And we have never walked away from trying to require equity for everyone, equality for the whole of America. But we’ve never accomplished it, but we’ve never walked away from it like he has done. It is true, the reason I got in the race is when those people… Close your eyes, remember what those people look like coming out of the fields, carrying torches, their veins bulging, just spewing anti-Semitic bile and accompanied by the Ku Klux Klan. A young woman got killed and they asked the president what he thought. He said, “There were very fine people on both sides.” No president’s ever said anything like that. [crosstalk 00:27:10]. … minute sir. … second point I’d make to you, is that when Floyd was killed, when Mr. Floyd was killed, there was a peaceful protest in front of the White House. What did he do? He came out of his bunker, had the military use tear gas on them so he could walk across to a church and hold up a Bible. And then what happened after that? The Bishop of that very church said that it was a disgrace. The general who was with him said all he ever wants to do is divide people, not unite people at all. This is a president who has used everything as a dog whistle, to try to generate racists hatred, racist division. This is a man who, in fact, you talk about helping African-Americans, one in 1000 African Americans has been killed because of the coronavirus. And if he doesn’t do something quickly, by the end of the year, one in 500 will have been killed. One in 500 African Americans. This man is as a savior of African-Americans? This man cares at all? This man’s done virtually nothing. Look, the fact is that you have to look at what he talks about. You have to look at what he did. And what he did has been disastrous for the African-American community. President Donald J. President Trump, you have two minutes. Why should Americans trust you over your opponent to deal race issues? President Donald J. You did a crime bill, 1994, where you call them super predators. African-Americans are super predators and they’ve never forgotten it. They’ve never forgotten it. No, no, sir. It’s his two minutes. President Donald J. So you did that and they call you a super predator and I’m letting people out of jail now, that you have treated the African-American population community, you have treated the black community about as bad as anybody in this country. You did the 1990… And that’s why, if you look at the polls, I’m doing better than any Republican has done in a long time, because they saw what you did. You call them super predators, and you’ve called them worse than that. Because you look back at your testimony over the years, you’ve called them a lot worse than that. As far as the church is concerned and as far as the generals are concerned, we just got the support of 250 military leaders and generals, total support. Law enforcement, almost every law enforcement group in the United States. I have Florida. I have Texas. I have Ohio. I have every… Excuse me, Portland, the sheriff just came out today and he said, “I support President Trump.” President Donald J. I don’t think you have any law enforcement. You can’t even say the word law enforcement. Because if you say those words, you’re going to lose all of your radical left supporters. And why aren’t you saying those words, Joe? Why don’t you say the words law enforcement? Because you know what? If called us in Portland, we would put out that fire in a half an hour. But they won’t do it, because they’re run by radical left Democrats. If you look at Chicago, if you look at any place you want to look, Seattle, they heard we were coming in the following day and they put up their hands and we got back Seattle. Minneapolis, we got it back, Joe, because we believe in law and order, but you don’t. The top 10 cities and just about the top 40 cities are run by Democrats, and in many cases radical left. And they’ve got you wrapped around their finger, Joe, to a point where you don’t want to say anything about law and order. And I’ll tell you what, the people of this country want and demand law and order and you’re afraid to even say it. All right. I want to return to the question of race. Vice President Biden, after the grand jury in the Breonna Taylor case decided not to charge any of the police with homicide, you said it raises the question, “Whether justice could be equally applied in America. Yes, there is. There’s systemic injustice in this country, in education and work and in law enforcement and the way in which it’s enforced. But look, the vast majority of police officers are good, decent, honorable men and women. They risk their lives every day to take care of us, but there are some bad apples. And when they occur, when they find them, they have to be sorted out. They have to be held accountable. They have to be held accountable. And what I’m going to do as President of the United States is call together an entire group of people at the White House, everything from the civil rights groups, to the police officers, to the police chiefs, and we’re going to work this out. We’re going to work this out. So we changed the way in which we have more transparency, in when these things happen. These cops aren’t happy to see what happened to George Floyd. These cops aren’t happy to see what happened to Breonna Taylor. Most don’t like it, but we have to have a system where people are held accountable when… And by the way, violence in response is never appropriate, never appropriate. Peaceful protest is, violence is never appropriate. All right, Mr.- President Donald J. President Trump- President Donald J. … and burn down your stores and kill people all over the place- [crosstalk 00:32:14]. That is not peaceful protest. President Donald J. No it’s not, but you say it is. President Trump, I’d like to continue with the issue of race. I promise we’re going to get to the issue of law and order in a moment. President Donald J. Fine. This month, your administration directed federal agencies to end racial sensitivity training that addresses white privilege or critical race theory. Why did you decide to do that, to end racial sensitivity training? And do you believe that there is systemic racism in this country, sir? President Donald J. I ended it because it’s racist. I ended it because a lot of people were complaining that they were asked to do things that were absolutely insane. That it a radical revolution that was taking place in our military, in our schools, all over the place. And you know it, and so does everybody else. What is radical about racial sensitivity training? President Donald J. If you were a certain person, you had no status in life. It was sort of a reversal. And if you look at the people, we were paying people hundreds of thousands of dollars to teach very bad ideas and frankly, very sick ideas. And really, they were teaching people to hate our country And I’m not going to do that. I’m not going to allow that to happen. We have to go back to the core values of this country. They were teaching people that our country is a horrible place. It’s a racist place. And they were teaching people to hate our country. And I’m not going to allow that to happen. Vice President Biden. Nobody’s doing that. He’s the racist. President Donald J. You just don’t know. Here’s the deal. I know a lot more about this- [crosstalk 00:15:43]. Let him finish. The fact is that there is racial insensitivity. People have to be made aware of what other people feel like, what insults them, what is demeaning to them. It’s important people know. Many people don’t want to hurt other people’s feelings, but it makes a big difference. It makes a gigantic difference in the way a child is able to grow up and have a sense of self-esteem. It’s a little bit like how this guy and his friends look down on so many people. They look down their nose on people like Irish Catholics, like me, who grow up in Scranton. They look down on people who don’t have money. They look down on people who are of a different faith. They looked down on people who are a different color. In fact, we’re all Americans. The only way we’re going to bring this country together is bring everybody together. There’s nothing we cannot do, if we do it together. We can take this on and we can defeat racism in American. Vice President… I mean, President Trump, sir. President Donald J. During the Obama-Biden administration, there was tremendous division. There was hatred. You look at Ferguson, you look at, or you go to very… Many places, look at Oakland. Look what happened in Oakland. Look what happened in Baltimore. Look what happened… Frankly, it was more violent than what I’m even seeing now. Oh my Lord. President Donald J. This is ridiculous. President Donald J. Absolutely ridiculous. President Donald J. … don’t want to talk, like you, about law and order. Violent crime- President Donald J. And you still haven’t mentioned. I’m in favor of law. You- [crosstalk 00:35:15]. President Donald J. You asked a question, let him finish. [crosstalk 00:35:18] Let him answer. Law and order with justice, where people get treated fairly. President Donald J. Okay. And the fact of the matter is, violent crime went down 17%, 15% in our administration. It’s gone up on his watch. President Donald J. It went down much more in ours. All right, we’re done- [crosstalk 00:35:35] Mr. President, you’re going to be very happy because we’re now going to talk about law and order. President Donald J. That’s exactly my question. There has been a dramatic increase in homicides in America this summer particularly, and you often blame that on democratic mayors and democratic governors. But in fact, there have been equivalent spikes in Republican led cities, like Tulsa and Fort Worth. It’s like Tulsa and Fort worth. So the question is, is this really a party issue? President Donald J. I think as a party issue, you can bring in a couple of examples but if you look at Chicago, what’s going on in Chicago where a 53 people were shot and eight died shot, if you look at New York where it’s going up, like nobody’s ever seen anything. The numbers are going up a 100%, 150%, 200% crime, it is crazy what’s going on and he doesn’t want to say law and order because he can’t because he’ll lose his radical left supporters and once he does that, it’s over with. But if he ever got to run this country and they ran it the way he would want to run it, we would have by the way our suburbs would be gone. And you would see problems like you’ve never seen before. He wouldn’t know a suburb unless you took a wrong turn. President Donald J. Oh, I know suburbs so much that you. Gentlemen wait a minute. I was raised in the suburbs. This is not 1950. All these dog whistles and racism don’t work anymore. Suburbs are by and large integrated. There’s many people today driving their kids to soccer practice and/or black and white and Hispanic in the same car as there have been any time in the past, what really is a threat to the suburbs and their safety is his failure to deal with COVID. They’re dying in the suburbs. His failure to deal with the environment, they’re being flooded, they’re being burned out because his refusal to do anything. That’s why the suburbs are in trouble. I do want to talk about this issue of law and order though. And in the joint recommendation that came from the Biden-Bernie Sanders task force, you talked about quote re-imagining policing. Look, what I support are the police having the opportunity to deal with the problems they face and I’m totally opposed to defunding the police offices. As a matter of fact police, local police, the only one defunding in his budget calls for a $400 million cut in local law enforcement assistance. They need more assistance. They need when they show up for a 9-11 call to have someone with them as a psychologist or psychiatrist to keep them from having to use force and be able to talk people down. We have to have community policing like we had before where the officers get to know the people in the communities. That’s when crime went down, it didn’t go up. It went down. And so we have to be… President Donald J. That’s not what they are talking about this. That’s not what it is about. He’s talking about defunding the police. That is not true. President Donald J. He doesn’t have any law support. He has no law enforcement. That’s not true. President Donald J. He has almost nothing. Oh, really, who do you have name one group that supports you name one group that came out and supported you. Go ahead. Think we have time. We don’t have time to do anything. President Donald J. No, no think right now. Name one law enforcement group that came out in support of you. Now, gentleman. I think I’m going to tell I’m going to take back the bottom line. President Donald J. There aren’t any. And I want to get to another subject, which is the issue of protests in many cities that have turned violent in Portland, Oregon, especially we had more than a 100 straight days of protests, which I think you would agree, you talk about peaceful protests. Many of those turned into riots. Mr. Vice-president you say that people who commit crimes should be held accountable. The question I have though is as the democratic nominee, and earlier tonight, you said that you are the Democratic Party right now, have you ever called the Democratic Mayor of Portland or the Democratic Governor of Oregon and said, “Hey, you got to stop this, bring in the National Guard, do whatever it takes, but you’d stop the days and months of violence in Portland. I don’t hold public office. Now I am a former vice president. I’ve made it clear. I’ve made it clear in my public statements that the violence should be prosecuted. It should be prosecuted and anyone who committed it should be prosecuted. But you’ve never called for the people… President Donald J. He’s never done that. Excuse me, sir. You had never called for the leaders in Portland and in Oregon to call and bring in the National Guard and knock off a 100 days of riots. They can in fact take care of it if he just stay out of the way. President Donald J. Oh really? I sent in the US Marshalls to get the killer of a young man in the middle of the street and they shot him for three days Portland didn’t do anything. I sent in the US Marshals they took care of business. Go ahead sir. And by the way his own former spokesperson said, “Riots and chaos and violence help he cause.” That’s what this is all about. President Donald J. I don’t know who said that. I do. President Donald J. I think Kellyanne Conway. President Donald J. I don’t think she said that. She said that. President Donald J. I don’t think so. Here’s the point, the point is that that’s why he keeps trying to rile everything up. He doesn’t want to calm things down instead of going in and talking to people and saying, “Let’s get everybody together. Figure out how to deal with this.” What’s he do? He just pours gasoline in the fire constantly and every single solitary time. Okay. And to end this, button up this segment I’m going to give you a minute to answer, sir. You have repeatedly criticized… President Donald J. Does it mean I have to answer his stuff. You have repeatedly… President Donald J. Wait a second, you have made a statement. You’ve been talking back and forth. I’m asking you. President Donald J. I would love to end it. You know sir if you want to switch seats we could very quickly can do that. President Donald J. I’ll send in the National Guard, it would be over. That’d be no problem. But I don’t want to accept the National Guard. You have repeatedly criticized the vice president for not specifically calling out Antifa and other left wing extremist groups. But are you willing tonight to condemn white supremacists and militia group and to say that they need to stand down and not add to the violence in a number of these cities as we saw in Kenosha and as we’ve seen in Portland. President Donald J. Sure, I’m will to do that. Are you prepared specifically to do it. President Donald J. I would say almost everything I see is from the left wing not from the right wing. But what are you saying? President Donald J. I’m willing to do anything. I want to see peace. Well, do it, sir. Say it, do it say it. President Donald J. What do you want to call them? Give me a name, give me a name, go ahead who do you want me to condemn. White supremacist and right-wing militia. Proud Boys. President Donald J. Proud Boys, stand back and stand by. His own FBI Director said unlike white supremacist, Antifa is an idea not an organization- President Donald J. Oh you got to be kidding me. … not a militia. That’s what his FBI Director said. President Donald J. Well, then you know what, he’s wrong. We’re done, sir. Moving onto the next… [crosstalk 00:42:46] President Donald J. Antifa is bad. Every body in your administration tells you the truth, it’s a bad idea. You have no idea about anything. President Donald J. You know what, Antifa is a dangerous radical group. All right, gentlemen we’re now moving onto the Trump-Biden record. President Donald J. And you ought to be careful of them, they’ll over throw you. I’m going to ask a question. When the president seeks a second term, it is generally a referendum on his record but vice president Biden, you’d like to quote one of your dad’s sayings, which is don’t compare me to the almighty, compare me to the alternative. And in this case sir you are the alternative. Looking at both of your records, I’m going to ask each of you. Why should voters elect you president over your opponent in this segment, President Trump you’ll go first, two minutes. President Donald J. Because there is never been an administration or president who has done more than I’ve done in a period of three and a half years. And that’s despite the impeachment hoax and you so what happened today with Hillary Clinton, where it was a whole big con job. But despite going through all of these things where I had a fight, both flanks and behind me and above there has never been an administration that’s done what I’ve done. The greatest, before COVID came in the greatest economy in history, lowest unemployment numbers, everything was good. Everything was going. President Donald J. And by the way, there was unity going to happen. People were calling me for the first time in years, they were calling and they were saying it’s time maybe and then what happened? We got hit. But now we’re building it back up again. A rebuilding of the military, including Space Force and all of the other things. A fixing of the VA which was a mess under him, 308,000 people died because they didn’t have proper health care. It was a mess. And we now got a 91% approval rating at the VA, our vets. We take care of our vets. But we’ve rebuilt our military. And I’ll tell you something, some people say maybe the most important by the end of the first term I’ll have approximately 300 Federal judges and Court of Appeals judges, 300 and hopefully three great Supreme Court judges, justices that is a record the likes of which very few people and one of the reasons I’ll have so many judges because President Obama and him left me 128 judges to fill. President Donald J. When you leave office, you don’t leave any judges. That’s like, you just don’t do that. They left 128 openings and if I were a member of his party, because they have a little different philosophy, I’d say, if you left us 128 openings you can’t be a good president. You can’t be a good vice president but I want to thank you because it gives us almost, it’ll probably be above that number. By the end of this term, 300 judges. It’s a record. Looking at both of your records. Why should voters elect you President as opposed to president Trump, you have two minutes uninterrupted. Under this president, we become weaker, sicker, poor, more divided and more violent. When I was vice president, we inherited a recession. I was asked to fix it. I did. We left him a booming economy and he caused the recession. With regard to being weaker, the fact is that I’ve gone head to head with Putin and made it clear to him we’re not going to take any of his stuff. He’s Putin’s puppy. He still refuses to even say anything to Putin about the bounty on the heads of American soldiers. President Donald J. You son got three and a half million dollars. Wait a minute. Mr. President, your campaign agreed to both sides would get two minute answers, uninterrupted. Well, you’re a side agreed to it and why don’t you observe what your campaign agreed to as a ground rule. He never keeps his word. No, that was a rhetorical question. Yes. You may have, go ahead. So thirdly, we’re poor. The billionaires have gotten much more wealthy by a tune of over $3- $400 billion more just since COVID. You in the home, you got less you’re in more trouble than you were before. In terms of being more violent. When we were in office there were 15% less violence in America than there is today. He’s President United States. It’s on his watch. And with regard to more divided the nation, it can’t stay divided. We can’t be this way. And speaking of my son, the way you talk about the military, the way you talk about them being losers and being and just being suckers. My son was in Iraq. He spent a year there. He got the Brown Star. He got the Conspicuous Service Medal. He was not a loser. He was a Patriot and the people left behind there were heroes. President Donald J. And I resent- President Donald J. Are you talking Hunter, are you talking about Hunter. I’m talking about my son, Beau Biden, you’re talking about Hunter? President Donald J. I don’t know Beau. I know Hunter. Hunter got thrown out of the military. He was thrown out dishonorably discharged. That’s not true he was not dishonorably discharged. President Donald J. For cocaine use. And he didn’t have a job until you became vice president. None of that is true. President Donald J. Once you became vice president he made a fortune in Ukraine, in China, in Moscow and various other places. That is not true. President Donald J. He made a fortune and he didn’t have a job. My son like a lot of people at home had a drug problem. He’s overtaking it. He’s fixed it. He’s worked on it. And I’m proud of him, I’m proud of my son. President Donald J. He wasn’t given tens of millions of dollars. [crosstalk 00:48:23] It was all discredited. We’ve already been through this. I think the American people would rather hear about more substantial subjects. Well, as the moderator, sir, I’m going to make a judgment call here. President Donald J. I know but when somebody gets three and a half million dollars from the Mayor of Moscow. That is not true. That report is totally discredited. President Donald J. Mitt Romney on that committee said it wasn’t worth taxpayer’s money. That report was written for political reason. I’d like to talk about climate change. So would I. Okay. The forest fires in the West are raging now. They have burned millions of acres. They have displaced hundreds of thousands of people. When state officials there blamed the fires on climate change. Mr. President, you said, I don’t think the science knows. Over your four years, you have pulled the US out of the Paris Climate Accord. You have rolled back a number of Obama Environmental records, what do you believe about the science of climate change and what will you do in the next four years to confront it? President Donald J. I want crystal clean water and air. I want beautiful clean air. We have now the lowest carbon… If you look at our numbers right now, we are doing phenomenally. But I haven’t destroyed our businesses. Our businesses aren’t put out of commission. If you look at the Paris Accord, it was a disaster from our standpoint. And people are actually very happy about what’s going on because our businesses are doing well. As far as the fires are concerned, you need forest management. In addition to everything else, the forest floors are loaded up with trees, dead trees that are years old and they’re like tinder and leaves and everything else. You drop a cigarette in there the whole forest burns down. You’ve got to have forest management. What do you believe about the science of climate change, sir? President Donald J. I believe that we have to do everything we can to have immaculate air immaculate water and do whatever else we can that’s good. We’re planting a billion trees, the Billion Tree Project and it’s very exciting for a lot of people. You believe that human pollution, gas, greenhouse gas emissions contributes to the global warming of this planet. President Donald J. I think a lot of things do, but I think to an extent, yes. I think to an extent, yes, but I also think we have to do better management of our forest. Every year I get the call. California’s burning, California’s burning. If that was cleaned, if that were, if you had forest management, good forest management, you wouldn’t be getting those calls. In Europe, they live they’re forest cities. They call forest cities. They maintain their forest. They manage their forest. I was with the head of a major country, it’s a forest city. He said, “Sir, we have trees that are far more, they ignite much easier than California. There shouldn’t be that problem.” I spoke with the Governor about it. I’m getting along very well with the governor. But I said, “At some point you can’t every year have hundreds of thousands of acres of land just burned to the ground.” That’s burning down because of a lack of management. But sir if you believe in the science of climate change, why have you rolled back the Obama Clean Power Plan which limited carbon emissions and power plants? Why have you relaxed…? President Donald J. Because it was driving energy prices through the sky. Why have you relaxed fuel economy standards that are going to create more pollution from cars and trucks? President Donald J. Well, not really because what’s happening is the car is much less expensive and it’s a much safer car and you talk it about a tiny difference. And then what would happen because of the cost of the car you would have at least double and triple the number of cars purchased. We have the old slugs out there that are 10, 12 years old. If you did that, the car would be safer. It would be much cheaper by $3,500. But in the case of California they have simply ignored that. President Donald J. No, but you would take a lot of cars off the market because people would be able to afford a car. Now, by the way, we’re going to see how that turns out. But a lot of people agree with me, many people. The car has gotten so expensive because they have computers all over the place for an extra little bit of gasoline. And I’m okay with electric cars too. I think I’m all for electric cars. I’ve given big incentives for electric cars but what they’ve done in California is just crazy. All right, Vice president Biden. I’d like you to respond to the president’s climate change record but I also want to ask you about a concern. You propose $2 trillion in green jobs. You talk about new limits, not abolishing, but new limits on fracking. Ending the use of fossil fuels to generate electricity by 2035 and zero none admission of greenhouse gases by 2050. The president says a lot of these things would tank the economy and cost millions of jobs. He’s absolutely wrong, number one. Number two, if in fact, during our administration in the recovery act, I was in charge able to bring down the cost of renewable energy to cheaper than are as cheap as coal and gas and oil. Nobody’s going to build another coal fired plant in America. No one’s going to build another oil fire plant in America. They’re going to move to renewable energy. Number one, number two, we’re going to make sure that we are able to take the federal fleet and turn it into a fleet that’s run on their electric vehicles. Making sure that we can do that, we’re going to put 500,000 charging stations in all of the highways that we’re going to be building in the future. We’re going to build a economy that in fact is going to provide for the ability of us to take 4 million buildings and make sure that they in fact are weatherized in a way that in fact will they’ll emit significantly less gas and oil because the heat will not be going out. Gas and oil because the heat will not be going out. There’s so many things that we can do now to create thousands and thousands of jobs. We can get to net zero, in terms of energy production, by 2035. Not only not costing people jobs, creating jobs, creating millions of good-paying jobs. Not 15 bucks an hour, but prevailing wage, by having a new infrastructure that in fact, is green. And the first thing I will do, I will rejoin the Paris Accord. I will join the Paris Accord because with us out of it, look what’s happening. It’s all falling apart. And talk about someone who has no relationship with foreign policy. The rainforests of Brazil are being torn down, are being ripped down. More carbon is absorbed in that rainforest than every bit of carbon that’s emitted in the United States. Instead of doing something about that, I would be gathering up and making sure we had the countries of the world coming up with $20 billion, and say, “Here’s $20 billion. Stop tearing down the forest. And If you don’t, then you’re going to have significant economic consequences. What about the argument that President Trump basically says, that you have to balance environmental interests and economic interests? And he’s drawn his line. Well, he hasn’t drawn a line. He wants to make sure that methane’s not a problem. You can now emit more methane without it being a problem. Methane. This is a guy who says that you don’t have to have mileage standards for automobiles that exist now. This is the guy who says that, the fact that- President Donald J. Not true. It’s all true. And here’s the deal- President Donald J. He’s talking about the Green New Deal. And it’s not 2 billion [crosstalk 00:55:45] or 20 billion, as you said [crosstalk 00:55:46]. It’s $100 trillion. Let him go for a minute, and then you can go. President Donald J. And rebuild the building. No. President Donald J. That is not- President Donald J. Not true- President Donald J. … where they want to take out the cows too. Not true. President Donald J. Not true. President Donald J. Simply… Look- President Donald J. All right. Let me [crosstalk 00:02:12]. Wait a minute, sir. I actually have studied your plan, and it includes upgrading 4 million buildings, weatherizing 2 million homes over four years, building one and a half million energy efficient homes. So the question becomes, the president is saying, I think some people who support the president would say, that sounds like it’s going to cost a lot of money and hurt the economy. What it’s going to do, it’s going to create thousands and millions of jobs. Good paying jobs [crosstalk 00:02:41]. Let him finish, sir. He doesn’t know how to do that- President Donald J. 100 million dollars. The fact is, it’s going to create millions of good paying jobs, and these tax incentives for people to weatherize, which he wants to get rid of. It’s going to make the economy much safer. Look how much we’re paying now to deal with the hurricanes, deal with… By the way, he has an answer for hurricanes. He said, maybe we should drop a nuclear weapon on them, and they may- President Donald J. Yeah, he did say that- President Donald J. They made it up. And here’s the deal- President Donald J. … we’re going to be in a position where we can create hard, hard, good jobs by making sure the environment is clean, and we all are in better shape. We spend billions of dollars now, billions of dollars, on floods, hurricanes, rising seas. We’re in real trouble. Look what’s happened just in the Midwest with these storms that come through and wipe out entire sections and counties in Iowa. They didn’t happen before. They’re because of global warming. We make up 15% of the world’s problem. But the rest of the world, we’ve got to get them to come along. That’s why we have to get back into the Paris Accord. All right, gentlemen- President Donald J. Wait a minute, Chris. For 47- President Donald J. So why didn’t you get the world… China sends up real dirt into the air. Russia does. India does. They all do. We’re supposed to be good. And by the way, he made a couple of statements. The Green New Deal is a hundred trillion dollars. That is not my plan [crosstalk 00:58:10]. The Green New Deal [crosstalk 00:58:14] is not my plan. Gentlemen- President Donald J. He made a statement about the military. He said I said something about the military. He and his friends made it up, and then they went with it. I never said it. Okay. [crosstalk 00:58:24] Mr. Vice President- President Donald J. He called the military stupid bastards. I did not say that- President Donald J. He said it on tape. Please, sir. [crosstalk 00:58:33] Stop. President Donald J. Play it. Stop. Go ahead- President Donald J. Mr. Vice President answered his final question. The final question is, I can’t remember which of all his rantings [crosstalk 00:04:44]. Yeah. And about the economy and about this question of what it’s going to cost. The Green New Deal will pay for itself as we move forward. No, I don’t support the Green New Deal. President Donald J. Oh, you don’t? Oh, well, that’s a big statement. I support [crosstalk 00:05:13]- President Donald J. You just lost the radical left. I support [crosstalk 00:59:17] the Biden plan that I put forward. Okay. The Biden plan, which is different than what he calls the radical Green New Deal. All right, gentlemen, final segment, election integrity. As we meet tonight, millions of Americans are receiving mail-in ballots or going to vote early. How confident should we be that this will be a fair election, and what are you prepared to do over the next five plus weeks? Because it will not only be to election day, but also counting some mail-in ballots after election day. What are you prepared to do to reassure the American people that the next president will be the legitimate winner of this election. In this final segment, Mr. Vice President, you go first. Prepare to let people vote. They should go to iwillvote.com, decide how they’re going to vote, when they’re going to vote, and what means by which they’re going to vote. His own Homeland Security director, and as well as the FBI director, says that there is no evidence at all that mail-in ballots are a source of being manipulated and cheating. They said that. The fact is that there are going to be millions of people because of COVID that are going to be voting by mail-in ballots like he does, by the way. He sits behind the Resolute Desk and sends his ballot to Florida, number one. Number two, we’re going to make sure that those people who want to vote in person are able to vote because there are enough poll watchers are there to make sure they can socially distance. The polls are open on time, and the polls stay open until the votes are counted. And this is all about trying to dissuade people from voting because he’s trying to scare people into thinking that it’s not going to be legitimate. Show up and vote. You will determine the outcome of this election. Vote, vote, vote. If you’re able to vote early in your state, vote early. If you’re able to vote in person, vote in person. Vote whatever way is the best way for you, because you will… He cannot stop you from being able to determine the outcome of this election. And in terms of whether or not… When the votes are counted and they’re all counted, that will be accepted. If I win, that will be accepted. If I lose, that’ll be accepted. But by the way, if in fact he says, he’s not sure what he’s going to accept. Well, let me tell you something, it doesn’t matter, because if we get the votes, it’s going to be all over. He’s going to go. He can’t stay in power. It won’t happen. It won’t happen, so vote. Just make sure you understand, you have it in your control to determine what this country is going to look like the next four years. Mr. President, two minutes. President Donald J. So when I listen to Joe talking about a transition, there has been no transition from when I won. I won that election. And if you look at crooked Hillary Clinton, if you look at all of the different people, there was no transition, because they came after me trying to do a coup. They came after me spying on my campaign. They started from the day I won, and even before I won. From the day I came down the escalator with our first lady, they were a disaster. They were a disgrace to our country, and we’ve caught them. We’ve caught them all. We’ve got it all on tape. We’ve caught them all. And by the way, you gave the idea for the Logan Act against General Flynn. You better take a look at that, because we caught you in a sense, and President Obama was sitting in the office. President Donald J. He knew about it too. So don’t tell me about a free transition. As far as the ballots are concerned, it’s a disaster. A solicited ballot, okay, solicited, is okay. You’re soliciting. You’re asking. They send it back. You send it back. I did that. If you have an unsolicited… They’re sending millions of ballots all over the country. There’s fraud. They found them in creeks. They found some, just happened to have the name Trump just the other day in a wastepaper basket. They’re being sent all over the place. They sent two in a Democrat area. They sent out a thousand ballots. Everybody got two ballots. This is going to be a fraud like you’ve never seen. The other thing, it’s nice. On November 3rd, you’re watching, and you see who won the election. And I think we’re going to do well because people are really happy with the job we’ve done. President Donald J. But you know what? We won’t know. We might not know for months because these ballots are going to be all over. Take a look at what happened in Manhattan. Take a look at what happened in New Jersey. Take a look at what happened in Virginia and other places. They’re not losing 2%, 1%, which by the way is too much. An election could be won or lost with that. They’re losing 30 and 40%. It’s a fraud, and it’s a shame. And can you imagine where they say, “You have to have your ballot in by November 10th.” November 10th. That’s seven days after the election, in theory, should have been announced. Sir. President Donald J. Two minutes is two minutes. President Donald J. All run by Democrats. President Trump- President Donald J. It’s a rigged election. You’re going to be able to continue. You have been charging for months that mail-in balloting is going to be a disaster. You say it’s rigged [crosstalk 00:01:04:11], that it’s going to lead to fraud. But in 2018, in the last midterm election, 31 million people voted mail-in voting. That was more than a quarter of all the voters that year, cast their ballots by mail. Now that millions of mail-in ballots have gone out, what are you going to do about it? And are you counting on the Supreme Court, including a Justice Barrett, to settle any dispute? President Donald J. Yeah. I think I’m counting on them to look at the ballots, definitely. I hope we don’t need them, in terms of the election itself. But for the ballots, I think so, because what’s happening is incredible. I read today where at least 1% of the ballots for 2016 were invalidated. They take them. We don’t like them. We don’t like them. But what are you going to do about it- President Donald J. … left and right. There are millions of ballots going out right now. What are you going to do- President Donald J. What you do is you go and vote. No. No. I know your complaint [crosstalk 01:05:05]. I’m asking you about the fact that millions of people have received- President Donald J. You go and vote. No. But what I’m saying is [crosstalk 01:05:11], what are you going to do about the fact that millions of people- President Donald J. You either do, Chris, a solicited ballot, where you’re sending it in, they’re sending it back and you’re sending. They have mailmen with lots of it. Did you see what’s going on? Take a look at West Virginia, mailman selling the ballots. They’re being sold. They’re being dumped in rivers. This is a horrible thing for our country. There is no [crosstalk 01:05:32]… There is no evidence of that- President Donald J. This is not going to end well. There is no evidence of that- President Donald J. Okay. Five states have had mail-in ballots for the last decade or more. Five, including two Republican states. And you don’t have to solicit the ballot. It’s sent to you. It’s sent to your home. What they’re saying is that it has to be a postmark by election day. If it doesn’t get in until the seventh, eighth, ninth, it still should be counted. He’s just afraid of counting the votes- President Donald J. You’re wrong. You’re wrong [crosstalk 01:06:04]. I want to continue with you on this [crosstalk 01:06:06] Vice President Biden- President Donald J. No. Excuse me. Vice President Biden, the biggest problem, in fact, over the years with mail-in voting has not been fraud, historically. It has been that sizable numbers, sometimes hundreds of thousands of ballots are thrown out because they have not been properly filled out, or there is some other irregularity, or they missed [crosstalk 01:06:28] the deadline. I am concerned that any court would settle this, because here’s the deal. When you get a ballot and you fill it out, you’re supposed to have an affidavit. If you didn’t know, you have someone say that, this is me. You should be able to, if in fact you can verify that’s you before the ballot is thrown out, that’s sufficient to be able to count the ballot because someone made a mistake and not dotting the correct I. Who they voted for, testify, say who they voted for, say it’s you. That is totally legitimate. All right. President Donald J. No. No. No. I have a final [crosstalk 00:13:12]. Gentlemen, I have a final question [crosstalk 01:07:14]- President Donald J. You know it can’t be done. We can keep talking. In eight states, [crosstalk 01:07:27] election workers are prohibited, currently by law, eight states, from even beginning to process ballots, even take them out of the envelopes and flatten them until election day. That means that it’s likely, because there’s going to be a huge increase in mail-in balloting, that we are not going to know on election night who the winner is, that it could be days. It could be weeks- President Donald J. … until we find out who the new president is. First for you, sir. Finally, for the vice president, and I hope neither of you will interrupt the other. Will you urge your supporters to stay calm during this extended period, not to engage in any civil unrest? And will you pledge tonight that you will not declare victory until the election has been independently certified? President Trump, you go first- President Donald J. I’m urging my supporters to go in to the polls and watch very carefully, because that’s what has to happen. I am urging them to do it. As you know, today there was a big problem. In Philadelphia, they went in to watch. They’re called poll watchers, a very safe, very nice thing. They were thrown out. They weren’t allowed to watch. You know why? Because bad things happen in Philadelphia. Bad things. And I am urging my people. I hope it’s going to be a fair election. You’re urging them what? President Donald J. … I am 100% on board. But if I see tens of thousands of ballots being manipulated, I can’t go along with that. What does that mean, not go along- President Donald J. Does that mean you’re going to tell your people- President Donald J. … to take to the streets? President Donald J. It means you have a fraudulent election. And what would you do about that? President Donald J. They’re not equipped… These people aren’t equipped to handle it, number one. Number two, they cheat. They cheat. Hey, they found ballots in a wastepaper basket three days ago, and they all had the name military ballots. There were military. They all had the name Trump on them. Vice President Biden- President Donald J. Vice President Biden, final question for you. Yes. And here’s the deal. We count the ballots, as you pointed out. Some of these ballots in some states can’t even be opened until election day. And if there’s thousands of ballots, it’s going to take time to do it. And by the way, our military… They’ve been voting by ballots since the end of the Civil War, in effect. And that’s what’s going to happen. Why is it, for them, somehow not fraudulent. It’s the same process. It’s honest. No one has established at all that there is fraud related to mail-in ballots, that somehow it’s a fraudulent process. President Donald J. It’s already been established. I asked you. You had an opportunity to respond [crosstalk 01:10:13]. Go ahead [crosstalk 01:10:14]. Vice President Biden, go ahead. He has no idea what he’s talking about. Here’s the deal. The fact is, I will accept it, and he will too. You know why? Because once the winner is declared after all the ballots are counted, all the votes are counted, that’ll be the end of it. That’ll be the end of it. And if it’s me, in fact, fine. If it’s not me, I’ll support the outcome. And I’ll be a president, not just for the Democrats. I’ll be a president for Democrats and Republicans. And this guy- President Donald J. Gentlemen, just say that’s the end of it [crosstalk 01:10:45]. This is the end of this debate- President Donald J. I want to see an honest ballot count. We’re going to leave it there- President Donald J. … to be continued in more debates as we go on. President Trump, Vice President Biden, it’s been an interesting hour and a half. I want to thank you both for participating in the first of three debates that you have agreed to engage in. We want to thank Case Western Reserve University and the Cleveland Clinic for hosting this event. The next debate, sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates, will be one week from tomorrow, October 7th, at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. The two vice presidential nominees, Vice President Mike Pence and Senator Kamala Harris will debate at 9:00 PM Eastern that night. We hope you watch. Until then, thank you, and good night. Thank you."
"113","09-30-20"," Please welcome the Reverend Dr. Good morning. This is going to be something of a litany in which there will be an opportunity for all of you to respond if you choose to. If prayer is within your spirit, then I will give you the signal to pray with these words we pray to you, oh God. But I will signal when it is time to do that. Let us pray. Gracious and eternal God. Sovereign Lord, over all the earth, we acknowledge that you are the author and the architect of the whole of creation. You are the source of life and goodness for all the nations that dwell on the planet. You, oh God gave shape to the mountains, depths to the oceans, flight to the birds, fragrance to the flowers and warmth to the sun. Every good and perfect gift comes from you. And we honor you this morning with our prayer of thanksgiving. We also come before you with our prayer of petition. We know that you are not defined by the partisan politics of a single nation, but we hope and pray that you will hear and heed our requests today. We pray today for Joseph Biden, Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, because we believe that they are best suited to lead and guide our nation in ways that are important to us and consistent with your designs for the world. We pray, oh God, that they will lead us in ways that make us better stewards of the creation in which, and upon which we all depend. Save us from people and policies, so driven by greed and short-term gain that they have no regard for clean air, clean water, the land rights of the indigenous people, the financial strains of small farmers, black and white, or the changing climate that is fueling fierce fires, howling hurricanes and shrinking species. And now I invite you to say, “We pray to you, oh God.” We pray for these two candidates amid a global health pandemic that is consuming lives, livelihoods, and life savings across the country and around the world. So give to them, oh God, the wisdom to lead our nation in ways that seem to have escaped those who are currently holding the reins of power in this country. We’ve witnessed more than 205,000 dead, more than 7 million infected, more than 16 million unemployed, just in this country. And the virus is not through with us yet. At this critical hour, we need leadership marked by courage in the face of the problem and compassion in response to the suffering. And so we say, we pray to you, oh God. Our nation has a tragic history of racial and ethnic oppression that has recently overflowed to the streets of our cities and towns. In memory of those who have been lynched, shot, beaten, burned out, or forced to leave their ancestral lands along a trail of tears. We pray for leaders that will serve we, the people, all the people, all races, all income groups, all regions, all religions, who long for the promise of life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness. We pray to you, oh God. We pray for our fragile democracy. We pray for the continuation of a government of the people and by the people and for the people. There are forces at work today that are endangering this American experiment. The nation needs new leaders that will preserve that principle by honoring the outcome of elections, by disavowing foreign interference in our electoral process, by paying their taxes and by safeguarding the right of every American to participate in free and fair elections. And so we say, we pray to you, oh God. Finally, we pray for the candidates themselves. We pray for their stamina, as they endure the rigors of a national campaign. We pray for their spirits, as their character and their competence are regularly and relentlessly attacked. We pray for their clarity of purpose, always reminding them that this electoral process is about we, the people, and not just an opportunity to advance their own egos and agendas as some have done in recent years. We pray for their families. we pray for their spouses. We pray for their children and their siblings. And if these candidates are blessed to win the selection, then keep them and their families as they take on the enormous burden of governing our nation and helping to safeguard our world. And we close, oh God with two hymns. Our fathers God to the author of liberty. To thee, we sing long may our land be bright with freedom’s holy light, protect us by thy might, great God, our King. And God of our weary years, God of our silent tears, thou who has brought us thus far on the way. Thou who has by thy might let us into the light, keep us forever in the path, we pray. Lest our feet stray from the places, our God, where we met thee. Lest our hearts, drunk with a wine of the world forget thee. Shadowed beneath thy hand, may we forever stand true to our God, true to our native land. We pray to you, oh God. Amen. Please welcome, jill Biden. Dr. Good morning. Thank you, Reverend Dr. McMickle. That was beautiful. Thank you so much. You know, with everything that’s going on, faith has never felt more important, in our spiritual beliefs, in our communities, and in the potential of our nation. You remind us of all three, so thank you for your beautiful words today and for joining us. So hello, Cleveland, and didn’t Joe do a great job last night? I thought he was so strong, and he looked so presidential. Thank you. Thank you. Dr. Over these last few months, I’ve been talking to communities about school reopenings, and a few weeks ago, I spoke to a public school counselor who told me something that really I won’t forget. She said, “The two most important roles in my life are being a school counselor and being a mom.” And right now, I feel like I’m failing at both. As a parent, I want to have all the answers for my kids, but over these last four years, so many parents have told me that they have more questions than answers. Like, “How do I keep my family safe from this pandemic?” “What if a shooting happens at our school?” “What if I lose my job?” And, “How do I tell my kids to be kind when our leaders don’t live up to that same standard?” And not just parents, all of us feel it. The chaos of this moment, the magnitude of the loss that surrounds us, and the acrimony that we see way too often. Dr. There are those who want to us to believe that our nation is hopelessly divided, that our differences are irreconcilable, that our communities are fractured beyond repair. And beneath that is another message. “Your voice can’t fix it.” “Your vote won’t change it.” Oh, how about this one? “It is what it is.” But that’s not who we are. Is it, Ohio? Just look at what we’ve seen over these last few months. We’re coming together and we’re holding onto one another. We’re finding mercy and grace in the moments that we might have once taken for granted. We’re seeing that our differences are precious and that our similarities are infinite. Democrat and Republican, rural and urban, our communities are showing that the heart of this nation still beats with kindness and courage. Dr. We don’t agree on everything, and we know that we don’t have to. We can still love and respect each other. We care more about people than politics, and we know that we are not fractured. We’re not broken. We’re because coming something new. We just need steady leadership to help us heal and move us forward. And that’s my husband, Joe Biden. He will be a president for all Americans, and he has a plan for all Americans. He and Kamala have the fortitude to lead us out of Donald Trump’s chaotic America. They have the character to help us heal and the vision to help us rebuild for a future that is better than ever. But they can’t do it without you, because this is it. There are no do-overs. We can’t sit back and just watch what happens. We have to decide what happens. Dr. Cynics play to our fears. They tell us that we can’t make a difference because they don’t want us to try. They know that together, our voices are more powerful than they ever could be, and we have to show them our power. We have to believe that our communities are stronger than the challenge we face, because they are. We have to believe that our votes matter, because they do. We have to show up right now, put our shoulders back, and work like we’ve never worked before. So will you join us? Will you prove the cynics wrong? Will you help show that our nation will never settle for less than our highest aspirations? Will you stand with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris? Because Ohio, when you do, we know that we will win. Dr. So I want to end by saying thank you. Thank you for all that all of you do for your communities. Thank you for showing up right now when it matters. And thank you for your faith in an idea that’s bigger than any one of us, and that is that we will, we will build a better nation, because we are going to do this together. So thank you, Ohio. Thank you. Thank you, Ohio. Dr. And now it is my pleasure to invite a fellow educator to the stage. One of the millions of teachers across this country who are working overtime and rising to the moment to make sure our students can learn no matter what. So I’d like you to meet Tiffany Davis. Thank you so much, Dr. Biden, for that introduction. It’s an honor to be introduced by you, especially as a fellow educator. Good morning, everyone. My name is Tiffany Davis, and I’m a fifth grade teacher at Lordstown Elementary School in Lordstown, Ohio. Like Joe and Jill Biden, we’re a union strong household, and we’re fighters. My husband, Tom, is a proud member of the United Auto Workers, and I’m an Ohio Federation of Teachers member. In the Valley, we’re tough. We’re resilient. We keep building, but President Trump’s failure to protect American manufacturing jobs in Lordstown has torn us apart. Families have been separated and uprooted from the community we know and love. My husband, Tom, worked the assembly line at the General Motors Lordstown plant for 17 years before the plant closed its doors last March. As a family, we made the agonizing decision for Tom to accept a transfer to the GM plant in Bowling Green, Kentucky, so he could retain his job and pension benefits, and so our family could maintain our health care coverage. Bowling Green, Kentucky, is eight hours away, and my husband makes this drive every single weekend to see me and our two children, Aubrey and Brian, who are just seven and 12 years old. They miss their dad, and I miss my husband, and it didn’t have to be this way. In 2017, Donald Trump campaigned in Youngstown, just down the road from us. He told us not to sell our homes, promising to keep plants like Lordstown open, and to save Ohio manufacturing jobs. … open, and to save Ohio manufacturing jobs. Less than two years later, he didn’t lift a finger as Lordstown closed its doors, and more than 5,400 jobs were lost. Our story is not unique. Our friends and family are now scattered throughout the country, either working at other General Motors facilities or continuing to look for work. Five of my own students had to move from Lordstown as a result of the plant closure. We know the truth. Our community was left behind by Donald Trump and his broken promises. Joe Biden will never leave us behind because no one has more respect for the working women and men who get up every day to build this country than he does. Joe knows Scranton is a lot like the Valley. He’s got a plan to build our economy back better for working families, just like mine. Joe will mobilize the talent, grit, and innovation of Ohioans to ensure the future is made in all of America, by all of Americans. The Valley needs fighters like Joe and Jill Biden in the White House for us. And there’s no one tougher than a teacher to fight for our kids like Dr. Jill Biden will do as First Lady. Ohio is ready to build back better. Ohio is ready for Joe Biden. With that, it is my honor to introduce and welcome back to Ohio, the next President of the United States, Joe Biden. Hey everybody. I have to tell y’all, it’s great to see you. Hello Cleveland. Don’t jump. Folks, I was reminiscing as we drove to the station, I spent the bulk of my adult life driving to an Amtrak station. I commuted every day from Wilmington, Delaware to Washington DC when I got elected as a young Senator, right after my wife and daughter were killed, and I didn’t plan on staying in the Senate, but I agreed I’d stay for six months, a long time ago, and I started commuting and the fact is they tell me I’ve logged more than 2,100,000 miles on Amtrak. So it’s good to be here. It’s not as fast as the helicopter, but I made a lot of family and friends on Amtrak. So I’m looking forward to getting on the train with you guys. I want to start off by saying that it’s great to be in Ohio and with my so many friends, members of Congress, local elected officials. It’s an honor to be here with Tiffany. I know how hard it is for her. And I say I know, I was in the position of her children. My dad went through the same thing, Mr. Mayor. Back in Scranton, Pennsylvania, he lost his job. And I remember him walking up the stairs, making what I call that longest walk a parent has to make to tell a child that he’s going to have to leave. My dad didn’t have an eight hour ride. He only had a three hour ride, three and a half hour ride. He moved to Wilmington, Delaware. Took a couple of years before he could bring us back down to Delaware, come home every weekend, but to make sure that we’re all together again. It’s a hard slog. A lot of people have made that. And Tiffany, you’re a wonderful, wonderful mother, teacher, and the way you talk about your husband, he and I have something in common. We both married way up. I want to say that my dad, when he was, I apologize to Congressman Lamb, he’s heard me say this a lot, but my dad, when we moved back to Delaware, moved to Delaware, would say all the time to his children, my siblings and I, he’d say, “Joey, a job’s about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about being able to hold your head up. It’s being able to look your child in the eye and say, it’s going to be okay. That’s what a job is about.” And Tiffany, when I think about your husband taking that job eight hours away, although it’s a hundred years ago, I think about my dad, and I imagine your husband has the same stamina, and you do, as my mom and dad did. The fact is that last night’s debate, and this election, is supposed to be about you, Tiffany, about you and all the people I grew up with in Scranton, and people in Youngstown, and Claymont, Delaware, and all the people who make a difference. Does any President, does your President understand at all what you’re going through, what so many other people are going through? Question is does he see you where you are and where you want to be? Does he care? As he tried to walk in your shoes, to understand what’s going on in your life? Or does he just ignore you and all the folks all over America who are in a similar situation? I think he’s more than ignoring us. I look at things from Scranton’s perspective, he looks at from Park Avenue. I think he basically looks down on us. He judges us. The fact is that I think that when he called our military, and I see we got some veterans here too, thank you for your service man, but when he called our veterans who lost their lives and served suckers and losers, I thought it was one of the most despicable things that I’ve ever heard a President say. Guys you are soldiers or a veteran, you served your country, like you did, like you did Connor, like my son did. What he does, he lies to you. He lies to you about exactly what’s happened. Does he lie to you when, like this president did to your husband, that all the workers at GM plant in Lordstown were going to be in good shape. And you said it to me, he said, “Don’t move. Don’t sell your house because no Ohio factory will shut down in Donald Trump’s America.” He doesn’t pay his fair share, don’t worry about that. He doesn’t pay his fair share in taxes. He says that makes him smart. What does that do? What does that make you, Tiffany, make me, and millions of other hard working Americans, decent people who pay our taxes? Are we the suckers? Are we stupid because we go by the rules? He’s too weak to beat the pandemic. Cost him more than 200,000 American lives. That’s upended every part of our lives and hit working people particularly hard. Your businesses are closed and schools aren’t back to normal because Donald Trump hasn’t done his job. He hasn’t pulled Congress together to provide real relief for working people, moms, and dads, and business owners. The fact is Congress has passed a significant recovery bill, but he’s too busy being in a bunker, or in his golf course to call them into the White House to work out an agreement. He told FEMA to cut off funding for school PPE, masks, and protective gear, because it’s not a national emergency. His response during the deadly pandemic is to try to take your healthcare away by asking the Supreme Court to strike the Affordable Care Act in its entirety. Wipe it out. … the Affordable Care Act in its entirety, wipe it out, taking us back to a time when insurance companies could deny you coverage for preexisting conditions. Now, because of COVID, lung scarring or heart problems is a consequence of having survived COVID. That could be the next pre-existing conditions affecting millions of people. Taking away Medicare benefits for seniors. Throw your adult kids off your healthcare insurance. Think about his plan for your social security. The social security actuary said that if he follows through on his plan for social security, social security will be quote, “Bankrupt by 2023.” It clear that he not only cares about Wall Street and the super wealthy and the Fortune 500, he thinks they built this country. That’s why he wants another $30 billion tax cut for the hundred wealthiest billionaires in the country, who have already made $ 30 billion during this pandemic. So they’ll pay a lower tax rate than you do as a teacher, a factory worker, a firefighter, a nurse. He gave a tax giveaway for corporations and they moved jobs overseas to sell goods back to the United States. Here comes the train that he tried to make sure didn’t continue to run. That’s the commuter. All right. But folks, look, he let big corporation jump in front of the line to get the recovery aid that Congress had passed while small businesses are struggling to say open. In the end, his measure of economic health is the stock market. In four years as president, he’s broken his promise, he’s forgotten the forgotten Americans he said he was always going to fight for. Well, I never will forget. I know the middle class working people built this country and I measure our economic success by what families are talking about around their kitchen tables this morning. Some of them with an empty chair because they lost a family member. The ones I saw every night on my train ride from Washington to Wilmington, Delaware, as I said after my wife and daughter were killed when I was first elected, I started going home every single night so I’d be there in the morning to get my kids, Beau Hunter and Ashley ready for school. Actually, Jill, God love her, she came into our life five years later and made things good. For 36 years, I said, I took that 250 mile round trip journey each day. I’d get to know the train engineers, the conductors, the fellow passengers, and at night, I’d see the pinpoints of lights in the homes in the cities and towns along the way from Washington to Wilmington and wonder what those families are talking about after they put their kids to bed. Folks, this election has a choice between Scranton and Park Avenue values, between Cleveland and Park Avenue values, between Alliance and Park Avenue values. But it’s also about something deeper. Can these parents look their kids in the eye and say, ” Honey, everything’s going to be okay.” These are the conversations I’m going to be having today in this whistle stop tour through Ohio and Pennsylvania, talking to folks about how I’ll get the virus under control, lay out the plan, bringing Congress together to provide relief and resources to schools and business so we can reopen our economy safely and strongly with a real plan and real leadership. Talking to folks about how I’d create good paying jobs, union jobs, to support working families and build our economy back. Not just back, but build it back better. I’ll protect your Medicare and social security and how I’ll fight to protect pensions, including fixing [inaudible 00:31:13] employer pensions so that many union women and men in Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, Delaware, all across this country, are able to keep what they earned and deserve. I’ll fight for American jobs with the dignity of work and make the wealthy and corporations began to pay their fair share. I’ll protect your right to healthcare and build on and improve the Affordable Care Act and I’ll always tell you the truth. I’ll always care about you, whether you vote for me or not. If elected, I’m not going to be a Democratic president, I’m going to be an American president. Whether you voted for me or not, I’m going to be your president and I’ll never forget the people, the working people of this country, because that’s what I’ve come from. That, given just half a chance, the American people can do anything. Just like you, Tiffany, and your husband, you’ve stood up. You can do anything. I want to make something absolutely clear. There’s overwhelming reason for optimism. Reverend, as you said, there’s overwhelming reason. We just have to unite. The country is ready to do that. We’re better positioned than any nation in the world to own the 21st century, we just have to do it and do it together. So I leave you Rev and thank you for your invocation by saying, God bless you all and may God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Keep the faith. We’re coming back. Thank you."
"114","10-02-20"," Everyone please welcome our first speaker and essential worker at a grocery store and a UFCW local 876 member, Matt Hoffman. Thank you, Mr. Vice President for the opportunity to speak about what essential grocery workers, including countless UFCW members like myself are dealing with. My name is Matt Hoffman and I’m a grocery store worker in Imlay City, Michigan, and I have been on the front lines of the pandemics since day one. Working around the clock to help make sure families in my community have the food they need during this crisis. I live in a small town and our community has been devastated by COVID-19 and the damage it has done to our economy. Over these many months, there is not a day that goes by where workers like me are not putting our lives on the line. In the beginning, we had no protective equipment and we were even told we would be sent home without pay if we wore masks or gloves on the job. The health risks we face are real. We interact with the public every day. We are vital to the food supply, but we cannot do our job if we are not protected. Essential workers like us deserve essential precautions like hazard pay. I am here today because we need to build a better America than one we see. We need to create good jobs. We need to make sure employers do the right and pay us for the risks we face. We can’t afford to listen to companies that make billions in profit and then cut hazard pay. We need a leader who puts hardworking men and women and their families first. This is why I’m supporting Joe Biden. Lastly, I would like to urge all my friends and family, regardless of their party to vote for Vice President Biden so we can have a president who prioritizes us in our jobs. From everything I’ve heard you say and the way you clearly care for others, I know you are the leader we need. Thank you again for listening to Michigan workers and welcome Mr. Vice President. Hey folks. Good afternoon. Before I start, let me explain the delay. We wanted to make sure that we’re doing everything by the numbers. And so I got two COVID tests this morning, one in Delaware, and one by the former White House doc who came up and everything’s cleared. We want to make sure everything was clear before I came. We were supposed to have an event after this at a headquarters, but based on the crowd size and an indoor, it was concluded by the docs that best not to do it. But I want to thank all of you. I want to thank Matt. And Matt, you’re dead right. You were putting yourself on the line and a lot of other people did all across this country in your union. And I want to thank David way, Secretary-Treasurer of local 951, for having me here today. Look, I’d like to start by acknowledging which I sure all of you do as well. Sending my prayers for the health and safety of the first lady and president of the United States after they tested positive for COVID-19. My wife, Jill and I pray that they’ll make a quick and full recovery. This is not a matter of politics. It’s a bracing reminder to all of us that we have to take this virus seriously. It’s not going away automatically. We have to do our part to be responsible. It means following the science, listening to the experts, washing our hands, social distancing. It means wearing a mask in public and means encouraging others to do so as well. It means having masking mandates nationwide. The director of the CDC, Center for Disease Control, Dr. Red field said, and I quote, and he held up a mask. He said, “These face masks are the most important, powerful public health tool we have. Then he held the mask up again and said, “This face mask is more guaranteed to protect me against COVID than a vaccine.” Leading scientist from the University of Washington tell us that we can save more than 100,000 American lives in the next 100 days alone if everyone wore a mask in public. So let me repeat that because it’s so important. We can save 100,000 lives in the next 100 days, according to the head of the CDC, if everyone wears a mask in public. So be patriotic. It’s not about being a tough guy. It’s about doing your part. Wearing a mask is not only going to protect you, but it also protects those around you. Your mom, your dad, your brother, your sister, husband, wife, neighbor, coworker. Don’t just do it for yourself, do it for the people you love, the people you work with. The seriousness of this virus also underscores that we need regular testing with results turned around rapidly and that’s available to everyone. It’s not just the folks in the White House or who travel with me that deserved regular testing, it’s folks in the meatpacking and food processing plants, grocery store workers. Every single American deserves safety and peace of mind. And it means we need transparency. Those who test positive need to participate in contact tracing so that everyone who they may have exposed can get tested themselves. That’s how you stop transmission for any epidemic. Is basic. We need to take the science of fighting this disease seriously if we’re going to save lives. And above all the news is a reminder that we, as a nation, need to do better in dealing with this pandemic. Taking these steps is how we’ll protect ourselves. And just as important is how we will protect one another. Hope that all those who are fighting this virus, including the first family and so many Americans today recover and recover soon. My prayers are with the families of the more than 200. I think it’s seven now. 207,000 Americans who’ve died from this virus. Many haven’t got up this morning. The breakfast table with an the empty chair of someone they lost and they loved. We understand. And there’s more than 7 million Americans who are have been infected. That includes folks here in Grand Rapids and all across Michigan, especially all of you or that you have with UFCW who are on the front lines of this pandemic and on the front lines of this economic crisis. UFCW workers who have always been on the front lines of fighting for dignity and respect you deserve. I know it’s been tough. This morning, September jobs report came out. The last one before election day. I’m grateful for all those who were able to get their jobs back to work again, but it was fewer jobs than we had hoped for. Millions of families, millions are still wondering when it will be their turn to come back from the brink. And the signs according to national press are not encouraging. Once again, the pace of job gains is slowing down. Once again, we’re seeing temporary layoffs turn permanent. This month marked the largest single month increase in long-term unemployment since we started keeping records in 1948. There are now an additional 781,000 Americans who have been trying to find work for at least six months. They’ve been looking for work for at least six months and haven’t found it. And in the past, that’s a sign for permanency for them. We’re still down 647,000 manufacturing jobs nationwide since the crisis started. All told, we are now 30 million workers who have either lost hours, lost paychecks or lost their jobs entirely. Participating in labor force participation fell last month and remains sharply down since this crisis began, especially for women. There’s another roughly 700,000 people who have dropped out of the labor force. Stopped looking for a job. The vast majority were women demonstrating once again how this economic crisis has been especially tough on women and families in This country. This will be the first presidency in modern history to leave office with fewer jobs than when it came into office. Michigan has lost more than then 361,000 jobs since the beginning of 2017. In fact, factories were already closing before COVID like the Knoll plant here in Grand Rapids. They announced back in January, they were shutting down and cutting 210 local jobs. Manufacturing has already slipped into recession last year. The net loss of auto manufacturing jobs you saw here in Michigan. And that economic pain was only amplified by the pandemic. Your schools and local businesses are closed like all places around America. More than 26 million unemployment claims were filed by Americans last month. 46 million Americans have exhausted their emergency savings and essential workers here in Grand Rapids won’t forget how the UFCW members saw their jobs turned suddenly into a life and death task. Folks, today’s report reinforces another painful trend. A continuing of what economists call a K-shaped recovery. And K means that letter going up. That’s those who on the top, it keeps going up while everyone else in the middle is going down and below. We’re seeing things get worse. It means essential workers, UFCW workers who sacrificed to keep us going through the pandemic and continuing are being left behind by the most unequal recovery in modern history. Because while workers are struggling, this is a fact, the top 100 billionaires in America have done pretty well. Just the top 100 of them. They’ve made up more than $30 billion this year in the last nine months. And everyone else, though you keep hoping, you get the bottom of that K-shaped recovery. You get the downward slide. You’re left to figure out how you’re going to pay the bills and put food on the table. How to balance doing your job with being a teacher to your kids because their school has gotten remote. You’re asked to risk your neck because you can’t work from home when the risks for COVID are kept outside because you work at a meat packing plant or an assembly line or the checkout counter. I do understand this is a scary time, an uncertain time. I understand it and I see you because I see the world from where I grew up in Scranton, Pennsylvania. A lot like Grand Rapids. It’s filled with an awful lot of good people busting their neck every day, do the right thing for their families. In Scranton my mom used to have an expression. She said not just in Scranton, but from the time we left there. She said, “Joey, nobody’s better than you Joey, but everybody’s your equal.” My dad’s constant refrain after he lost a job in Scranton when there were no more work and he had to move to Delaware. He moved away for a little over a year and come back every weekend to see us. The time we finally, a couple years down the road in Delaware, got to finally be able to buy a home. My dad used to use this expression. He said, “Joey, a job’s about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in the community.” These are the values that shaped my growing up and I suspect most you. It shaped my whole life. So I know and understood from the very beginning of consciousness about this, that Wall Street and CEOs didn’t build this country, the middle-class built this country and unions built the middle class. That’s why I’ve laid out a comprehensive agenda, not just to rebuild our communities, but to make bold investments so we can build back and bill back better. And independent analysis actually from Wall Street, Moody’s, projected that my plan will create 18.6 million jobs. 7 million more than the administration’s economic plan and $1 trillion more in economics growth than the president’s plan. That’s not coming from a liberal think tank, that’s coming from Moody’s. Here’s how my plan works. I’m going to raise taxes on people only making over 400. Anyone making less than $400,000 a year won’t pay a penny more. But I’m going to ask the very big corporations, the Fortune 500 and the wealthy to pay their fair share for a change. That means raising the corporate tax rate, which was in the mid 30s and now is 21% back to 28%. That means making sure that no big company gets away with paying zero taxes as 91 Fortune 500 companies do today making billions of dollars. Zero taxes. How many of you pay zero taxes? Means making sure the wealthiest Americans don’t get to pay at a lower tax rate because they’re making money on their investments, but they pay at the same rate that they pay for their salary. These changes in the tax code will raise the money, it’ll allow me to invest in working people and growing the middle class. Which is when I announced I was running, I said, that’s the reason. To rebuild the backbone of this country. Hardworking folks in the middle class, we’re going to invest in creating millions of good paying jobs, union jobs. By the way, my plan has been thoroughly analyzed by a whole bunch of folks. Take infrastructure, building roads, bridges, highways, ports, airports will put millions of people to work in good paying union jobs and create the foundation for growth in this country. Clean energy. Just upgrading 4 million buildings and weatherizing 2 million homes will create at least 1 million good paying jobs. Leading in the world on electric vehicles and building 500,000 electric charging stations on our highways will create 1 million new auto jobs here in this state. The manufacturing and technology in those areas, making sure the future is made in America, made in Michigan with good union jobs. The federal government spends $600 billion a year of your tax dollars. 600 billion a year to purchase everything from military equipment to steel, to cars, to trucks, to federal fleets at $600 billion. When I’m president, we’re going to make sure we finally make good on a commitment made a long time ago that these products, all these contracts, that the president of United States and the federal government can award, make sure those products are made by Americans in America. Making sure that, that’s done. It’s estimated that we’ll create 5 million new manufacturing jobs and technology jobs. For small businesses, we’re going to make sure small businesses come out on the other side of this terrible circumstance with access to capital and the ability to deal with the debts that have been accumulated during this pandemic. And we’ll make investments to increase incomes as well. $15 minimum wage. No one should be in a position to have to work two jobs just to get above the poverty line. We’re going to bring back jobs from overseas to America and direct billions of dollars in revitalization funds and competitive grants to help communities like those in Western Michigan compete for new business startups. For our essential workers, we’re not just going to praise you, we’re going to pay you a good wage to ensure you have a strong benefits. We’re going to ease the burden of the major cost in your life. Healthcare. We’ll build on the Affordable Care Act through a new health insurance option, a not-for-profit public option which will give private insurers a real competitor. We’ll increase subsidies for your premiums so they’re lower. So you can afford the plans with lower deductions and lower out-of-pocket expenses. That plan alone will cost over $700 billion over 10 years, but it’s paid for by eliminating those tax cuts. For a 40 year old making $50,000 a year, your monthly premium will go down by a third. We’ll take on the pharmaceutical companies with a plan that slashes the cost of prescription drugs for up to 60%. Medicare will be able to negotiate prices for drugs fundamentally lowering those prices. And childcare. A lot of you’re dealing with that now. We’re going to make high quality childcare affordable and accessible. Every three and four year old will have access to free quality preschool. We’re going to make sure that low and middle-income families will never have to pay more than 7% of their income for caring for a young child. In education beyond high school. We’re going to make sure that four year college tuition of a state university is tuition free for any family making less than $125,000. Community college would be free and programs and training will be free as well. If you buying your first home, you’ll have a $15,000 help to get there. These are all things that people have been talking about for a while. We’re going to protect social security, increase the benefits for millions of seniors. The president’s talking about eliminating the withholding tax. Well, that’s wonderful except for one thing, the actuary of social security said if that plan goes through social security will be bankrupt by 2023. Folks, I promise you, we can do this. Let me close by saying this. I know a lot of people around here are tired of feeling overlooked and disrespected. I get that. The people I met this week taking a train through Northeastern, Ohio and Western Pennsylvania. People like the dedicated elementary school teacher from Lordstown, Ohio, whose husband, when Lordstown shut down accepted a transfer to Kentucky eight hours away each direction in order to be able to keep his healthcare and his pension after the GM plant closed. Folks who worry about healthcare. Will the Affordable Care Act still be there for them? Why? Why they ask. Where once again, women will be able to charge a higher premium just simply because they’re a woman. Where insurers no longer have to allow you to be able to keep your kids on a healthcare plan until age 26. What will happen to your Medicare benefits, your social security? Will they still be there when you retire? I’m asked many times in recent years, how do we get to the place where people who stock our shelves, pack our food, teach our kids like my family, take care of my wife, take care of our sick, who race into burning buildings and pick up the garbage off our streets. Who did. How do we get to the place where you all don’t think we see you anymore or hear them and most importantly, respect them? That has to change. I know it can. I come from those neighborhoods. We can get this pandemic under control so we can get our economy working again for everyone. But this cannot be a partisan moment, it must be an American moment. We have to come together as a nation. I’m running as a Democrat, but I will run and govern as an American president. Whether you voted for me or against me, I will represent you. And those who see each other as fellow Americans who just don’t live in red states or blue states, but who live in and love the United States of America. That’s who we are. And there’s never been a single solitary thing America’s been unable to do. Think of this. Not once. Not a single thing we’ve not been able to overcome when we’ve done it together. So let’s get the heck up. Remember who in God’s name we are. This is the United States of America. There’s nothing beyond our capacity. I want to say, God bless you and God protect the first family and every family who’s dealing with this virus and may God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."
"115","10-03-20"," -offs and thousands of others could lose their jobs soon. Race relations are at an all time low. These are the dark days that we have ever experienced. But, there’s a light at the end of the tunnel, a chance to turn things around and get our country back where it belongs. It will happen one month from today on November 3rd when we have a chance to elect a man who has always been with us, a working class guy from Scranton, Pennsylvania, who will restore decency and honesty to the White House. It is my great honor to introduce the next President of the United States of America, my friend, Joe Biden. Well, John, you are my friend, Mr. President. I want to say good afternoon to everyone, and it’s great to see you all. I’m here today above all else to say thank you. Thank you, President Costa and the entire executive board for the chance to speak with you all today. And thank you for being one of the first juniors to endorse me last year. You stepped up for me and I won’t forget it. And I thank you for the bravery and commitment you show to your jobs and to the people you serve every single day. A lot of people don’t get it. You’re in the front lines of this pandemic. And as we’ve all seen too clearly this week, COVID-19 is still a threat to our health, as well as our economic security. We have to do so much more to step up to get this virus under control. We need to take science, the science of fighting this disease seriously if we’re going to save lives. That means making sure essential workers, and you all are that and more, folks like you get to, and the people who are doing all of the work on the buses, subway system, keeping the country moving every single day, you have to make sure you get all the PPE you need. You need it for job safety, and for our safety, to be able to continue to transport people. We need a nation-wide mask guidance so that no one gets on a public transportation unit without a mask. When they turned that request down, the Department of Transportation, they made a gigantic mistake. It’s everyone’s pay … It’s not something that has taken away someone’s freedom. It’s a patriotic duty to wear a mask. You do it not just to protect yourself, but to protect one another. It’s essential. You should be worried about the person next to you, in front of you, your husband, wife, mother, father, friend, neighbor. It’s essential. And it can save, as the experts have told us, up to a hundred thousand lives just between now and the end of the year, where it’s estimated by the University of Washington, as many as 200,000 more people will die from COVID unless we do something. 89 ATO members, as you’ve already … We just had a moment of silence, lost their lives to this virus. It’s heartbreaking. Think of the families that get up this morning and there’s an empty chair at the table. It’s unacceptable. We all know. I know what it’s like to have that kind of loss. It’s unacceptable. Even before this pandemic, we knew that your jobs were dangerous. You face harassments and threats of violence and so much more. So, we need to put in place the protections and precautions to keep you safe in your work. You’re there every single day for the people who depend on you. You deserve leadership in government who will be there for you, will fight for you, prioritize your health, your safety, and in the process, prioritizing everybody’s health and safety. You’re the ones who fight for the right to organize and bargain collective. And I promise you, the National Labor Relations Act way back in the ’30s, everybody thinks that said, okay, now we can have unions. If you go back and read it, it said we should encourage unions, encourage unions. That’s what it was intended to do. My dad used to have an expression. He said the only way to fight the abuse of power is with power. Power. And the only power we have to fight back is unions, unions who understand that Wall Street didn’t build this country. Middle class built this country, and unions built the middle class. That’s not hyperbole. That’s a fact. And I’ll be a president who sees you, respects you, and that’s my promise to you. I’ve been running on support for public transit my entire career. Our transportation workers were with me since my first Senate campaign back a hundred years ago in 1972 when I was a 29 year old kid, and I won by 3,200 votes in no small part because you guys came out for me. Enhancing and upgrading our public transportation structures is an essential part of my build back better plan to get us out of this recession. But I also know that people need help right now. You need help right now. With so many fewer people riding public transit right now, we need to make sure that state and local governments have the funding they need to keep you running. Thanks to your leadership, the Cares Act secured $25 billion in emergency operating aid for transit. But I think we need to do more. We need to do more than just thank you. We need to pay you. Excuse me. This pandemic has taken the blinders off so many Americans. It’s shown us so clearly just how much we depend on you and all essential workers and how much we owe you. I’m not just saying that. That’s a fact. So, I’m going to say thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for all you do for this country. And I know there’s so much more to say, but I know you have questions for me, John. And I’d just like to say again, thank you, and I’m happy to take a few questions. Thank you, Vice President. Yes, we have two questions. The first question is, for transit workers, the current President’s failure to manage COVID-19 crisis has cost our members their lives. As mentioned, we have lost 89 ATU brothers and sisters to this horrible virus. A recent ATU survey found that 50% of employers have not provided bus operators with the basic personal protection equipment, PPE like masks and gloves. Without federal government help, transit agencies have been forced to bid against each other for PPE. And as a result, securing the lifesaving equipment has been difficult. The President has said that the federal government is not a shipping clerk. It’s every state and every transit agency for themselves. Defying all common sense, the first few critical weeks of this pandemic, Trump’s Department of Transportation remarkably said on its website that PPE is not recommended at this time. Even now after the CDC recommended wearing face covering in a public setting where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain, the DLT has still not mandated masks on transit vehicles. So my question is, as a result, passengers with Coronavirus keep getting on the bus, infecting other passengers and transit workers, and there is no end in sight. Fundamentally differently. And I’m in a little bit of a spot here because I don’t want to be attacking the President and the First Lady now because they now have contracted Coronavirus, and Jill and I pray for their quick and full recovery, but our thoughts are with the families and the members you’ve lost as well. We have to bear the grief of an empty chair, an empty kitchen table chair, of not being able to turn and … I find myself when I lost folks in my family, you just tend to go. And you realize, no, it’s never coming back. This isn’t about politics. More than 200,000 Americans have died from COVID. 7.3 million have been infected. 30 million have lost paychecks, hours, or their jobs entirely. And throughout it all, you’ve kept the nation running. You’ve kept people connected. You put others before yourselves, and whether they understand it or not, and I think average Americans do now, we can’t thank you enough. It’s always been essential, even if the rest of the country is just learning what an essential worker really is. Now look, here’s what else is essential. Getting you the support you need to do your job. It’s not enough just to praise you. We have to protect and pay you. We have to work as hard as you, as hard work as you do for your communities. And here’s what I’ll do as President. Number one, call on every single American to wear a mask when they’re around other people outside their households. That includes when they ride public transportation, buses, trains airplanes. Yesterday, the transportation department, stupidly in my view, rejected a petition to require just that, wear a mask when you’re on public transportation. If I can say something here, this is not about freedom. It’s about patriotism. You wear a mask to protect the person next to you. You wear a mask to protect the bus driver. You wear a mask to protect the person you’re sitting next to on the bus. And to reject the chance to do the easiest thing possible to save lives, I find it appalling. I promise you my Department of Transportation will insist on it. Two, get protective gear to every worker on the front lines. It’s unconscionable that for so long Washington left our states, cities, and transit agencies to bid against one another. If that’s not the President’s responsibility, what the heck is his responsibility? Not my fault. I have no responsibility. Go to your mayor, your governor, your employer. It’s unconscionable that seven months in so many transit employees still aren’t provided enough PPE to keep you safe on the job. By the way paranthetically, it’s not just you guys he doesn’t care about. They don’t care about much of anybody. They started off promising they were going to give school teachers and school children masks to go back to school. Then, famous said, “No, it’s not an essential requirement.” Not essential. As President I’d use the full power of the Defense Production Act to get PPE out to every single transit worker, hospital, job site, and school in this country, and I’d appoint a supply commander to make sure it’s distributed fast and fairly. It’s within our power to do this, John. We can do this. And the idea that they’re kicking it off to the, “No, talk to your governor, not my responsibility,” come on. I don’t know. If that’s not a responsibility of a President in the middle of a crisis, I don’t know what in God’s name a responsibility is. Thirdly, we’ve got to fix the testing fiasco. Surging tens of millions of test kits where they’re needed most provide free testing and treatment and vaccine when it’s available for everyone, and make sure politics plays no role in vaccine approval. Period. I’ve actually told some governors, John, I probably shouldn’t say this, but you know me, told some governors, “Don’t endorse me. Don’t endorse me because you’ll pay a penalty. You won’t get what you need from the federal government in terms of his covert crap.” Not a joke. My word. Not a joke. We aren’t blue states and red states. We’re the United States. United States. If you elect me President, I’m going to be President for all Americans. I’m running as a Democrat proudly, but I’m going to make sure I’m President for the people who voted against me as much as those who voted for me. This division of our country is just devastating. Thirdly, or fourthly, I’m going to enforce tougher safety standards and get schools and businesses clean safety guidelines and resources, implement them. Tell people to stay healthy when they ride with you. And I’m going to fight to get you the hazard pay you deserve. And by the way, it’s not just about getting you masks. We also have to protect you. Look at the people. Look what’s happened to your drivers. A guy getting off a bus and says goodbye, and he slits the driver’s throat and kills him. Look what’s happening. We got to get you the protective gear. Not only that, we’ve got to get you separation. We’ve got to get plastic and coverings around the drivers. You’ve got to make sure that you have separation. There’s so much we can do. And it doesn’t cost that much. It doesn’t cost that much. But even if it did, it’s an obligation we have. I really mean it. I find this one of the most despicable things that I’ve encountered in my whole career. When the administration was told that there’s a thousand people a day dying of COVID, the response was, “It is what it is.” It is what it is? It is what it is because they are who they are. That’s why it is what it is. We can change this. I promise you on day one, I will. Thank you, Mr. President, Vice President. You kind of touched on, Joe, my second question. And that is, what is your plan to save transportation services in this country? Transit systems are running out of money. School bus contractors and motor coach companies are going out of business. Right now, we are facing layoffs all across the country. And the safety situation on the bus right now is terrible. Our members, they serve as mass police. That’s right. [inaudible 00:14:45] regulations while trying to drive a bus at the same time. Even before the pandemic, our ATU brothers and sisters had been getting attacked behind the wheel. Yep. Slapped. They get punched, spit on, held up at gunpoint, and stabbed. So Joe, I know you had brought a little bit of this up. Well first of all, we have to come together to beat the virus. Every path forward starts there. That’s how we get people back on the train, back on the buses, back on the school buses, back to go. They’re getting their lives back. And it’s how we keep our transit system solid. But along the way, one of the most urgent things we have to do is get emergency fundings out to states, cities, and transit authorities now. Now. Because of the ATU working with the House, you were able to work hard to see the 25 billion in aid that was included in the so-called Cares Act, those first pieces of relief legislation. But I know it’s not enough. Tens of thousands of transit workers have already been laid off. Tens of thousands. And I said for months, the Republican Senate needs to step up and pass another economic relief package right away so painful cuts don’t make this crisis worse. You may remember, John, when we went through this with the single-most significant recession in American history short of a depression, when Barack and I came into office and we were inherited the Bush recession. I was asked to manage the Recovery Act, which was $80 billion. Excuse me, $800 billion. And the first thing I was able to do is get over $140 billion to the states and localities so they didn’t have to lay off transit workers. They didn’t have to lay off school teachers. Didn’t have to lay off firefighters. They didn’t have to lay off police officers, because all the cities and counties have to work on balanced budgets. That’s why the founders said we didn’t have to balance budgets nationally to be able to compensate when things got bad. Well, House passed the package twice. It’s time for Mitch McConnell to do his job and save millions more hardworking Americans that don’t lose theirs. By the way, we said, “The states are going to go bankrupt.” He said, “Let them go bankrupt.” Well, we need better protection to keep you safe as well during this COVID crisis, as we discussed, but go far beyond. I’m never going to forget the bravery of Thomas Dunn, who was so viciously attacked while driving his route in Tampa last year. But somehow, still steered his passengers safely to roadside before he died. He warned about driver’s safety months before, but was left unprotected. As President, I promise you I’ll fight to get past the Transit Worker and Pedestrian Protection Act to get barriers installed to stop that kind of assault, to reduce blind spots, to make so many other things possible for you. It’s ridiculous. Like I said, I just had my license to drive a school bus when I was in law school. I can tell you what. It was hard just working out what the kids were doing behind me. I can’t fathom today. I can’t fathom today driving a bus or running a subway without having more protection. I promise you I’ll invest a record amount in infrastructure, dramatically increasing the funding for public transit to help power our recovery. That includes improving transit bus lines, helping cities and towns and small new light rail networks, investing funds in low-income communities. Somewhere between 60 and 70% of the American people who live in inner cities, their jobs are outside the city and they don’t have vehicles. They need transportation to get to their work, to improve their neighborhoods, to improve their schools. Look, this is a crisis, and we have a real opportunity to build back better. And you all, your dedication is going to get us there. But here’s the thing. Yes. Look. What people don’t get, you guys get it, is if we invest significantly in transit, I want to invest about three quarters of a trillion dollars in transit overall, because it does two things. One, it gets people off the highways. And if you know if you have long distance transit, if you can get there as fast in a train or on a rail as you can in a vehicle, people leave their cars and get in the rail. That will save billions of gallons of oil over time and deal with pollution. Light rail in cities. I’m going to say something. One of your executive vice-presidents from Detroit, one of the things I was able to do in addition to getting our 200 buses in Detroit, we put in a light rail system. Why? Because an awful lot of those people there worked in the hospitals outside of town. And then in town, they could get back and forth to work. It saved the city, and has significantly increased the capacity to do more in the city and outside the city. We’re in a position that if we invest in rail, light rail, if we invest in buses, and we’re going to change the way buses run, we’re going to have buses that run. We’re going to get electric buses down the road. We’re going to own the electric market in vehicles, both in buses as well as automobiles, creating well over a million new jobs. Not a joke. And by the way, the Wall Street guys looked at my numbers and what I was talking about and acknowledged my plan will create seven million more jobs than the President’s, and increase by $1 trillion economic growth, because we have to start using our brain. We can both deal with climate, employment, and health if we in fact move in a direction to focus heavily on transit. If I can give you one little example, and I know the folks who are … That’s a slightly different operation, but Amtrak. In order to build, if we eliminated Amtrak on the Northeast Carter, we’d have to build eight new lanes of I-95 from Washington to New York. One mile of I-95, the cement and all that’s needed, is $20 million. $20 million. Imagine what would happen if we didn’t have rail, and imagine what would happen if we had high-speed rail. Imagine what would happen if all these towns and cities had light rail that could get people to and from work. It would save them money, save them opportunities, provide more opportunities for them. I know I’m going on too long, but this transportation is such an incredible part of our economic recovery. And by the way, we’ve got to make sure you start to get paid what you deserve. Paid what you deserve. But first and foremost, I promise you I’m going to get you all the PPE that’s necessary. That’s a promise. Secondly, we’re going to make sure you are safe on your transportation system where you are operating it. And that means plexiglass. That means mirrors. That means a whole range of things we can change in order to deal with this. And because I tell you what, you’re the guys and women I grew up with. You’re the people who make it run. Like I said, I’ll end where I began. I view things from Scranton, not from Wall Street. I view things from the folks I was raised with. A trolley line ran by my house. It was a great equalizer for everybody. We’re in a situation where we can change things drastically for the better and help everyone across the board. The wealthy will do just fine when we do better. Everybody does fine. Everybody does fine. But most important, your personal safety is critical. And I really mean it. I give you my word. So thank you, John. Thank you for your help. And thank all of you. In case you see me looking to my left here, that’s where all of you are up on the screen. There’s about 500 of you on a screen up here. So hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. And I’m looking at … Where was a beautiful little baby being held by a dad a moment ago? Anyway, that’s awful punishment to make a kid have to watch me on television here on a Zoom, but thank you very much. Appreciate it. Mr. Vice President, you didn’t go on too long. Actually, it was great to hear someone that gets it and someone that actually felt like they know our job. I haven’t heard that in a long time. We can do so much, John. We are in position. If we win this thing, we’re in a position to change the country. I really mean it. I really mean it. There’s gigantic hope out there. I’m confident. There’s so much we can do. And transportation is such a critical part of it all. The overall infrastructure, the overall economic recovery, making sure people … Anyway, I am going on too much, but I love you guys. Thank you. Thank you, and I just wanted to say some closing remarks. Vice President Biden, thank you for joining us today. Our members learned a lot about your views on the key issues that matter most to them. We hope you will stay safe and healthy and go on to win back this country. Brothers and sisters, thank you for joining us today for this special event. Early voting has already begun in many states. If you’re going out to the polls, be safe. If you are voting by mail, get your ballot in. Despite what you are hearing from the other side, voting by mail is totally fine. However you do it, just vote. Vote as if your job is on a line because it is. Vote as if your health is on a line because it is. Vote as if our way of life is on the line because it is. Get out and vote for this courageous, honest, and decent man who will lead our country back from the brink, Joe Biden. We can do this, folks. I promise you. Thank you. Thank you, Joe. And have a good evening. Putting on my mask. Thank you everybody. Be safe. Brothers and sisters, I hope you enjoyed. Please vote. We need to change this."
"116","10-05-19"," Before you, I’m going to make a quick statement here. We’ve got to get something straight. All this talk of the president about corruption comes from the most corrupt president we’ve had in modern history. He’s the definition of corruption. He’s corrupted the agencies of government, from the Defense Department, from the State Department, from the Justice Department, all about making sure that he, in fact, allows somebody else to pick his opponent for him. That’s what this is about. And I am not going to stand for it. And I’m not going to respond to it. I’m not going to talk about anything other than what the facts are. He’s indicted himself by his own statements. This is not about me. It’s not about my son. There’s not a shred of evidence there’s anything done that’s been wrong. And so, I’ll take your questions. [crosstalk 00:00:00:51]. You had said that you didn’t support an impeachment inquiry unless the White House was stonewalling document requests. The White House is … The Democrats are having trouble getting documents. I said from the beginning, the constitutional process, not withstanding what he calls it, he calls the impeachment proceeding a “coup,” a coup. He talks about how we should handle whistleblowers. He talks about, there will be a civil war. This is a guy that’s unhinged. He is unhinged. I worry about what he’s going to do, not about me or my family, I’m worried about what he’ll do in the next year in the presidency as this thing continues to rot on his watch. [crosstalk 00:00:01:32]. You spent so much time in the Senate. The Senate is where there would be a trial of this president. I am not going to speculate what I would do in the Senate. I’m a former vice president. I know what occurred in Ukraine. I know what occurred in terms of China. I know what occurred in terms of Russia. This is a president trying to get three of our most … two of our most serious competitors, and not allies, to decide this election, decide who he runs against. This guy, like all bullies, is a coward. He does not want to run against me. That’s what this is about. [crosstalk 00:02:13]. How was your role, Mr. Excuse me. There is a photo of you golfing with your son, Hunter, and his business partner, Devon Archer. Yes, I stand by that statement. [crosstalk 00:00:02:31]. It’s not a conflict of interest. There’s been no indication of any conflict of interest, from Ukraine or anywhere else. Period. I’m not going to respond to that. Let’s focus on the problem. Focus on this man, what he’s doing, that no president has ever done. No president. [crosstalk 00:02:59]. On the Iranian hackers, was your campaign in charge of [inaudible 00:03:05]. I have no idea whether it was or not. [crosstalk 00:00:03:09]. Because the irony of all ironies is that you press people are doing your job. You’re pointing out when he’s flat lying, where there is no evidence. None, not a scintilla, not one little tiny piece. The American people know me, and they know him. They know, even the people who support him know this man lacks character. Even the people who support him know he lies constantly. So look, I am not worried about what … Here’s what I’m worried about. I’m worried that he gets so unhinged, of the year left to go in this administration, he does something really, really, really stupid in terms of our international interest. I don’t mean about our election, that’s already … He’s basically acknowledged he’s tried to get people to interfere in our election, let other people decide who the candidate was going to be. But the fact of the matter is, I worry. And you do too, in your heart. The fact of the matter is you wonder what this guy is going to do. Have you ever seen, a rhetorical question, a president ever so unhinged as this guy is? That’s what worries me. Let the House focus on what they’re focusing on, and the Senate, and I’m going to go out and I’m going to beat him on the merits. Thank you. [crosstalk 00:04:34]. Would you testify at an impeachment-"
"117","10-05-20"," Good afternoon, everyone. It’s great to be back in Miami. And thank you, Esther. I told you our family has been, unfortunately, this considerable consumer of healthcare. Please all sit down. Of healthcare and I’ve learned from personal experience as my sons, my daughter, my wife, family has learned if there are any angels in heaven, they’re all nurses, male and female. Docs let you live and nurses make you want to live. I really mean it. They’re there at the tough times. And by the way, thank you for your service in the military, but also thank you for the beginning of this pandemic. Being a surgical nurse wasn’t easy when there wasn’t the PPE available to all of you as you walked into those operating rooms and dealt with all the problems. I know my son-in-law’s a physician surgeon in Philadelphia and the stories at the beginning of this process, when we should have had everything available. So thank you not only for your skill and your courage, but your bravery and doing what you’ve done. And I want to thank you for the care dedication that you went on, all your fellow SEIU members, all your nurses that show up and struggle with illness or coping with the loss of a loved one in terrible times. So many of you had to hold a phone to a patient’s ear to say goodbye to a family member because they couldn’t be there. They couldn’t see them in the hospital as they passed. Now, I want to thank Victoria, Victoria for sharing her family’s journey with us today. Victoria and I were talking a little bit earlier. I was in South Asia speaking with a president and he asked me what made America unique? And I said immigration because it’s the history of this country. And he looked at me funny. And I said, because almost everybody who’s come here, other than those who came in chains 400 years ago came because they’re escaping something and it took enormous courage. I really mean this. Think about it, enormous courage to leave everything they knew, everything that was familiar, sometimes leaving family members to get on a boat, a plane, train, whatever the means was to be able to leave and start a new life. And to do that, you have to have optimism, courage. You have to be resilient. You have to be willing to believe you can make things change for the better. That’s what’s built this country, immigration. We are, not figuratively, it’s a phrase used to not often fully appreciated, a nation of immigrants. That’s why we’re the most unique and strongest nation in the world. It’s family like yours and Esther’s that have made this country what it is through the hard work and faith and perseverance. The richness and beauty of Miami is built from the connections of family, culture, values that we share with our friends throughout the Caribbean and Latin America. Earlier this afternoon, I visited Little Haiti. Had been some years since been there when the earthquake occurred and I came to deliver some assistance to the Haitian community, as well as making sure we had temporary protective status granted. It’s a cultural complex and now here at the site name for one of Cuba’s most celebrated poets and thinkers. This city is living proof of the incredible strength that we draw from families and communities from every culture choosing America. So thank you, Victoria, for choosing us and I’m really honored that you’re going to vote for me in your first election. I promise you I will not let you down. I promise you I will not let you down. And let me also say at the top, my prayers continue to be with the president and the first lady for their health and safety as they like so many American families are dealing with COVID-19. I was glad to see the president speaking and recording videos over the weekend. Now that he’s busy tweeting campaign messages, I would ask him to do this, listen to the scientists, support masks, support a mask mandate nationwide, require a mask in every federal building and facility and interstate travel, urge every governor, mayor to do the same. We know it saves lives. His administration just rejected a mask mandate for public transportation on Friday. The CIA came along and said, we need to be protected and they said, no. I believe that was wrong and not very rational experts say that universal masking could say between now and January 100,000 lives. Let me say that again. Between now and January, mandatory masking could save 100,000 lives. I backed that mandate months ago. He should back it now. Since the president entered the hospital on Friday, since Friday, more than 100,000 more people have been diagnosed with COVID. And this week, at least 5,000 more will die. Cases and deaths are climbing in many states. I hope the president’s recovery is swift and successful, but our nation’s covered crisis is far, far from over. Today, my prayers are with the families of the 210,000 Americans who died from the virus. All those families who got up this morning and there was an empty chair at the breakfast table, tonight, an empty chair at the dinner table where one should be, husband, wife, son, daughter, mother, father. And nearly 7. And nearly 7.5 million Americans have been infected with the virus to date. This pandemic and economic collapse has hit the Hispanic communities, particularly hard. Nationally, the infection rate among Hispanics is almost three times higher than white, non Hispanics. More than 40,000 Hispanics have died from COVID-19, devastating families and close knit communities of loved ones. And here in Florida, where Hispanics make up about one quarter of the population, they make up 37% of the COVID deaths. Nearly 3 million Hispanics are unemployed. If you break that down, that last data, unemployment for Hispanic women and Hispanic youth actually went up last month. One in three Hispanic, small business owners have taken a hit and many are likely to have to close permanently. Some economists are calling this what they call a K shaped recovery. It means those at the top, they keep going up, their income. But everyone from the middle and lower-income, it keeps going down, keeps getting worse. Means that essential workers, so many of whom are Hispanic, have sacrificed to keep us going through this pandemic are being left behind by the most unequal recovery in modern American history. Because while workers are struggling, this is a shocking statistic, but it’s true, the top 100 billionaires in America have done pretty well. Just since the COVID crisis they have made an additional $300 billion. The top 100 additional made an additional $300 billion. Everyone else though, they got the bottom half of that K, downward, a downward slide. You’re left to figure out how you’re going to pay your bills, put food on the table, pay the rent, or if you’re lucky enough to own a home, will you have enough money to pay the mortgage? How to balance doing your job with being a teacher to your kids, because their school has gone remote. You’re asked to risk your neck if you can’t work from home, while the risk of COVID are mostly kept outside, because you’re one of our first responders, a union nurse like Ester or on an assembly line, or working in a customer service or tourism industry or at a checkout counter or police office, firefighter. I know this isn’t an easy time, but I also think this pandemic has just helped us rip off the blinders in this country as how inequitable so many things are. People didn’t even realize, and so now they’ve seen it. I truly believe we have a tremendous opportunity to turn this moment of crisis in a moment of great progress for the country. That’s why I’ve laid out a comprehensive agenda, not just to rebuild our communities, but to build them back, make bold investments in them so we can build back better than before the crisis. An independent analysis, President talks about… he loves talking about Wall Street. He never talks about Moody’s on wall street that pointed out, they did a detailed assessment of my economic plan and his. And here’s what Moody’s concluded. They projected my economic plan will create 18.6 million jobs, 7 million more jobs in the president’s economic plan will in four years and $1 trillion more in growth than the president’s plan. And here’s how it works. I’m not going to raise taxes on anyone who makes less than $400,000 a year. You won’t pay a penny more. I guarantee you. But I’m going to ask the big corporations and the super wealthy to begin to pay their fair share. It’s not punishment. It just about time you start paying your fair share. The money we raise from making sure they pay their fair share will allow me to invest it in working people on a growing middle class. When I announced I said I wanted to rebuild the backbone of this country. Working folks, the middle class. They weren’t built by wall street. It was built by labor. Advance racial equity across the economy to make sure everyone is included in the deal this time. We’re going to invest it in creating millions of good paying jobs, union jobs in manufacturing and technology, making sure our future is made in America. In infrastructure, building roads, bridges, highways, ports, and airports like I was able to do when I ran the Recovery Act for our administration, putting billions of dollars in the Port of Miami, creating so good, hard working people with good decent union jobs, able to accommodate the new supertankers coming through the canal, generating some stability. My plan will make sure Hispanic communities benefit from hundreds of billions of dollars in investments, to fill the cracks in the sidewalks, install broadband, close the digital divide, create spaces to live, work, and play in safely. And clean energy. We upgrade 4 million buildings, weatherize 2 million homes. We’ll create, at least, the estimates are at least 1 million good paying jobs and save us millions and millions of barrels of oil. We’re going to meet the threat of climate change and invest in strengthening climate resilience, where we are already dealing with an existential threat of climate change. I don’t have to tell you in Miami, don’t have to tell you in South Florida or in my state, which has the lowest sea level, lowest degree of height from sea level than any state in the nation. Stronger, more frequent hurricanes, rising tides, flooding. And no matter where the president says, maybe you should consider dropping an atomic weapon on a hurricane coming our way is not a good idea. It doesn’t work. Look, that’s not some distant future in Miami or South Florida. You’re dealing with it right now. We’re going to make sure the small businesses could come out the other side of this crisis with access to capital and the ability to deal with their debts. My plan will get $50 billion in capital flowing to small businesses, which would get repaid in employment and taxes, especially minority owned small businesses and make another $100 billion in low interest loans available to those businesses to get back on their feet and stay alive, because you know as well as I do, and ethnic communities, they are the heartbeat, they’re the center of a community. Whether it’s a grocery store, a beauty shop, the barbershop, the hardware store, the essence of a community. We’re going to make investments to increase incomes as well. It’s long past time. I’ve worked with Governor Cuomo to get it done in New York and other governors across the country. No one should have to work two jobs to be able to be 40 hours a week, so they’re above the poverty rate. $15 should be a minimum wage in the United States of America, period. And for our essential workers, we’re not just going to praise you, we’re going to begin to pay you a good wage, be sure you have strong benefits. We’re going to ease the burden of the major costs in your life. What are they? Healthcare. We’re going to build on the Affordable Care Act, which gave 4 million Hispanic people in this country health insurance, by adding a new health insurance option, a not for profit public option. We’re going to give private insurers a real competitor. We’re going to increase subsidies, so your premiums are lower and you can and afford plans with lower deductibles and lower out-of-pocket expenses. We’re going to take on the pharmaceutical industry, a plan that slashes the cost of prescription drugs by 60%. You think I’m making these numbers up. If we just let Medicare negotiate independently for all the drugs they purchase, I promise you the rates are going to fall through the floor. Affordable and accessible. Every three and four year old will have access to free quality preschool. All the studies at great universities and all the ones around the country have shown that no matter what zip code a child comes from, no matter what background, if they go to preschool, not daycare, preschool in school at three, four, and five years old, they increase exponentially, over by over 50% a prospect they’ll go through all 12 years and many beyond. And we’ll make sure, sure that low and middle-income… and by the way, the total cost of that… it’s called Title 1 program. We now spend $15 billion for in school districts that don’t have high tax rates. Well, guess what? You change that to 45. You can put every one of these kids in school, pay the teachers legitimate rate and make sure that you have school psychologists and social workers in those schools. We’re going to make sure that for childcare, for someone under the age of five or six, no one ever has to pay more than 7% of their income for their young children to get quality childcare, because you truly want to reward work in this country. We have to ease the financial burden of the care that families are carrying. Even before the pandemic, and many of you know it and many of you are doing it, millions of working families faced enormous financial and personal strains, trying to raise their kids and care for their parents or loved ones living with a disability. It’s going to sound strange, when I first got elected, when I was 29 years old to Senate, right after I got elected, my wife and daughter were killed. My two sons survived after hospitalized for a long time. I needed help do my job. I could not possibly afford childcare. Even though I was making a really good salary of $42,000 a year, more than I’d ever made. And I couldn’t afford it. Being a single mom or dad or a family that has two people working with young children, it’s incredibly costly. And by the way, and the professional caregivers out there, home health workers, childcare workers, were more often women, women of color and immigrants, and too often underpaid, unseen and undervalued. … Back Better Plan will elevate the compensation benefits and dignity of caregivers and workers and early childhood educators. That’s what we’re going to do. It’s also going to invest in education beyond high school. If you qualify to get into community college, you’ll automatically be able to go, and you’ll be able to go for free. If you are qualified to get into a four-year public school in your state public college, and your family makes less than $125, 000 a year, you get to go free. If you’re buying your first home, you’re going to have a tax credit up to $15,000 to get there. What happened after the Great Recession in this one? An awful lot of you range in age from the millennials have started off back after 9/11, all the way to the people graduating this year… Are not in a position to do that, because your jobs have been postponed or non-existent. But providing an opportunity, I can get you into the system. We’re also going to protect Social Security, increase the benefits for millions of seniors. We’re going to do that all in a partnership and lockstep with the Hispanic community. And by the way, the President’s proposal to eliminate the tax you pay when you get your paycheck for Social Security, without any means by which to replace it, the actuary at social security said Social Security will be bankrupt by 2023. They’ve never liked it to begin with. So look, success and prosperity of the Hispanic Americans is indispensable to the success and prosperity of the United States, and of all America. It’s that simple. Hispanic families are responsible today for $2.6 trillion of our gross domestic product, and growing. If that was a standalone economy, a country all by itself, it would be the eighth largest economy in the world. Think of that. Now imagine how much more that would grow if everyone had access to the tools they need to succeed. By investing in Hispanic communities, we’re making the smartest possible investment with the greatest possible returns that our nation could make, period. We also need to rebuild our ability to work with our partners throughout the Western hemisphere to realize the enormous potential of this region in the world, to confront those leaders who continue to oppress the rights of their people. We should be leading the international effort to confront the massive humanitarian crisis in Venezuela. Maduro, who I’ve met, is a dictator, plain and simple, and he’s causing incredible suffering among the Venezuelan people to maintain his grip on power. The Venezuelan people need our support to recover or their democracy and rebuild their country. That’s why I would immediately grant temporary protective status to Venezuelans as President. So the Republicans in the Senate can’t keep blocking it like they did again just last week. I’ll make sure we’re supporting neighboring countries that are being overrun with immigration because of Maduro, like Columbia, which are caring for millions of Venezuelans who’ve fled their country in desperation. I’ll use sanctions as one of the tools for a comprehensive strategy that includes humanitarian assistance, international pressure, and support for democratic actors in Venezuela to force the regime to embark on the road to a free and fair election. We also need a new Cuba policy. The administration’s approach is not working. Cuba is no closer to freedom and democracy than it was four years ago. The fact there’s more political prisoners, the secret police are as brutal as ever, and Russia is once again a major presence in Cuba in Havana… For my entire career, I strived for democracy and human rights, for freedom of the press, assembly and religion against dictators of the left and the right. As President, my policy will be governed by two principles. First, Americans, especially Cuban-Americans, are the best ambassadors for freedom in Cuba. Second, empowering the Cuban people to determine their own future is central to a national security interest in the United States. I think it’s unconscionable that the current administration is deporting hundreds of Cubans back to a dictatorship. There are almost 10,000 Cubans languishing in tent camps along the Mexican border because the administration’s anti-immigration agenda. That’s the administration actively separating Cuban families by not processing visas, through restrictions on family visits and remittances. I think we have to reverse that. The bottom line is that President Trump can not advance the democracy and human rights for the American people when he has embraced so many autocrats around the world, starting with Vladimir Putin. Folks, we can do this. We can reach for more as a nation. We can rebuild. We can rebuild the backbone of this country and finally bring everybody along. America’s always done best coming out of crisis. We’re the only nation it’s always come out of every crisis better than we went in. We can build a new administration that reflects the full diversity of our nation, including Hispanic communities. And Hispanic voters, especially in Florida, can help put our nation on a new path forward. And here in Florida today as the deadline to register to vote ends today… If you haven’t registered, go out right now because it is an obligation. Every vote will make a difference. Check and make sure your family and friends are registered, and then make sure everyone has a plan to vote. If you can vote by mail, vote by mail. If you can vote in person, vote in person, if you can vote early, vote early. You can vote early in person starting on October 19th in many places in Florida, including right here in Miami. Just make sure you vote. Together we can win. We can’t let this pandemic change everything. We’ve got to get it under control so we can get our economy working again for everyone. We can come together as a nation. I’m running as a Democrat. Proud of it, but I will be an American President, not a democratic President with a capital D. I’ll fight as hard for you and your family whether you vote for me or whether you vote against me because there’s nothing we can’t do when we do it together. Folks, I’ve been other more optimistic about our chances as a nation in the 21st century than I’ve been my whole career. There’s not a single solitary thing that’s beyond our capacities as a nation. I mean that sincerely. The most talented workers in the world… We’re the most incredible system in the world. We have a people, who when they stand together, have never, ever, ever, ever failed. Every time I’d walk out of my grandpa’s house up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, he’d yell, “Joey, keep the faith.” My grandma, when she was alive, would yell back, “No, Joey, spread it.” Let’s go spread the faith. Take back this country. We’re so much better than this. God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you. (music)"
"118","10-06-20"," Thank you all for being here. Thank you. I appreciate you being here on this gorgeous day in a magnificent, magnificent setting, until you think about all the lives that were lost here. Please, all have a seat. On July 4th, 1863, American woke to the remains of perhaps the most consequential battle in American soil. It took place here on this ground in Gettysburg; three days of violence, three days of carnage, 50,000 casualties, wounded, captured, missing, or dead, over three days of fighting. When the sun rose on that Independence Day, Lee would retreat. The war would go on for nearly two more years, but the back of the Confederacy had been broken. The Union would be saved. Slavery would be abolished, government of by and for the people would not perish from the earth, and freedom would be born anew in our land. There’s no more fitting place than here today in Gettysburg, to talk about the cost of division. About how much it has cost America in the past, about how much it is costing us now, and about why I believe in this moment, we must come together as a nation. For President Lincoln, the Civil War was about the greatest of causes. The end of slavery, widening equality, pursuit of justice, the creation of opportunity, and the sanctity of freedom. His words would live ever after. We hear them in our heads. We know them in our hearts. We draw on them when we seek hope in hours of darkness; “Four score, and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.” Here on this sacred ground, Abraham Lincoln, re-imagined America itself. Here, a president of the United States spoke of the price of division, and the meaning of sacrifice. He believed in the rescue, redemption, and rededication of the union. All this in a time, not just of ferocious division, but of widespread death, structural inequity, and fear of the future. And he taught us this, a house divided could not stand. That is a great and timeless truth. Today, once again, we are a house divided, but that my friends can no longer be. We’re facing too many crises. We have too much work to do. We have to bright a future to have it shipwrecked on the Shoals of anger and hate, and division. As we stand here today, a century and a half later after Gettysburg, we should consider again, what can happen when equal justice is denied, when anger and violence and division are left unchecked. As I look across America today, I’m concerned. The country is in a dangerous place. Our trust in each other is ebbing. Hope seems elusive. Too many Americans see our public life, not as an arena for mediation of our differences, but rather they see it as an occasion for total, unrelenting, partisan warfare. Instead of treating each other’s party as the opposition, we treat them as the enemy. This must end. We need to revive the spirit of bipartisanship in this country. A spirit of being able to work with one another. When I say that, and I’ve been saying it for two years now, I’m accused of being naive. I’m told, “Maybe that’s the way things used to work, Joe, but they can’t work that way anymore.” Well, I’m here to tell you they can, and they must if we’re going to get anything done. I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president. I’ll work with Democrats and Republicans. I’ll work as hard for those who don’t support me, as those who do. That’s the job of a president; the duty to care for everyone. It was a lot of Democrats and Republicans to cooperate with one another is not due to some mysterious force beyond our control. It’s a decision. It’s a choice we make. And if we can decide not to cooperate, we can decide to cooperate as well. That’s the choice I’ll make as president. But there’s something bigger going on in this nation than just our broken politics. Something darker, something more dangerous. I’m not talking about ordinary differences of opinion, competing viewpoints give life and vibrancy to our democracy. No, I’m talking about something different, something deeper. Too many Americans seek not to overcome our divisions, but to deepen them, we must seek not to build walls, but bridges. We must seek not to have our fist clenched, but our arms open. We have to seek not to tear each other apart, we seek to come together. You don’t have to agree with me on everything, or even on most things, to see that we’re experiencing today is neither good nor normal. I made the decision to run for president after Charlottesville. Close your eyes, and remember what you saw. Neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and the KKK coming out of the fields with torches light, veins bulging, chanting the same anti-Semitic bile herd across Europe in the ’30s. It was hate on the march, in the open, in America. Hate never goes away, it only hides. And when it’s given oxygen, when it’s given an opportunity to spread, when it’s treated as normal and acceptable behavior, we’ve opened a door in this country that we must move quickly to close. As president, that’s just what I will do. I will send a clear unequivocal message to the entire nation, there is no place for hate in America. It will be given no license. It will be given no oxygen. It’ll be given no safe harbor. In recent weeks and months, the country has been riled by instances of excessive police force, heart-wrenching cases of racial injustice and lives needlessly and senselessly lost, by peaceful protesters, given voice to the calls for justice, by examples of violence and looting and burning that can not be tolerated. I believe in law and order, I’ve never supported defunding the police. But I also believe injustice is real. It’s a product of a history that goes back 400 years, the moment when black men, women, and children first were brought here in chains. I do not believe we have to choose between law and order, and racial justice in America. We can have both. This is the nation strong enough to both honestly face systemic racism and strong enough to provide safe streets for our families and small businesses. The two often bear the brunt of this looting and burning. We have no need for armed militias roaming America’s streets, and we should have no tolerance for extremist white supremacy groups, menacing our communities. If you say, “We should trust America’s law enforcement authorities to do the job,” as I do, then let them do their job without extremist groups acting as vigilantes. If you say, “We have no need to face racial injustice in the country,” you haven’t opened your eyes to the truth in America. There’ve been powerful voices for justice in recent weeks and months, George Floyd’s, six year old daughter, who I met with, who looked at me and said in her small child’s voice, “Daddy changed the world.” Also, Jacob Blake’s mother was another. When she said, “Violence didn’t reflect her son and this nation needed healing.” And Doc Rivers, the basketball coach, choking back tears when he said, “We’re the ones getting killed. We’re the ones getting shot. We’ve been hung. It’s amazing [inaudible 00:13:49] we keep loving this country and this country does not love us back. I think about that. I think about what it takes for a black person to love America. That is a deep love for this country. That has for far too long, never been recognized. What we need in America’s leadership that seeks to deescalate tensions, to open lines of communications, to bring us together, to heal, to hope. As president, that’s precisely what I will do. We paid a high price for allowing the deep divisions in this country to impact on how we deal with the Coronavirus. 210,000 Americans dead, and the number’s climbing. It’s estimated that nearly another 210,000 Americans could lose their lives by the end of the year; enough, no more. Let’s just set partisanship aside, let’s end the politics and follow the science. Wearing a mask is not a political statement. It’s a scientific recommendation. Social distancing isn’t a political statement. It’s a scientific recommendation. Testing, tracing, the development and all approval and distribution of a vaccine, isn’t a political statement. It is a science-based decision. We can’t undo what has been done. We can’t go back. We can do so much better. We can do better starting today. We can have a national strategy that puts politics aside and saves lives. We can have a national strategy that will make it possible for our schools and business to open safely. We can have a national strategy that reflects the true values of this nation. This pandemic is not a red state or blue state issue. This virus doesn’t care whether you live, or where you live, what political party you belong to, it affects us all. It will take anyone’s life. It’s a virus. It’s not a political weapon. There’s another enduring division in America that we must end, the division in our economic life. That gives opportunity only to the privileged few. America has to be about mobility. It has to be the kind of country where an Abraham Lincoln, a child of the distant frontier, can rise to the highest office in the land. America has to be about possibilities. The possibility of prosperity, not just for the privileged few, but for the many, for all of us. Working people on their kids deserve an opportunity. Lincoln knew this. He said that the country had to give people, and I quote, “An open field and a fair chance. An open field and a fair chance.” That’s what we’re going to do in America. We’re going to build together. We fought a civil war that would secure a union that would seek to fulfill the promise of equality for all. And by fits and starts, our better angels had prevailed again, just enough, just enough against our worst impulses to make a new and better nation. And those better angels can prevail again, now. They must prevail again, now. 100 years after Lincoln spoke at Gettysburg, the vice president, Lyndon B Johnson also came here, and here’s what he said. He said, “Our nation founded soul and honor in these fields of Gettysburg, we must not lose that soul in dishonor, now, on the fields of hate.” Today, we’re engaged, once again, in the battle for the soul of the nation, the forces of darkness, the forces of division, the forces of yesterday are pulling us apart, holding us down and holding us back. We must free ourselves of all of them. As president, I will embrace hope, not fear. Peace, not violence. Generosity, not greed. And light, not darkness. I’ll be a president who appeals to the best in us, not the worst. I’ll be a president who pushes toward the future, not one who clings to the past. I’m ready to fight for you and for our nation every day, without exception, without reservation, with a full and devoted heart. We cannot, and will not, allow extremest and white supremacist to overturn the America of Lincoln and Harriet Tubman, and Frederick Douglas, to overturn the America that has welcomed immigrants from distant shores, to overturn the America that has been a Haven and a home for everyone, no matter their background. From Seneca falls to Selma, to Stonewall we’re at our best when the promise of America is available to all, we cannot, and we will not allow violence in the street to threaten the people of this nation. We cannot and will not walk away from our obligation to at long last, face the wrecking on race and racial justice in this country. We cannot and will not continue to be struck in the partisan politics that lets us, this virus, thrive, while the public health of this nation suffers. We cannot and will not accept an economic equation that only favors those who have already got it made; everybody deserves a shot at prosperity. Folks, duty and history call presidents to provide for the common good, and I will. It won’t be easy. Won’t be easy. Our divisions today are long standing, economic and racial inequities have shaped us for generations, but I give you my word. I give you my word. If I’m elected president, I will Marshall the ingenuity and Goodwill of this nation to turn division into unity and bring us together because I think people are looking for that. We can disagree about how as we move forward, we must take the first steps. It starts with how we treat one another. How we talk to one another. How we respect one another. In the second inaugural Lincoln said, “With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we’re in to build up the nation’s wounds, bind up the nation’s wounds.” Now, we have our work to reunite America. To bind up our nation’s wounds. To move past shadow and suspicion. And so we, you and I together, we press on, even now. After hearing the second inaugural address, Frederick Douglas told President Lincoln, “Mr. Lincoln, that was a sacred effort.” We have to be dedicated to our own sacred effort. The promise of Gettysburg and the new birth of freedom was in hand. I think it’s at risk. Every generation that’s followed Gettysburg has been faced with a moment when it must answer this question, will they allow the sacrifices made here to be in vain, or be fulfilled? This is our moment to answer this essential American question, for ourselves and for our time. And my answer is this, it cannot be that after all this country has been through, after all that America’s accomplished, after all the years, we have stood as a beacon of light to the world. It cannot be that here and now in 2020, we will allow the government of the people, by the people, and for the people to perish this earth. No, it cannot. And it must not. We have it in our hands, the ultimate power. The power to vote. Its the note instrument ever devised to register our will in a peaceable and productive fashion. And so we must. We must vote. We will vote. No matter how many obstacles are thrown in our way, because once America votes, America will be heard. Lincoln said, “The nation is worth fighting for.” So it was. And so it is, together as one nation under God, indivisible. Let us join forces to fight the common foe of injustice and inequality, hate and fear. Let’s conduct ourselves as Americans who love each other, who love our country, who will not destroy, but will build. We owe it to the dead who were buried here at Gettysburg. We owe that to the living, and to future generations yet to be born. You and I are part of a covenant, a common story of divisions overcome and hope renewed. If we do our part, if we stand together, if we keep faith with the past and with each other, then the divisions of our time will give way to the dreams of a brighter, better future. This is our work. This is our pledge. This is our mission. We can end this era of division. We can end the hate and the fear. We can be what we are at our best, the United States of America. God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. Thank you. We can do this."
"119","10-08-20"," Please welcome to the stage, Vanessa Montes-Cazarez. Thank you all so much. It is an honor to be here today. My name is Vanessa Montes-Cazarez. I am the daughter of two hardworking Mexican immigrants who came here in search of the American dream. My mother is no longer with us, but very present in my heart. She taught me the value of hard work and sacrifice. She taught me to be a woman of faith and love above all. I grew up in Phoenix, Arizona, where due to the immense sacrifice of my parents’ hard work, I was able to attend board Bourgade Catholic High School, and I am a proud graduate of Arizona State University. I am a business owner. I own several small businesses, including Legends Event Center, one of the most popular venues in Phoenix, Arizona. If you told me earlier this year, just a few months ago, that I would be standing before you introducing you to the future president and vice president of the United States, I would have never believed it. This has been a hard year for many of us. In my industry, the events business, we have felt the impact of the coronavirus pandemic especially hard. My business was shut down for six months. We have only started hosting smaller events in recent weeks. Afraid for my family’s livelihood, it was a sacrifice we made to keep our friends, families, and communities safe from this virus, but it wasn’t easy. And while big businesses and corporations benefited from the government assistance and loans, many small business in our communities, especially the Latino community, was left to fend ourselves. Our restaurants, our clothing stores, our tech companies. We are the backbone of this community and this city. We’re proud to be places where our family and friends celebrate major milestones and spend their hard-earned money. We’re proud to be a place where hard work along with talent and innovation can come together to create jobs and help us build better lives. We know that President Biden and Senator Harris understand the value of hard work. They understand that my business is more than just where I work. It’s a part of who I am. They understand that we measure how good our economy is doing by how well our workers are doing, whether their wages are going up, and whether their families are able to save a bit to get ahead, and whether their kids have a better life ahead of them. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have a plan to help us build back better. We know what we’re getting under Donald Trump. No plan for COVID-19 and no plan to help us safely reopen our businesses. As small business owners, we now know the stakes in this election, which is why I’m so excited early voting started yesterday in Arizona. I saw people lined up before the polls opened to be the first among to cast their ballots. This choice has never been easier. I am going to be a first week voter to make sure my vote is counted for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. I am voting not just for me. I am voting for my whole family, for my six beautiful children, and for their future, for my fellow Latinos. There is so much on the line, but I have faith that we will elect the leaders that will restore the soul of our nation. As Mr. Biden says, ” [foreign language 00:05:50]. Together, we will build back better.” Ladies and gentlemen, it is my great privilege and honor to introduce to you two strong and outstanding leaders, Senator Kamala Harris and Vice President Joe Biden. Hey everybody. Hi. Where’s Vanessa? Where are you? Thank you, Vanessa. Thank you so very much for that introduction and for your leadership and all you do for the community here in Phoenix. Thank you. It’s good to see everybody. It’s good to be in the House of Labor. Earlier today, Joe and I had a chance to visit the American Indian Veterans National Memorial and pay tribute to the native Americans who have served our country in uniform. We were joined by the great Cindy McCain, a longtime friend of Joe’s and someone I greatly admire. And I was fortunate to serve with John McCain in the United States Senate and what an incredible, incredible American. He was a patriot of the highest order. And Cindy is supporting our campaign, isn’t that great? And she’s doing it because she knows that Joe and I will always do what she and John did, and that’s put our country first. So we thank Cindy. We’re so excited to be here in Arizona today. And later today, we’ll stop and talk with workers and small business owners who are working so hard and doing everything right, but still struggling to get by. They are who I was thinking about last night at the debate. This election, more than any other in our lifetime, will affect every part of our lives, with consequences that may last generations. And there is so much at stake. Our nation is at a crossroads. Just think, all at the same time, we are experiencing the pandemic, the recession, a reckoning on racial justice, a changing climate that’s battering our coastlines and setting the West on fire, and the future of health care hangs on top of it all, because you see President Trump is in the Supreme Court right now, trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. And along with Senate Republicans, he’s trying to jam through a Supreme Court Justice who will do exactly that, who will rip away protections from as many as 2.8 million Arizonans with preexisting conditions, 2.8 Arizonans with preexisting conditions. And while this president, of course, didn’t bring the virus to our shores, his reckless disregard for human life and for the wellbeing of the American people has allowed it to spread the way we have seen, and the casualties have been enormous. And so let’s not make any mistake. His refusal to contain this virus is what has wreaked havoc on our economy. And I know folks are hurting, but I also know this. We can overcome these challenges if we elect Joe Biden as our next president. And here’s the thing. Joe has had a plan for COVID at least since March. He’s been talking about this. He knows what this means and the kind of leadership that is required to get on top of it and get in control. Joe knows these things. Even, and you guys may have seen the debate last night, even when Joe didn’t have the briefing that Donald Trump and Mike Pence had on January 28th, Joe knew, because of experience, that this could be serious. And under his leadership, we will contain this virus and save lives and build our economy back better than before. Back better than before. Joe will be a president who restores the soul of our nation. He’ll be a president who creates good paying jobs and eases the burden on working families. And above all, Joe will be a precedent who unites the American people, Democrats, and Republicans, and independents, old and young, from all backgrounds and races, to meet the greatest challenges of our time. And I plan on being right by his side, and we’ll be ready on day one. We’ll be ready on day one. But here’s the thing, Arizona. We need your help. We’ve got only 26 days left. So let’s not wake up the day after the election on November 4th, wishing we’d done more. Let’s organize and vote in numbers no one has ever seen before. Let’s send Mark Kelly to the Senate. Vote like your life depends on it, because right now, it really does. And yesterday, Arizona, vote by mail ballots were shipped to homes across this state. And in-person early voting has started, including at the new McDowell Square voting center, just about a mile from here. So be a first week voter. A first week voter. And there are four ways to vote in Arizona. You can vote by mail. You can drop off your ballot at a dropbox. You can vote early in person, or you can vote in person on election day. And to learn more, go to, iwillvote.com/az and make a plan. Write down when, where, and how you will vote. And tell everyone you know to do the same, because Arizona’s future, America’s future, is in your hands. So let’s elect Joe Biden as the next president of the United States of America. And ladies and gentlemen, I introduce to you the great Joe Biden. Hello, Arizona. It’s great to be back. It really is. It’s great to be back. Thank you, Kamala. Thank you, [Vanessa 00:03:08]. Appreciate it very, very much. And we met backstage, and the first instinct we all had was to hug each other. And we went, “No, no. We got to stay 12 feet apart.” But folks, I want to give a special thanks to Ruben Gallego for being here. And you’re a big deal, man. I’m serious. And I notice he did something that… This is what we call, in our business, a busman’s holiday, coming to hear another politician speak, and having to put a tie on when he shows up without a tie. But thank you very much. I appreciate it, pal. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And the president and COO of the Southwest Regional Council, Pete Rodriguez. Not in here. Not here now? Well, also so Fabian Sandez, president of the local 1912. And you’ve all been with me. We were talking, Kamala and I, coming down the hall, and we said… Not a joke. It was just purely coincidental. She said, “I love the carpenters. DA. “… the DA in San Francisco, were the carpenters.” And I said, “I remember mine well, a guy named Cal [McCullough 00:00:15:29], president of the Carpenter’s Union from New Castle, Delaware, one of the 350 year old city on the Delaware River was the first one to endorse me as well.” And so, you’ve been with me my whole career, and president Doug McCarron has been a long time friend. We’ve worked together a long time. 520,000 carpenters. That’s an incredible army to have behind you. And you are, I’m telling you. You have, my whole career, and I hope you know I’ve had years as well. There’s an old expression when I was growing up in Scranton, Pennsylvania. It said, “You go home with them that brung you to the dance.” Well, the carpenters brought me to the dance, and you’re going home together. You’re going to have a seat at the table. Folks, people who shaped the skyline, who build the foundations, everything rely on, the carpenters. Labor brought me to the dance. And the only reason I’m able to run for president is because, standing here today, because of labor. I’ve never forgotten everything you’ve done for me and you’ve done for the country. I really mean it. I get in trouble for saying this, but it’s true. You’re the backbone of America. You’re the spine of America. You’re the ones who actually built the country, not Wall Street, bankers, and CEOs. You’re the ones who are going to rebuild it again. You’re going to build it back better, for real. Kamala and can’t thank you enough. And folks, I don’t know if you caught it, but the senator had a heck of a night last night. I tell you what, you got to give me a great credit for knowing how to pick them. Right? I couldn’t be prouder. She’s like a younger sister. I couldn’t be prouder to be running alongside such a leader with remarkable character and vision. And who always, always, always is looking out for the people, always somebody else, not her. Always. And I want to tell you something, Kamala and I are about to kick off a tour, visiting businesses in this community. Small businesses in this community and all communities are more responsible for more jobs than… In the community, local small business owners… They’re busting their necks, than the major corporations. You add it all up, for real. Small businesses create more jobs in America than the major corporate entities. And this community has found itself having to go through some really challenging times, and I need not tell the congressman that. He’s forgotten more about it than most people know. And like Chef Silvana. Chef Silvana owns two restaurants here in Phoenix. She had both. When they were struck by COVID, she had to close one of them down. And she’s working hard to keep the other one afloat, Barrio cafe, which we’re going to be visiting later this afternoon. But it isn’t easy. The loan Silvana was able to secure back in the spring because of the legislation passed by the Democrats in the House, helped her for a little while, but it wasn’t nearly enough. She’s scraping by week to week, trying to look out for her 10 employees, some of whom have been with her for decades. And on top of that, she’s facing, and I have permission to say this, she’s facing a terminal disease. Silvana had to cancel her own health insurance after finishing a round of treatment recently just to make ends meet. It’s devastating, and it’s heartbreaking, and it’s wrong. Every American should be upset about what Savannah is going through. I think you all are. I know I am. Because I know, we know, it didn’t have to happen. If they had just done what you passed, just move forward. And then, I’ll talk about it in a minute. But Silvana’s story is increasingly common story for Arizona workers and small business owners. Too many Arizonans are facing hard times right now. They’re trying their best, but it never feels like it’s enough. You’re not looking out for a handout. They’re just looking for a fair shot. Just want an even shot. That’s all they’re looking for. And that’s how my dad felt when he couldn’t find work in Scranton when coal died, he had to move on. I remember him taking us, what I call the longest walk any parent has to make up a short flight of stairs to tell their kid, “Honey, I’m sorry, but you can’t go back to St. Paul’s. You can’t go play in that little league anymore. Dad’s lost his job. There’s no job here. I’m going to have to move. I remember him taking us to our grandpop’s house. Me, and my brother, and my sister, and my mom was certainly going to have another child. And we all went home. I thought about how hard it must’ve been for my dad. So many people in this town have done the same thing. Have to go to his father-in-law, the father of four boys and a girl, and say, “I have to ask you a favor.” I know how much pride it cost him. “Can you take care of them for a year? I’ll be back. I promise. I’ll come home every weekend.” It was only 159 miles, but it seemed like the end of the world. But he went down, and by the time he was able to get a good job, a job enough to get us an apartment in a place called Claymont, Delaware. Because he had been raised in Wilmington, Delaware. He ended up, then, getting a good job, a decent job, managing a car dealership. He worked hard to build a decent middle-class life. And it wasn’t easy for him. He had an expression. He’d always say, and really, I mean this sincerely… He said, “I don’t expect the government to solve my problems, but I sure in hell expect them to at least understand my problems. Just to understand them.” And America, I think, deserves a president who understands what the American people are going through, who sees who you are, what you want to be, who cares about your health, your prosperity, your dream, your American dream. You’re facing real challenges right now. And the last thing you need is a president who exacerbates them, who ignores you. And I’m going to say it. I’ve been saying for a while. It’s my perspective from Scranton. A president who looks down at us, who thinks that if you put your life on the line for the nation, you’re a loser, a sucker. … line for the nation, you’re a loser, a sucker. As we were talking about with Cindy, my Beau, my son Beau who just passed, not just, passed away, now it’s going on five years, it seems like yesterday, won the Bronze Star and [inaudible 00:22:16] Service Medal. He was a volunteer. [inaudible 00:22:20] but he volunteered. He had to get an exception to be able to go to Iraq for a year. And I promise you, he wasn’t a loser. He wasn’t a sucker. He, like all the veterans we met with this afternoon alongside Cindy McCain, they’re Patriots. They’re people understand that being an American is about recognizing there’s some things bigger than yourself. Cindy’s husband, John McCain, who I had the great privilege of him asking me to do his eulogy, we used to argue like hell. We were like two brothers. We’d fight like hell, but we always, always, always ended up together. And that’s how it used to be. It used to be that way across the board. He wasn’t a loser. They’re all heroes. And you know what? They deserve better than a president who will say anything to deflect responsibility for any mistake he makes. I don’t know whether you noticed, he recently said that, they asked him where he got the COVID, he said, “I probably got it from Blue Star parents.” They’re people who lost a child in battle. He said, “Because they like to get close to me and hug me. I don’t know how to say no. Look, we’ve paid too high a price already for Donald Trump’s chaotic, divisive leadership. More than 210,000 Americans have lost their lives to this virus. We lose more every single day. Now, these 6,000 Arizonans have been lost. I mean, 6,000 gone, gone. More than 220, 000 Arizonans have been infected with COVID. 122,000 jobs in Arizona still haven’t come back. Nine times more Arizonans are on unemployment each week than before this crisis hit. But businesses like Silvanna’s restaurant are closing, schools aren’t back to normal, because Donald Trump can’t focus on what matters. When the House passed the so-called Heroes Act, that’s that second big package they passed to get people on their feet again some time ago, but the President and Mitch McConnell did nothing to move the legislation. A lot of cities and states are going bankrupt because they have to balance their budgets. Our founders are pretty smart. The reason they wrote the Constitution the way they did is the Congress, the Senate, the House, the government could deficit spend in order to compensate for being able to make sure we got out of the hole. Trump is spending more time, I’ve been calling on this, as you probably know for the last four months, he should get out of his bunker and out of the sand trap from his golf courses. Not a joke. I mean, think about it. He never once, I’ve been around a while, he never one single time tried to bring Democrats and Republicans together in the White House to try to get a settlement. Not once. You can’t name me a President in the lifetime of any of you that refused to deal that way in the middle of a crisis. But the leadership of Congress together to resolve the issue is something that wasn’t on his watch. And on Tuesday, Congressman, I’m sure you were probably not surprised by it, but on Tuesday he announced he’s walking away from negotiations to provide additional relief for working people, mom and pop businesses, schools. Just go down the line. On October 8th, exactly two months since the Emergency Small Business Program was closed, two months of small business owners in Arizona and across the country waiting and hoping for just a little bit of help to be able to stay open, more than 400,000 small businesses are permanently closed nationwide, 400,000, millions are struggling to hang on. The legislation has already been passed. It’s there. I handled what they called the Recovery Act when we inherited a great recession. I had the ability to deal with $800 billion spent in 18 months. All the outside groups pointed out less than two-tenths of 1% waste or fraud. But do you know what we did? We provided $ 148 billion to the cities and states so you didn’t have to lay off cops, firefighters, sanitation workers. You didn’t have to lay off nurses, close down county hospitals. You kept it open. And America got through it and began to generate the longest period of recovery in modern history. How many more have to go under? How many more dreams have to be extinguished because this President threw in the towel? Instead of focusing on your needs, he’s still trying to take away your health care. I mean, think about that. Just think about it. I’m not, but if I were a playwright, I’m writing a play, you’re in the single solitary outfit on Broadway that would take it, because it sounds like ridiculous fiction, in the middle of a pandemic, when already 10 million Americans have lost her employer based insurance because the employer went under, he’s trying to take away insurance from another 22 million people who got it for the first time in the pre-existing conditions that the Senator talked about. He’s in the Supreme Court right now asking you to strike down the Affordable Care Act, the entirety of it, take away Medicare benefits for seniors. People don’t realize how deep this goes, and taking us back to a time when insurers could deny coverage because of a pre-existing condition. I want you to understand this. Women’s rights, I’m not talking about the right to choose now. Women’s rights, do you realize, before we passed, Barack and I passed the law, pregnancy was considered a pre-existing condition. Not a joke. Insurance companies were allowed to charge more for a woman for the same exact medical procedure than a man would have. Same one. And look what’s happened. Minority communities were devastated. But he’s done beyond that. He’s vowed, and this isn’t even get much attention because so much chaos is going on, he vowed to “terminate the funding source for social security.” That’s the holding tax you pay for social security, six and a half percent. He wants to terminate it so it makes it look like you got more in your paycheck. But the actuary at the Social Security Department said, “If he does that, social security will be bankrupt by the middle of 2023. Benefits for more than a million Arizonans rely on the whole idea of a dignified retirement.” The fact is President Trump can only see the world from Park Avenue. He thinks that Wall Street built America. That’s why he let big corporations jump in on the front lines and get the recovery money that the Congress helped pass while small businesses struggled to stay open. But people don’t know because it’s so complicated, so much is happening. The Congressman can tell you. There was an Inspector General that they appointed, meaning somebody who had independent capacity to look into anything that was being done on the money being spent. I had an Inspector General overlooking the $800 billion I was responsible for. Twice every two weeks, I met with him in detail so we knew exactly where the money was going. What’s the first thing the President did? He fired the Inspector General. Think about that. 40% of all the money that was supposed to go to small businesses in the first time around went to the Mar-a-Lago crowd. The wealthy. I mean, if this wasn’t so true, I’d be reluctant to say it because it sounds so bizarre. This President has forgotten the people he said he’d fight for it. I’ll never forget because I see the world from where I grew up in Scranton and Claymont, a little steel town. I know that the middle class, working class built this country, and unions built the middle class. And I measure economic success on what families are talking about sitting around their kitchen tables, about having a decent job and benefits, about keeping their small business dream alive, about the conversations that took place this morning. But we need four new tires. The tires are bald on the car. We’ve got to wait. We can’t afford to get them. Can’t do it. Or you have 20 million people today, 20 million people including here in Arizona, who are worried about whether they can pay this month’s mortgage payment. 20 million. And look at all the people who are worried they’re going to be thrown out in the street because they can’t pay their rent. These guys provided for all that. But nothing. Being able to look your kids in the eye. My dad would just said, “Joey, a job’s about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in the community. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, ‘Honey, it’s going to be okay,’ and mean it. And mean it. It would be okay. And mean it, and mean it. Well, that’s what Kamala and I are focused on, to say to our kids, “Honey is going to be okay.” That’s what we’re talking about. We’re going to get this virus under control. We’re going to reopen safely and strongly creating good paying jobs and working to end this era of rancor and division. Because if we’re going to get anything done, we have to do it together. I’ve been saying this since I announced and people thought I was being naive. They said, “Oh, you got a lot of things done, Joe, before, but that was the past.” Well, guess what? If we can’t bring the country together, we’re dead. This is a democracy. It depends on a consensus. You’ve got to bring people together. It’s somewhat maybe presumptuous of me, but I made a major speech. I worked really, really hard on for a long time in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. And I did it two days ago. And I talked about, in Lincoln terms, that we have to bring America together. We can’t hold grudges. I’m running as a proud Democrat with a capital D, but I will be an American President, not a Democratic president. I’ll work as hard for those who didn’t support me… I promise you and look at my record… As those who did support me. Because the fact is that’s the job of a President. It’s a duty to care for everybody, not just who voted for you. After all we’ve been through, all America’s accomplished, all the years we’ve stood as a beacon to the world, we cannot allow ourselves to remain divided. We have the ultimate power in our hands. You know what that power is? That little sticker you have on, the power to vote. Really, you can still register here in Arizona to vote. Early voting has already begun. And the vast majority of Arizonan’s vote by mail. And those mail-in ballots will start arriving in the next couple of days. So Kamala and I are saying to you, the best thing you can do is return your ballot quickly. Don’t risk delays. Return that mail in ballot as soon as you can and make sure your voice is heard, because if your voice can overcome and go out and vote, your voice through your vote can overcome every one of the challenges we face. And by the way, you know what they’re setting up. They’re setting up the argument that these votes aren’t going to matter. You saw what happened today. The FBI arrested a group of militiamen who had a plan to go in and to kidnap the governor of Michigan. You’ll see it in the news tonight, the governor of Michigan. Remember those guys with the assault rifles standing in her driveway? And the President is saying things in my debate with him, like “To the proud boys and all white supremacists group, stand down, but stand ready.” This is serious stuff. We can’t just win by a vote. We’ve got to all turn out. We can be better than we’ve seen. We can be what we are at our best. If we all get out and vote. And on our best we’re the United States of America and all can decide. It’s not some prosaic thing. The fact is America’s never, never, never, never, ever failed. We’ve stood up together. We’re the only nation in the world that’s come out of every single crisis… war or economic crisis… stronger than when we went into the crisis. So folks, I’m more optimistic today about America’s chances at home and in the world than I’ve ever been. I’ve been around a long time. I’ve worked with a lot of Presidents. I really mean it. We have a chance. A chance not only to improve our country, but to change the world. We have the most powerful military in the history of the world, but that’s not why the rest of the world repairs to us. It’s not the example of our power. It’s been the power of our example that has the rest of the world follow us. And that example is being trashed around the world. As the Senator said last night in the debate, it’s true. 17 major countries of the world are asked what leaders did they admire the most and trust the most? The Pugh Foundation, I think. You know what they said? More people trusted Xi Jinping of China and Putin of Russia than the President of the United States. That was profound security as well as economic impact. So folks let’s not quit. There’s no quit in America. We have never, ever, ever, ever, ever quit. And if we need you to stand up at any time in our history, we need you now. Thank you for being here. God bless you and may God protect our troops. Thank you. They parked the bus inside. Thank you everybody."
"120","10-09-19"," … to cobble together a nation capable of self-governance, of meeting threats, both foreign and domestic. They knew, and we forget this sometimes, they knew that the battle for our nation didn’t end at Yorktown. At the time, one of the biggest concerns was that foreign nations would interfere in our democracy, in our experiment. That’s why we have an emoluments clause to prevent presidents from being secretly bribed or paid off by foreign governments. In his farewell address, George Washington specifically warned against foreign nations meddling in our affairs. Here’s what he said: “Since history and experience proved that foreign influence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government. We have to be alert.” Over 200 years plus has followed, and we have been consistent in our vigilance to keep foreign nations out of our elections. That was until President Donald Trump. Last week on the White House lawn, President Trump invited China to get engaged in deciding our election and who our nominee would be. He did it while standing in front of reporters and cameras, like I am this moment, in the broad light of day. There was a third foreign power that we know of that he’s asked in clear unmistakable language, clear unmistakable language, to interfere on behalf of the democratic procedures in the United States of America. Interfere with them. Quote: “Russia, if you’re listening …”, or quote: “I’d like you to do us a favor though,” end of quote, to the President of Ukraine. Quote: “China should start an investigation,” end of quote. It’s wrong. It’s the very thing Washington warned about, and undermines our electoral process. It’s un-American. Go in any city or town in this nation or your state, going to any schoolhouse, go into any town hall, any VFW Post, any football or baseball game, and ask the question: Is it okay for a foreign nation to meddle in our elections, to spread lies about opponents specifically at the direct invitation of a sitting president? The answer is obviously no. As Americans, it offends every bone in our body. The ballot box is sacred ground in America. That’s where we make our voices heard. That’s where we decide who leads us. That’s where we chart America’s future. It’s where we fulfill our duty as citizens. It’s not complicated. It’s called democracy. We believe Americans should decide American elections period. But Donald Trump will do anything to get reelected, including violating the most basic forms of democracy. It’s stunning and it’s dangerous because it directly threatens our democracy. This is not hyperbole. It’s a fact. No president in American history has ever dared to engage in such unimaginable behavior. With his words and his actions, President Trump has indicted himself by obstructing justice, refusing to comply with the congressional inquiry. He’s already convicted himself. In full view of the world and the American people, Donald Trump has violated his oath of office, betrayed this nation, and committed impeachable acts. To preserve our constitution, our democracy, our basic integrity, he should be impeached. That’s not only because of what he’s done. To answer whether he has committed acts of sufficient to warrant impeachment is obvious. We see it in Trump’s own words. We see it in the texts from State Department officials that have been made public. We see it in his playing much of the United States government into his corrupt schemes, individuals within the government, his appointees. But we have to remember that impeachment isn’t only about what the president’s done, it’s about the threat the president poses to the nation if allowed to remain in office. One thing about this president is absolutely clear, and I don’t think anyone can contradict this, he has seen no limits to his power regardless of what the Constitution says. He believes the entire United States government can be corrupted into furthering his personal political needs. He’s even willing to hold Congress and congressionally appropriated aid to a foreign nation hostage to his personal political demands. He believes if he does something, it’s legal, period. And perhaps most importantly, he believes there is nothing we can do about it. He believes he can and will get away with anything he does. We all laughed when he said he could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot someone and get away with it. It’s no joke. He’s shooting holes in the Constitution, and we cannot let him get away with it. Folks, we should have no illusions. We should have no illusions. This is a president who has decided that this nation doesn’t have the tools or the power or the political will to stop him from doing whatever he wants. Trump isn’t just testing us, he’s laughing at us. He has no sense of decency. He doesn’t care about the law. He doesn’t believe that people and nations that follow the rules are anything other than suckers or fools or losers. We have to prove him wrong. We have to demonstrate that our constitution, our government, our elected officials, including Republicans, are up to this moment. This is an especially dangerous moment for this nation because we know the pressure on Trump’s only going to increase. When that pressure increases, he’s only going to grow more volatile, more erratic, more self-serving and more destructive. He has another year in office. No, I’m serious. Think about that. Think about that. He’ll stop at nothing to save himself. No individual, no institution, nothing. Nothing that we’ve held sacred in this nation more than 200 years will be safe. If Donald Trump was just a reality TV star, it wouldn’t matter, but he’s responsible for the largest economy in the world. He’s commander in chief of the most powerful military in the history of the world, and he’s supposed to be a leader of the free world. Yet with the free world under threat of advancing authoritarianism, Donald Trump has completely abdicated America’s global leadership and embraced those autocrats. AT a time when China is engaged in human rights abuses that are staggering cause for enormous concern, more than 100 Uyghur Muslims are imprisoned in so-called “reeducation camps” in the West. In Hong Kong, protesters are increasingly being met with violent repression as they demand the democratic rights they were promised, they were guaranteed by us and the rest of the world. Does he speak out for human rights and stand for the people in Hong Kong, or the Uyghurs who are in reeducation camps? No. In fact, he promises to stay silent. Trump and his emissaries have sought repeatedly to extort the existential fears of Ukrainian leaders for political advantage, holding up political support of vitally needed military aid to pressure Ukraine at a time when it’s engaged in a live war with Russia. Most people don’t realize in the Donbass, in the West, there’s a war going on now, a war that’s costing thousands of Ukrainian lives. This isn’t a game. It’s deadly serious. The United States cannot afford to have a president who will abuse whatever power is available to him to get reelected, that’s what it’s all about. Here’s the kicker, the people around the president knew that what he was doing was wrong, profoundly wrong. So what they tried to do? They tried to cover it up by hiding the evidence, classifying it like no other president attempt to classify these conversations. We only know about this thanks to the courageous actions of a whistleblower who has since been joined by others stepping up to protect our country. Trump’s scheme has been exposed. Look, folks, Trump did it because like every bully I’ve ever known or every bully we’ve read about in history, he’s basically a coward. He’s afraid. He’s afraid. He’s afraid about just how badly I will beat him next November. Folks, he’s targeted me and my family with lies and distortions and smears. That’s all they are, because he thinks he will undermine my candidacy for the nomination as well as the presidency if I’m the nominee. He’s just flat doing what he’s always done, lying, even though the mainstream has called him out for his lies. Do you ever recall a reporter, a mainstream reporter, while a president is speaking, interrupting and saying, “He’s lying?” Maybe. I don’t remember. He’s spending tens of millions of dollars this early in the campaign to engage in the democratic primary to spread lies. He’s trying to orchestrate a campaign where truth and the facts are irrelevant. In Goebbels-ist terms, you say it long enough, often enough, people may believe it. And his lying is matched only by his manifest incompetence, this president. I believed it at the outset of my announcing that there would be no level to which he will not stoop. He’s insinuated that people who spoke to the whistleblower should be executed. Here’s what Trump said in a closed-door meeting with U.S. diplomats, quote: “I want to know who’s the person, who’s the person who gave the whistleblower the information because that’s close to a spy.” I’m still quoting, “You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart, right?” I’m still quoting, “Right? Spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now. What president has ever used such language? I mean, think about this, what president has ever used such language? Now, allegedly, I don’t know for a fact, the whistleblowers are worried about their safety thanks to our president. Shameful. It is shameful. He has no shame though. Trump even dared to say that if he was removed from office quote … I shouldn’t say quote, I’m not positive of the quote. I’ll be very precise, that it will spark a civil war. Dance in the streets. Right-wing media outlets are full of baseless conspiracy theories and the darkest reaches of the internet are awash with those vile attacks, and he’s spending millions of dollars right now, right now, of campaign money from his special interest groups who hate me and most Democrats to spread his lies. that’s what they are, they’re lies. There’s no truth in his charges and attacks against me and my son. Zero. Every independent news organization that’s reviewed his charges at length found them to be flat-out lies, and Trump knows it. But old method he has used very well since he was a businessman: Repeat, repeat, repeat the lie. My insistence that a prosecutor who was viewed as corrupt be replaced was the official position of the President of the United States, the United States government, supported by Republican Senators who sent a letter in 2016 calling for the removal of Shokin because of corruption, supported by the European Union, the International Monetary Fund, our allies, including the UK, France, Germany. What Trump did in Ukraine was to carry out a secret-"
"121","10-09-20"," I’ll tell you. And I asked her, “Is that my sister?” I said, “Yeah, yeah.” Look, the thing I love about being here, and it’s been about a year since September I was here last at this very spot, is the one thing we have in common. I mean, this sincerely. I first ran for the United States Senate years ago and I had one billboard. It said, “For all our families.” For real, that’s all it said. All my literature, “For all our families.” And the thing I love about you all, it’s all about family. It’s about family. It’s about family and faith and loyalty, and that’s what I think every time I think you here. And so I want to thank you. Now, I’ll tell you what, Edgar planned on bringing in 20 horses in here, but he couldn’t get them in today. Tell you what, I’ve had people campaign for me but never had them go through the neighbors with me on horses. But my dad, who was a real equestrian, would have really been flattered to know you’re doing this. Folks, look, it’s great to be back at the center and I don’t have to tell you all, there’s so much at stake. And here we are, we’ve gone through so much since I was here last, because of the incompetence of this administration. 210,000 people dead. We’re in a situation where that’s 40,000 Latinos nationwide, 40,000. 30 million people lost their jobs. Three million Latinos lost their jobs. One in three Latino businesses have closed, and the deep racial injustices that Trump continues to fan the flames of. It’s just wrong. We have to end this cycle where in good times, you’re being left behind. In bad times, you’re the first in trouble, and as we come out, always the last to come out. This crisis, we have I think though an enormous opportunity to build back better. I’m going to be very short, so I’m not going to keep you standing very long. Don’t worry. But I really feel strongly about this. I think we’re in a circumstance where you all understand it, but the American public is beginning to understand it. You are the core of the American story. You have a potential. You’re already an economic powerhouse, but the potential to lead the country in the 21st century into the direction that we need to go. You have close to 20% of the population in the United States, 24 out of every 100 kids in grade school through high school are Latino, and it’s ridiculous that we continue to policies that this administration has moved forward on and not embrace that and see it as our future. I’m not trying to be solicitous with it. I’m not trying to be nice. You are the future of the country. I mean, you really are. If, in fact, we’re in a situation where the Latino community in the United States of America and the GDP, the wealth that they generate nationwide, if we just took just the Latino population, you’d be the eighth largest economy in the world, in the United States. Why can’t we see that the future is just absolutely breathtaking if we just use our heads and begin to operate in a way that I think the American people are ready to do? The blinders have been taken off the American people. They get it. They understand. They understand that all those folks in the front lines, look at how many dreamers are out there risking their lives? I mean, you know it, but the American people don’t know it, and I keep telling them all over the country. The dreamers, there’s thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of them risking their lives, making sure that people are staying alive, they can stay home. And so, folks, look, we’re going to be in a situation where we can’t make this, we can’t do it without you all. We cannot win without the community. And I’m going to say something somewhat self-serving about you all. The fact is you can determine the outcome of this election, not just, not just for President, but for the Senate, for the Congress. And that’s the biggest mark, the single most consequential thing anyone can do is vote. And when you vote and they add it up and they see who delivered the vote, that’s the thing that guarantees significant input on what happens next. So folks, early voting starts. The clock is ticking. Voting starts here in just eight days on the 17th and I’d encourage you to tell all your friends. Go to Iwillvote.com now. Make sure they’re registered, their addresses are up to date on the ballot, and they have a plan to vote in the early voting right here, right at this spot. So come back next weekend, bring your family, and bring five friends. I really mean it. Bring other people with you, because he’s trying to scare us. He’s trying to convince everybody there’s ways they can play with the vote and undermine the vote. They can’t. If we show up, we win. And look what’s happened in early voting all across America. Long lines, long lines. We can’t just win, we have to win overwhelmingly, so he can’t be in a position where you can put the phony challenges that he’s talking about. So, folks, the American people, they’re the ones who decide our future, not this President and Attorney General, who is less than straightforward. You’re the ones. So let’s get out and vote. I know the sun is hot. I don’t want to keep you standing. And I want to thank the elected officials. This we call a bus man’s holiday. That means when a bus man has a holiday, he has the day off, the guy driving, he doesn’t get back on the bus. Well, these folks are all on the bus. They’re elected officials. They’re another elected official. I can’t thank you enough for your support. I give you my word I will do everything in my power to deliver on all that I’ve said. I mean it from my heart. You are family. Family and faith are what’s driven this community and is going to drive this country. And so, folks, let’s go get them. This is off. I guess I should have stayed where I was. My grand pop was not Hispanic. He was an Irishman. And every time I’d walk out of his door up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, he’d say, “Joey, keep the faith.” My grand mum, when she was alive, would yell, “No, Joey. Spread it!” Let’s go spread the faith, okay? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. By the way, I promise you, if I win, you’re getting an invitation to Washington, okay? Not a joke, not a joke. Thank you. You’re the best."
"122","10-10-20"," … a widow and a dear friend of an American hero, John McCain. We also saw the resilience and the goodness of decency of the American people. They’re not looking for a handout, they just want a fair shot. My dad used to have an expression when he lost his job up in Scranton. When I was in grade school, my dad would say, and we had to move in with my grandparents. When he went down south from Scranton to Wilmington, Delaware looking for a job. And he used to always say that, “The fact is Joey, I’m not looking for government to solve my problems but I hope like hell they can at least understand my problems.” He finally got a job, we could afford to buy a small home. He worked hard to build a decent middle class life. It wasn’t easy for him, but he had an expression. As I said, a job joy about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in the community. It’s being uable to look your kidney eye and say, “Honey, it’s going to be okay.” You deserve a president who understands what you’re going through. Who sees you where you are and where you want to be. The last thing you need is a president who ignores you, looks down upon you, who just doesn’t understand who in God’s name we are. That’s President Trump. His reckless personal conduct since his diagnosis. The destabilizing effect it’s having on our government is unconscionable. He didn’t take the necessary precautions to protect himself or others. And the longer Donald Trump is President, the more reckless he gets. Governor, you’ve seen how he picks fights with states and pits them against one another. Look, what’s happened. More than 210,000 Americans are dead. 420,000 have been hospitalized. We lose anywhere from 700 to a thousand people every single day in America, worse than any country in the world. More than 7.5 million Americans have been infected. And we’re still counting. And here in Nevada, there have been more than 82,000 cases in total. More than 1,600 deaths. 80% of those deaths have been seniors over 60 years of age. Black, Latino, Asian American, Native-American communities are especially hit hard. Nationally, the infection rate among Latinos is almost three times higher than that of white non-Latinos and the death rate as well as three times higher. More than 40,000 Latinos have died from COVID-19. My heart goes out to all those families who got up this morning and there was an empty chair around the kitchen table. Or go to dinner tonight and the person that should be there is gone. They’ve lost part of their soul. They’ve lost part of their life. It’s all about family. With you and I it’s all about family. Losing family is a devastating thing. We can do so much better. My heart goes out to everyone struggling with the economic crisis caused by the neglect, the simple neglect of this President. Nearly 11 million jobs lost since the beginning of this crisis. And they still haven’t come back, including 136,000 jobs here in Nevada. Temporary layoffs have turned to permanent layoffs. Record growth last month and a number of Americans facing long-term unemployment. And the problem of long-term unemployment, once you get beyond a certain point, history shows us that they never get a job again. All told, there are now 30 million workers who either lost hours, lost paychecks, or lost their jobs entirely. Roughly 700,000 people have dropped out of the labor force last month. And the vast majority were women. We’re still down 647,000 manufacturing jobs nationwide since the crisis has started. And our balance of payments deficit is going up. And here in Nevada, the unemployment rate is 13.2%, the highest in the nation because of President Trump’s negligence. The hospitality industry has hit particularly hard. The culinary union, has recently said publicly that 50% of their members are still out of work. Tourism in June was down 70% from a year ago. The result? President Trump will be the first president in modern history since Hoover to leave office with fewer jobs than he had when he came into office. Here in Nevada, after seeing over 200,000 jobs created in the last seven years of the Obama-Biden administration, Nevada has actually seen jobs go down under the Trump presidency. He’s leaving us with what he calls, he says is a V-shape recession. It’s a K-shaped recession where those at the top keep going up and the middle-class and everyone else keeps going down, getting worse. Means essential workers who sacrificed to keep us going through this pandemic are being left behind by the most unequal recovery in modern history. You get this, the top 100 billionaires in America have done pretty well. Just in the pandemic, the top 100 billionaires have made an additional $300 billion, top 100. But you get the bottom half of that K and it’s a downward slide. You’re left to figure out how you’re going to pay your bills, put food on the table. So much food insecurity in America, in this state. How to balance doing your job with being a teacher for your kids because of the negligence of the President, they can’t go back to school because they haven’t provided the wherewithal for schools to open. You’re asked to risk your neck because you can’t work from home where the risk of COVID are kept outside. That’s because you’re a police officer, a firefighter, a nurse, or you’re working on an assembly line in customer service or a checkout counter, or here in Vegas in hospitality. If you’re a housekeeper, a casino worker, the ones who built this very stage. Governor Sisolak, your members of Congress are doing everything they possibly can to help turn things around. Governor, you’ve been focused and responsible. You followed science and put public health and safety. You made tough calls that saved lives. Working around the clock so we can reopen schools and the economy safely. Your members of Congress, have done the same. And the House passed what they call the HEROES Act months ago. Would have provided billions of dollars to help states keep first responders on the job. The safety measures needed, the PPP needed to open our schools and businesses but Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell, Republican leader did nothing to move the legislation. Nothing in June, nothing in July, nothing in August, nothing in September, things getting worse and worse and worse. And as people struggled and suffered, what did they focus on? If this wasn’t so serious, you’d think I’m making it up. What they focused on is more tax cuts for the wealthy, not a joke. They’re proposal adds another $30 billion tax cut for millionaires and billionaires. Cuts in funding. Cutting the means by which we fund the Social Security system, leading the actuary of Social Security to say if they do it, by 2023, mid-2023, there’ll be no money for Social Security. And a relentless effort to eliminate, as Alejandro said, the Affordable Care Act, which provides healthcare coverage for 22 million people, over 100 million with pre-existing conditions. This is going on at the same time he’s already cost 10 million people their health insurance because their companies have gone bankrupt. It’s unconscionable. Instead of focusing on our needs, your needs, he’s trying to take your healthcare away. He’s literally before the Supreme Court as I speak to strike down the entire Affordable Care Act, take away that healthcare for 20 million Americans. That’s 282,000 Nevadans. Take away federal protections for preexisting conditions, 1.2 million Nevadans. And complications from COVID like lung scarring and heart damage could well become the next pre-existing condition. Striking down the Affordable Care Act would toss out the rule that allows our children to be covered on their parents’ insurance policy until age 26. Take us backward when insurance companies could change a woman more for healthcare than a man for the same procedure, just because she’s a woman. Take away Medicare benefits for seniors. Increase their drug prescription costs. And just as he vowed to “terminate” as I said earlier the funding for Social Security. The idea that in just a few years could put at risk 410,000 Nevadans that rely on a dignified retirement because of Social Security. And during all this, not once did President Trump call a high-level meeting of Democrats and Republicans to the White House to resolve these issues. I’ve served with a lot of presidents, never, no matter how good or bad you thought they were did they fail to try to bring parties together in the White House to reach a settlement. You know why? He spent so much time hiding in the bunker in the White House or on the bunker of his golf course, playing hundreds of rounds of golf. And then this Tuesday, what’d he do? He said, “End the discussions.” He wasn’t even starting them. No more negotiations. No more negotiations. And now today he says, “Well, I’m back.” One thing for sure, Donald Trump shows no urgency to deliver hardworking Americans, like the family I grew up in. Like all of you. What they need now desperately. For exactly two months since the emergency small business program that your congresspeople voted, for has closed down two months of small business owners in Nevada and across the country, waiting, hoping, for just a little extra help to be able to stay open. Now we have more than 400,000 small businesses have been permanently closed. By the way, the largest employers in America are small businesses. Millions more are struggling to hang on. How many more will go under? How many more dreams will be extinguished because of the selfishness of this President and the Republican leaders in Congress? Make no mistake, if you’re out of work, if your business is closed, if your child’s school was shut down, if you’re facing eviction, as millions are, over 20 million Americans worry about whether they’re going to be able to pay their mortgage next month. None of that seems to matter to Donald Trump. You’re a firefighter, police officer, who depends on state and local budgets. He’s turned his back on you as well, because they’ve got to balance their budgets. They’re being laid off all over America. When Barack and I were elected, we inherited the worst recession short of the Great Depression in history. He put me in charge of what’s called the Recovery Act. $800 billion. We passed and needed to get out into the economy within 18 months to prevent a depression. We did it with less than two tenths percent of waste or fraud. And I was able to see to it that the states in order to keep moving, keep teachers, firefighters, first responders, all employed. I was able to get $140 billion in aid out to the states. Right here in Clark County, I was able to bring to $1.2 billion to keep your economy going. We have that ability now. The House has already passed a similar piece of legislation. And we started the longest sustained recovery in American history. But you know what Mitch McConnell said about help with the states. I’m not making this up. He said, “Let them go bankrupt. Let them go bankrupt.” What in the hell is he talking about? Folks, we’re so much better than this. We can turn this crisis into progress. We contain this virus and fully reopen our economy. We make up 4% of the world’s population and we have 20% of the world’s deaths. If we just follow the science, expand testing and tracing, social distance, washing our hands, implementing nationwide mask mandates. Don’t politicize the race for a vaccine, Mr. President. Just have a plan for safe and equitable distribution. On the economy, bring the Congress back together to pass real relief to help people who’ve lost their unemployment checks as well. And then implement a comprehensive agenda that I’ve laid out to make bold investments so we can build back better. He keeps talking about the Republicans. Some Republicans, a lot of them are acknowledging and supporting me, but a lot of them also are talking about, “Well, Biden’s going to spend all this money.” Well, guess what? The independent analysis put out by Moody’s, a Wall Street firm did a detailed analysis of my recovery plan and the President’s. And here’s what they said, it’s off of Wall Street, that my plan will create 18.6 million jobs in four years. 7 million more jobs than the President’s plan. And $1 trillion more in economic growth than the President’s plan. Democrats know how to get things done. Here’s how my plan works. It’s not going to raise a penny in tax for anyone making less than $400,000 a year. Not a penny. And how am I going to pay for all this? I’m going to ask the big corporations and the wealthy to start paying their fair share. You realize that the Fortune 500 companies, 92 of them making billions of dollars, don’t pay a single penny in taxes. It’s wrong. Donald Trump paying $720 in taxes? Come on. The money we raise by eliminating the $1.3 trillion of his $2 trillion tax cut that affects the super wealthy and corporations, we’re going to invest in working people. We’re going to grow the middle class to make sure everyone’s included on the deal. The kinds of investment that will stimulate the economy, including industries like tourism and hospitality. To get back to full employment fast and help build back better than before. It means the analysis shows creating millions of good paying union jobs. Manufacturing and technology. Making sure our future is made in America. We and the President in the White House gives out $600 billion in contracts per year. Well guess what? While I’m President, it’s going to go to no outfit that doesn’t make it in America, the whole thing, and sell it in America. I mean it. And infrastructure. Building roads, bridges, highways, ports, airports, and clean energy. Upgrading four million buildings and weatherizing, two million homes, creating at least a million good paying jobs in the process. Making the climate safer, saving hundreds of millions of barrels of oil. We’ll deal with climate change by creating millions of union jobs that build a climate resilience of our cities and our towns fighting back stronger, more frequent wildfires. Beating heat waves, droughts, hurricanes, and floods. By the way, did you hear what the President said about hurricanes this summer? He was told about how they’re coming across the warm water in the Atlantic and the closer they get to the shore, the worse they get. You know what he said, Alejandro? He said, “Maybe we should drop an atomic weapon on them and blow them up.” As we say in my religion, “Bless me father for I have sinned. Under my plan, small business come out the other side of this crisis with access to capital and the ability to deal with their debts. We’re going to get $50 billion in new capital, especially for minority owned businesses and small businesses. We’re going to make another hundred billion dollars in low-interest loans available to these businesses, creating jobs, increasing economic growth and increasing incomes. A $15 minimum wage. I’m dreaming here. But a $15 minimum wage for our essential workers. We’re not just going to praise you, we’re going to pay you with a good wage. Ensure you have strong benefits. We’ll ease the burden of the major cost in your life. We’ll build the Affordable Care Act, writing knew health insurance options, not for-profit public options, which give private insurers a real competitor. We’re going to increase subsidies for premiums and lower your costs. Increase plans that will lower deductibles and lower out of pocket expenses. And we’re going to take on the pharmaceutical industry with a plan that will slash costs of prescription drugs by 50%. The reason I’m not going to more detail, you’ve been out here a long time, let’s give me one example. If in fact Medicare is able to negotiate for all the drugs they buy and say you’re not going to be able to sell them to them unless you pay the price we’re suggesting, that would drop by 60% the cost the cost of drugs. We’ll also make high quality childcare available and accessible. We’ll work with the states to ensure that every three, four year old will get access to free, high quality preschool. Not, not, not daycare. We’re going to make sure low and middle income families never have to spend more than 7% of their income to care for young children. Because if we truly want to reward work in this country, we have to ease the financial burdens that created the care for families that are caring for raising a child and an aging loved one. Look at the professional caregivers out there, home health care workers, childcare workers, who are more often women. Women of color immigrants, are too often underpaid, under seen and undervalued. That’s why my Build Back Better plan will elevate the compensation, benefits and dignity of caregiving workers and early childhood educators. We’re also going to triple the funding for Title I schools like the one behind me here, which served high number of children from low-income families. We’re going to make four years of public college and universities tuition free for any family that makes less than $125,000 a year. We’re going to make community college and job training programs free for all hardworking Americans that qualify. And if you’re buying your first home, we’re going to provide a $15,000 tax credit to help you get there. We’re going to protect Social Security. Increase benefits for millions of seniors. Look, I’m not going to lay it out, but go to joebiden.com. Go to Moody’s, look it up. We pay for all this and we grow the economy at the same time. The fact is, President of the United States can only see the world from Park Avenue. He thinks Wall Street built this country and CEOs. I see the world from where I grew up in Scranton, Pennsylvania and Claymont. Communities like some that you live in. I know the middle-class working people built this country. The measure of economic success has been what our families are talking about around the kitchen table. How many times do you know somebody… This morning I had to say, look, I know those tires are bald, but you got to ride on them for another 20,000 miles. We just don’t have the money. We just can’t do it now.” Who’s going to tell her she can’t go back to school because we can’t continue to borrow the money to keep her in that community college? There was a discussion that took place around my table and I’m sure yours as well. But if we’re going to get anything done, we got to come together. I made a speech I worked really, really hard on and thought really hard about before I made it in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, on the battlefield last week. I said at that time that we’re facing a crisis, not unlike we did after Gettysburg. I said there that I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I’m going to govern as an American president. The work is hard for those who don’t support me as those who do, because after all this country has been through, after all that America has accomplished, after all the years, we stood as a beacon of light to the world we cannot be that here and now, in 2020, we allow the government, the government of the people, by the people, and for the people, to perish from this earth. Folks, we have it our hands. And I made this in the bottom of heart, we have in our hands the ultimate power. And what’s the ultimate power in a democracy? The power to vote. Here in Nevada, the best thing you can do is vote early and return your ballot quickly. Ballots here in Clark County were mailed two days ago, on Wednesday. You can return your ballot by mail. You can drop it off at a drop box or vote in person during the early vote or on election day. But just make a plan. Seriously, go to iwillvote.com/nv. Make a plan. Don’t risk any delays, return that mail and ballot as soon as you can. Make sure your voice is heard. We can be better than what we’ve seen. We can be what we are at our best, the United States of America. I’m confident we can bring Democrats and Republicans together again with him gone. Folks, conclude by saying there has never, ever, ever been anything the United States has been unable to accomplish when we’ve done it together. Never, never, never. So folks let’s stand up and vote and take back this country now. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate it. (silence)"
"123","10-11-20"," Hello, hello, hello, hello. Thank you, thank you, thank you. It’s good to be back in Erie. I want to say hello to all of Erie. But mainly Mr.Mayor, City Council President Horton, and all local elected leaders who are joining us here today. And to your next Senator, Julie. We need to turn out and support for Democrats down the line here in Pennsylvania and win back that Pennsylvania state Senate. Folks, look. I want to thank you President McManus for coming out, you’ve been a good friend a long time. And for everyone at the UA for hosting this incredible training facility. I’m so grateful to have earned UA’s endorsement. You have over 355 proud plumbers, pipe fitters, and more behind me then I can possibly thank you for. Also, want to thank Rick for sharing his story with us today. And for being part of a conversation this year where he shared a story with America. And Rick, Delaware is thought of as being a great corporate entity, and chemical facilities, and all those things. But we have a $4 billion, as you probably well know, agricultural industry in the Delmarva Peninsula. It’s a big deal and a lot of farmers are being hurt really badly, really badly. Farmers all across the country have been gutted by the president’s broken promises and reckless trade war. But our farmers, just like our union members and anyone who actually does an honest day’s work, see him and his promises for what they are. Rick, I want to thank you. And I think you put it best in the op-ed you wrote last year. You said, “It’s a bunch of hot air and cold wind. Folks, this is it. Election’s here. The choice couldn’t be more stark. The stakes couldn’t be higher. So many Pennsylvanians are facing hard times right now. After my debate in Cleveland last week I took a train. That’s what I’ve ridden a lot, an Amtrak train. From northeastern Ohio into Pittsburgh and Greensburg, Latrobe, Johnstown. And I heard the same stories everywhere, I’ve been hearing all around the country. You’re trying your best but it never feels like enough. You’re not looking for a handout. You’re just looking for a fair shot. That’s how my dad felt when we had to leave Scranton after it was no work, when coal died. He was in sales, he wasn’t a guy who was in the coal mines. Although my great-grandfather was, they tell me, the first Irish Catholic State Senator ever elected in the state of Pennsylvania, and he was a mining engineer. But I remember him saying he made that walk, which a lot of you know here in Erie. I call it the longest walk any parent has to make up a short flight of stairs to tell his kids we can’t play in that ball camp, can’t play in Green Ridge Little League anymore. You can’t go to St.Paul’s, you got to leave. Dad doesn’t have a job. I’m going to have to leave. I remember him taking us home, my mom and three children at the time, home to my grandpop’s. And I don’t know how much pride it must’ve cost him to ask my grandfather, “Will you take care of Jean and the kids? I’ll be back.” And he started commuting every weekend 157 miles down to Delaware where he had grown up. We ended up in a steel town called Claymont, Delaware. Then we went to Wilmington. My dad got a sales job and he worked hard. Took about four years to build a decent middle class life and be able to buy a home. But it wasn’t easy for him, but he had an expression. He said, “Joey, I don’t expect the government to solve my problems, but I at least expected them to understand my problems.” America deserves a president who understands what people are going through. You’re facing real challenges right now. And the last thing you need is a president who exacerbates them. More than 210,000 are dead, as was pointed out. We lose anywhere from 700 to a thousand people a day, dead. The president was told a little while ago… When he was told a 100,000 people a day were dying, you know what he said? He says, “It is what it is.” Well, it is what it is because he is who he is. More than 7.5 million Americans have been infected, and counting. 175,000 cases right here in Pennsylvania. My heart goes out to all those families who, like any of us have lost a child’s spirit, look at that empty chair at the dining room table tonight where somebody you love used to sit. My heart goes out to everyone struggling in this economic crisis. Simple neglect on the part of this administration. There’re 11 million jobs lost since the beginning of this crisis and still have not come back. Temporary layoffs have turned into permanent layoffs. We’re still down 674,000 manufacturing jobs nationwide since the crisis started, and more than 40,000 manufacturing jobs here in Pennsylvania. The Trump presidency will be the first presidency since Hoover that is going to end up leaving office with fewer jobs than when he came into office. Since Hoover. But President Trump has laid… He talks about this V recovery. We went down real quick, we’re coming up quick. Well, that’s what you call a K-shape recovery. Those folks on the top of the K are doing very, very well. Recession at the top, those folks, everything’s going up for them. But everybody in the middle and below is going down, seeing things get worse. It means essential workers who sacrificed to keep us going through this pandemic are being left behind by the most unequal recovery in American history. And it means while the top… This is a fact, which is startling to me when I found it out. The top 100 billionaires, in the middle of this pandemic they made $300 billion additional dollars. Hear me now? 100 individuals made $300 billion this year. And what’d the bottom half get? They got the K, they got the slide down. Because the fact is, the President can only see the world from Park Avenue. I see it from Scranton. I see it from Claymont, for real. You all know what I’m talking about. You all see it from Erie. That’s why my program to build back better is focused on working people. Think about it. Think about all the people you know who got up this morning and had the following conversation. “Honey, I know we need four new tires, they’re bald. But we can’t do it now, we got to wait. You got to wait.” Or “I know we just lost our insurance, but we’re going to be okay. We’re going to hang in there.” Or having to make a choice, literally a choice, between getting the prescription or putting food on the table. If I said to that 10 years ago you’d look at me like I was writing a fiction story, but that’s the truth. Those are decisions people are making today, right now. Independent analysis put out by a highly respected Wall Street firm of all things, Moody’s from Wall Street firm, projects that my build back better plan’s going to create 18.6 million jobs in four years. That’s harder now. That’s not a liberal think tank, that’s Moody’s. And it’s going to create seven million more jobs than the president’s economic plan. And a trillion dollars more in economic growth than the president’s plan. And here’s how it works, I’m going to raise taxes. I’m not going to raise taxes on anybody making less than $400K, but you won’t pay a penny more. But those making more than that, I’m going to ask them to finally begin to pay the fair share. I’m going to ask the big corporations and the wealthy to begin to pay. 91 of the fortune 500 companies today pay zero tax. You hear me? Zero tax. How many of you pay zero tax? And billionaires are paying at a tax rate… Because it’s all investment money, they’re paying a lower tax rate than you pay if you have a job as a plumber. How can that be? So I’m going to raise. The money I’m going to raise, we’re going to allow us to invest in working people and grow the middle-class back, and make sure everyone comes along this time. My plan is about making the kinds of investments that are going to stimulate economic growth. To get it back to full employment fast and help us build back better than before. We’re going to create millions of good paying union jobs. I had the honor of being the guy in charge of the Recovery Act when the Great Recession occurred. The president turned to me, he used to love doing it at State of the Union messages. He’d never tell me what he was going to do. And he turns, says “And Joe, sheriff Joe’s going to take care of that $800 billion. Well, we got it done less than two tenths of 1% waste or fraud. And we built back the longest expansion in American history. Manufacturing and technology, making sure we’re going to make the future made in America. And infrastructure, building: airports, schools, affordable housing, upgrading the water and pipes. Making sure it’s sustainable and resilient, built, laid down by union plumbers and pipe fitters here in Pennsylvania and across the country. And clean energy, we’re going to upgrade four million buildings with weatherization of two million homes. And it’s estimated that’ll create one million good paying jobs, union jobs. Union jobs to be filled by men and women like in this local here. Look folks, we’re in a situation now where if you take a look at this build back better… I’m going to take a second. But I hope I don’t take too many seconds before it rains here. Number one, we were talking about it, Mr.President, a little while ago. He promised an infrastructure plan in 2016, ’17, ’18, ’19. He didn’t do a damn thing. Not one single bit. He promised to relieve main street slammed by the recession. But guess where that money went, that the Congress passed? It went into the Mar-a-Lago crowd, the wealthy. See, I’m not joking. It didn’t go to small businesses. It didn’t go to the people that needed it. My plan to revitalize American manufacturing infrastructure says we’re going to use by American. We’re supposed to be only buying American now. Well, I’m going to invest $2 trillion in infrastructure and clean energy. We’re going to raise over $3.7 trillion by eliminating that tax cut for the super wealthy. And folks, we’re going to: fix water pipes, pipelines, replace lead pipes, upgrade treatment plants. We’re going to construct 1.5 million new affordable housing units. We’re going to build a $100 billion dollars rebuilding our schools. We’re going to retrofit, which we started in our administration, 4 million buildings; including advanced heating and cooling system. There’s going to be such a race to job creation for unions that you’re not going to believe it, and I really mean this. And by the way, when I did the Recovery Act, which is $800 billion, not one… We had the largest infrastructure project short of Eisenhower’s Interstate Highway Program; since that. Not one single solitary dollar went to anything other than a prevailing wage. Had to be a prevailing wage. Look, I’m also going to make sure that corporate America being so kind, wanting to take over registered apprenticeships… You know what that’s all about? You guys spend a quarter billion dollars a year making sure that you have apprenticeships that are the best trained people in the world. Well folks, I’m also going to pass the PRO Act. They’re spending over $2 billion a year trying to keep you from being able to organize around the country. That’s a promise. And also strengthen labor standards, especially OSHA rules. There’s a lot we can do, but it’s not enough to praise workers. We got to make sure they get benefited. Folks, look, my dad had another expression. After he lost his job, we moved to Delaware. He’d say, “Joey, a job’s about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in the community. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, ‘Honey, it’s going to be okay.'” The fact is that every time the word climate change comes up Donald Trump thinks hoax. Every time it comes up, I think jobs. Let me be clear, no matter how many lies he tells, I am not, not, not banning fracking; period. We’ll also increase incomes. We’re going to see the burden and the cost with an increased 50, we’re going to make sure. Not prevailing wage. We can’t mandate that, you guys. By the way, I said inside, the other expression my dad had was, “There’s only one way to deal with the abuse of power.” Which corporate America is exercising now. “It’s with power.” And the only power we have is union power. You’re the guys that keep the ball bearings on the other side of the gate from taking everything, and that’s a fact. So look, I’ll try to move along quickly here. The fact is that we not ease the burden on the major costs in your life. What’s the average middle-class person fear most? They’re trying to tear down the Affordable Care Act. We’re going to build on it, adding a new health insurance option. A not-for-profit public option, which is going to give private insurers real competition. We’re going to increase the subsidies so premiums are lower and we can afford plans with lower deductibles and lower out-of-pocket expenses. Because we’re going to be able to do that with the money we take back from the super wealthy. We’re going to take on the pharmaceutical companies with a plan that slashes the cost of prescription drugs by 60%. Look folks, we’re going to work with states to ensure that every three, four, and five year old has access to free high quality preschool, not daycare. You send them to preschool, there’s evidence of 58% of them will go all the way through. No matter what their background. No matter what poor school, poor neighbor they come from. You start them at age three, they have a 58% better chance of graduating all the way through high school and beyond. We’re going to make sure the low and middle income families will never have to spend more than 7% of their income caring for their young. What’s the comp… Talk to the women around here. I was a single dad for five years. I couldn’t afford help. I thank God I had my mom, and my sister, and my brother to help me with my kids when my wife and daughter were killed. We’re going to make four year public college and universities tuition free for families making less than $125,000 a year. And when Erie gets his first new community college to open in Pennsylvania in 27 years, we’re going to make sure that it’s free for anyone who qualifies to get in. That’s a fact. And by the way, that costs a lot of money. That costs $6 billion a year. That’s about as much as we give a tax deduction for race horses. I mean this, we got to have priorities. If you’re buying your first home? Look at all people who’ve gotten out of school since the 9/11 generation. Where they got out of high school without a graduation. Where they got out of college, no graduations. Where they thought they had these good jobs waiting for them, but they all got shut down in the Great Recession. And now, what are they doing? They’re unable to make that first home down payment. They’re out there busting their neck. And a lot of them are college graduates, some of them are beyond that. Some of have their graduate degrees and no jobs, or no access. Well, I’m going to make sure you get a tax credit for up to $15,000 for your first time home buyer; period. That’s going to provide you a down payment. We’re going to protect social security, increase benefits for millions of seniors. So he can retire with dignity in some respect. Folks look, but if we’re going to get anything done, we’ve got to come together. We’re going to have to vote like we’ve never voted before. Early voting is open here in Pennsylvania. So go vote if you can. And go to IWillVote.com/pa to find out when and where you can vote early. And if you requested a mail in ballot, return it as soon as possible. Make sure you seal it first in the secrecy envelope, and then sign the declaration on the outside of the envelope before you return it. As I said early this week on the sacred grounds of Gettysburg battlefield, I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I’m going to govern as an American president. I’m going to work as hard for those who don’t support me as those who do. And I’m so proud in this campaign to have earned the support of so many proud and patriotic Republicans, including Pennsylvania’s former governor and secretary of Homeland Security, Tom Ridge. I want to thank him publicly for his endorsement. We may not in everything. We agree on this. This is a moment to put country above party. Because after all this country’s been through, after all that America has accomplished, after all the years we’ve stood as a beacon for the rest of the world. It cannot be that here in the year 2020 we’ll allow the government of the people, by the people, and for the people, to perish on this earth; as Lincoln said. We can do better. We can do better than what we’ve seen. We can be what we are at our best, the United States of America. All this division being pushed by this president, all this stuff about encouraging… Here in the debate we had I ask him to condemn the Proud Boys. He said, “Stand back and stand down, but stand ready.” What’s going on here? This is not who we are. This is not who we are as a country, for real. We can argue like hell, but end of the day we come together. I am more optimistic about America’s chances today than I ever been. Why? Because I think the blinders have been taken off, people have realized what’s really at stake here. I think we can pull this together. I’m optimistic. I really genuinely am. But here’s the deal guys, we got to go out and make sure you vote. Because, the only way we lose this is by the chicanery going on relative to polling places. This whole idea… Not a single solitary reasonable person in either party has said mail-in ballots are corrupt. No evidence, but he’s trying to make it sound that way. Trying to put people in polling places. The same guys you saw standing blocking people’s way in Virginia with banners and rifles slung across their shoulders. Folks, it’s not who we are. We’re so much better than this. So I say to you all, God bless you all. Let’s go out and vote. And may God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate it. Thank you. Where am I going? Am I going this way? Thanks everybody. See you pal, thanks a million. Thank you! The other way, [inaudible 00:20:11]."
"124","10-12-20"," It’s good to be back. Thank you. Thank you. It’s good to be back, Mr. Mayor, in this former terminal museum. I tell you what, this is a magnificent facade, isn’t it? I understand that a few marriage proposals were made by standing in that corner and whispering to someone in the other corner. Mr. Mayor, thank you for the passport into the city. Thank you for your friendship. I was looking around for it. I couldn’t see you in the light. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And thank you for… The Mayor is very good friends with a fellow who, one of the brightest, most decent men I know, who occupies my seat in the United States Senate, Senator Chris Coons. They were Truman scholars together. And you guys seem like you’re cut from the same cloth. Thank you very, very much for your support. I appreciate it, Mr. And Kate, you’re something else. Now, Kate, you know, there’s an old joke. A long time ago, particular senator said to me, this is back when I was much younger, I was in my second term, running for my second term. He said, “Joe, I’ll come to Delaware for you and campaign for you or against you, whichever will help the most.” My offer still holds. I hope my endorsement didn’t hurt you. But all kidding aside, Kate, we need you in the US Congress. And I really mean it. And the reason I say that is you’re a healthcare advocate, a cancer survivor, a mom, and we need leaders like you representing the people in the First District. People who understand what’s going on every day, the discussions that take place around the kitchen table in the morning. Our families are still struggling trying to figure out what to do. And Joyce, thank you for that introduction. Before I begin, let me say that I’m saddened to hear that one of my baseball heroes, Joe Morgan, second baseman, Red’s legend, Hall of Famer and a good man passed away. And my condolences to the Morgan family and his teammates and to his fans here in Cincinnati and all across the country. He played one year on the Philadelphia Phillies. Now, I’m going to get myself in real trouble, but I have a bad habit of telling you the truth. I happened to grow up in a household in Scranton, Pennsylvania, where, if you wanted to have dinner, you had to be Yankees fan because that was the farm called, the Triple A ball club was a Yankee ball club. And my grandpop was an All-American football player, but he was a great Yankees fan. But it wasn’t hard back in those days. There was Whitey Ford and a few others, but in Delaware, if you are not a Phillies fan, and let me put this way, if I were not a Phillies fan, I’d be sleeping alone. My wife’s a Philly girl. You think I’m kidding. I’m not. But Joe actually played for a year in the Phillies if my memory serves me correctly, but he had fans all over the country. It’s amazing to be both the heart when he was a second baseman, and the voice as one of the great baseball announcers in history, of the same club. I mean, that’s a pretty incredible accomplishment. And so, my best to his family and to his fans, and he has fans all across the country. Folks, as my football coach says, “Go time, Joe.” It’s go time. This is the most important election of our lifetimes, not because I’m running, because what’s at stake. The next president is going to determine not just the next four years, but what the next decade or more is going to look like because there’s such a stark fundamental difference. And you here in Cincinnati can make all the difference and all the difference in Ohio. I learned a long time ago coming out to Ohio that you win Ohio from Cincinnati north. Head north. Well, you are the starting gate, and I love being back here. And again, what a beautiful museum and terminal this is. I spent a lot of time, as I was telling the Mayor, in train stations. When I first got elected to the United States Senate, I was 29. I was in Washington and interviewing my first staff using Senator Kennedy’s whip office. And I got a phone call from a first responder saying my wife and daughter had just been killed, and my two boys were really badly injured, and not sure they were going to make it. My fire department, and God, I love my fire service, took about three hours and the jaws of life to get my kids out of the car because they were broadsided by a tractor trailer. And I didn’t want any part of going to the United States Senate. My sister managed my campaign, and my younger sister and my much younger brother raised all the money we raised, $187,000. We went to our governor to determine who would they pick in my spot because I didn’t plan on going. A lot of really fine men who were in the Senate at the time, and Republicans and Democrats came to me and said, “Just come and stay for six months and help us organize. And so I started commuting every day back and forth, and that’s how I got involved as sort of Mr. Amtrak. Because when they publish that, they keep fastidious records on how many miles you travel on government aircraft when your vice president. And I had traveled a little over, I think it was a 1,400,000 miles. It was on the front page of the paper, but I used to like to take the train home on Fridays still as Vice President because it costs a lot of money to take that small plane back. But in addition to that, the Secret Service felt much more secure if I wasn’t on a train, but they humored me and let me go home on Fridays sometimes. My mom was living at my home as she was passing. And I remember getting on the train and a guy named Angelo Negrea, I got to know their families, all the conductors and all the people all those years. And he came up to me and he grabbed me and he said, “Joey.” He grabbed my cheek. I was thought the Secret Service was going to shoot him. I said, “No.” I said, “He’s okay.” It’s a true story. And he said, “I just read, Joey, 1,400,000 miles on Air Force Two, big deal. The boys, we were checking. We had our retirement dinner. Went up to New Jersey for the dinner. You know how many miles you traveled on Amtrak?” I said, “No, Ang, I don’t.” He said, “Joey,” he said, “we figure 117 days a year, 36 years, and then X number of days as Vice President, you’ve traveled 2,100,000 miles on Amtrak.” I think I hold the record, other than a conductor. And so they gave me a key to the engine because I can… I’m the only one I know of. I’m not supposed to say that, but I got it hidden. My point is that, as a sidelight, one of the ways we’re going to revive this economy is we’re going to end up moving high speed rail and commuter rail across this country in a way that we haven’t done before. But the reason I went home was the same reason why all you do, or try to, and that is to be there in the evening when my kids went to bed. In the morning, my son, Beau, my son, Hunter, and my daughter, Ashley, get them back to school in the morning on the way to the station, and then when they got older, it wasn’t the case, but gets to kiss them goodnight. And as they kid, “I know, Dad, we got to say three Hail Marys and God bless our troops.” So for 36 years we did this, 250 miles roundtrip. … that travels with me, from repeating it, but as I ride home at night, and usually I could get the seven o’clock, the last fast train. Now they call it the [cell oh 00:00:11] . It was then called the Metro, was at seven o’clock and I’d ride. You get outside the Beltway exit and you ride by all these neighbors. I look into windows and wonder, literally sitting there, looking out the window. What are those parents talking about at that dining room table tonight? What are they doing before, they put their kids to bed, right after they put the kids to bed and come back and sit down. My guess is they’re talking about the same things that we talked about all across the country, and we’re talking about today. They’re asking questions, and one of theirs, as profound as they’re ordinary. “What are we going to do? Who’s going to tell her we don’t have the money to go back to that community college. Who’s going to, you got to drive another 1000 miles on those bald tires. We just don’t have the money right now to get four new tires.” This election is about answering those kinds of questions. Who’s on their side? My dad used to have an expression for real. My dad, he didn’t have work when coal died and Scranton. My dad was a salesperson. He wasn’t a coal miner. My great-grandfather was a mining engineer, but my dad used to say, “Joey, a job’s about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in the community. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, ‘Honey, it’s going to be okay’, and mean it. That’s a lesson I’ve never forgotten. It’s what I grew up with, surrounded by hard work and families and Scranton, Pennsylvania. When my dad had to move to Delaware, took us home to my grandpa for a year, but we finally got down. We got together again. That’s the discussions we had in Claymont and Scranton, like here in Cincinnati, but times are hard. Unemployment is up, due to the pandemic and economic outlook remains very uncertain and very mishandled. Across Ohio, and in this country folks are worried about making their next rent payment or mortgage payment, whether or not they’re going to be out in the street, whether or not they can purchase that prescription drug they need, or how much food they can put on the table. Making hard choices. Worry about whether the school their child is enrolled in, is going to be able to be open or what do they do if I still have a job, but I have a young child? If I go to work and their school’s not open, who takes care of them? How do we do that? They see the people at the top doing better and better, even in the midst of this God-awful recession, while they’re left to wonder. I mean, this sincerely, they’re have to wonder, “Who’s looking out for me?” That’s Donald Trump’s presence. 215,000 people dead from COVID-19. Experts are telling us, we may lose up to another 200,000 lives, by end of January, all because the president is only worried about one thing, the stock market, because he refused to follow science. It’s estimated that if we just wore masks, the mask I just took off to speak. Experts tell us, we could save between now and the end of the year, 100,000 lives. The president knew back in January. I think it was the 28th of January, when the intelligence community kept telling him how serious this pandemic would be. He knew it was extremely dangerous, an extremely communicable disease, airborne, but he didn’t tell anybody. But out of his desire to try to get Bob Woodward, to write something good about him, he did a long interview with Woodward, a famous journalist, and he went on record, on tape. He’s taped as saying, Trump is, that he knew how dangerous this disease was, but he did and said nothing except praise she, for the great service he was performing, how transparent he was. Ask yourself, why did he not tell the country? Or what, how much better off would it be, had he told the country. He said nothing. He told Bob Woodward, they didn’t want to panic the American public. Americans don’t panic. Trump panicked. Trump is the one who panicked, his reckless personal conduct since his diagnosis, as well, has been unconscionable. The longer Donald Trump is president, the more reckless he gets. Dr. Fauci, the most respected person in this area, in the country, referred to the president’s announcement event, for the Supreme Court in the Rose Garden as a super-spreader event, publicly criticizing him. How is the president of responding? He’s running a national ad here in Cincinnati and all across the country, quoting Dr. Fauci out of context. Dr. Fauci said, back in March, referring to public health officials, “I can’t imagine anybody could be doing more,” referring to public health officials. But Trump and his campaign were very much used to deception and not telling the truth. Deliberately lie by putting Fauci in his ad, implying that Fauci was talking about Trump, saying he doesn’t know how anybody could do any better. Fauci, after he saw the ad, he went public. You’ve probably seen it on the nightly news. He came after that and he said, “I did not get permission for that quote to be used, and it wasn’t about the president.” Even after he said that, and the point, I listened to your talk, even after he said that, look what happened. They continued to lie. They said, “We’re keeping it in the ad.” Same ad that says, I’m going to increase taxes on middle-class folks, with the same amount of credibility. Look, they use the ad knowing it’s a lie. Folks, we’re so much better than this. Despite the crisis we face, we have an enormous opportunity. Like America’s done, unlike any other country, after every crisis, we’ve always come out of the crisis stronger than we were before we went in. That’s the uniqueness of who we are. We now have an opportunity to build back and build back better, to get everyone a fair return on their work, an equal chance to get ahead, begin to reward work, not just wealth. For example, for communities of color here in Cincinnati and all across the country, the question is, “How do we break the cycle, wherein good times, they lag. … where in good times they lag. In bad times, they get hit first and hardest. In a recovery, they’re the last and toughest to bounce back. The answer is justice, justice, criminal justice, police reforms. I know this nation is strong enough to both honestly face systemic racism and strong on it to provide safe streets for our families and small businesses that too often bear the brunt of looting and burning, which is never justified. We have no need though for armed militia roaming the streets. We should have no tolerance for extremist White supremacist groups menacing our communities. Even reading what’s happening up in Michigan. The Governor is a good friend. They were in her driveway with assault weapons, standing there, because you can open carry in their state, attempting to intimidate. Remember, in, I was going to call it a debate, but the shouting match he engaged in, when he was asked by a Fox reporter, not a left wing somebody or other, would he condemn White supremacy, he never answered the question. I said, “What about those guys that you in fact talk about all the time,” those boys he talks about? He said, “Well, I would just tell them to stand back and stand by.” Neighborhoods I worked in, in the Black community in Delaware, that’s called a dog whistle. You say we should trust the American law enforcement authorities to their job as I do then let them do their job without extremest groups acting as vigilantes. If you say we have no need to face racial injustice in this country you haven’t opened your eyes to what’s been going on in this country and has for a long time. I decided to run for President and I hadn’t planned on it for real, but I decided to run when I saw those folks marching out of the fields in Charlottesville. Close your eyes and you remember what you saw on television? These White supremacist, Nazi sympathizers, carrying Nazi flags using the exact same jargon used, anti-Semitic jargon used as it was used in Germany in the ’30s, accompanied by the Ku Klux Klan and the Grand Kleagle saying, “This is why we elected him,” and a young woman ends up being killed. And I asked the President, “What do you think?” He said something no President has ever said, mark it down, ever said, “There are very fine people on both sides. There have been very powerful voices for justice in recent weeks and months. I’ve spent some time more, than one time, with George Floyd’s family and his little daughter, Gianna. And I knelt down to say hi to her and she said in a soft voice, “Daddy,” my word, this is a quote, “Daddy changed the world.” I also got to know Jacob Blake’s mom and dad and the whole family. Know what she said, she said, “Violence didn’t reflect her son,” that this nation needed healing, to stop the rioting, peacefully march, but there’s no justification for violence. One of the things that I’ve found, I’ve been in the civil rights arena for a long time and found pretty moving, was Doc Rivers, the basketball coach choking back tears. Remember what he said a couple of weeks ago? “We’re the ones getting killed. We’re the ones getting shot. We’ve been hung,” continuing the quote. “It’s amazing why we keep loving this country and this country doesn’t love us back. Think about that. Think about what it takes for a Black person to love America. That is a deep love for this country that for far too long has never been fully recognized. Trump talks about the lack of systemic racism and this is the first administration we’ve never met, “We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men,” we’ve never met that standard. But every generation has moved closer and closer and closer to inclusion. It’s the first one, elected President, to deliberately try to turn it back in a big way. With all due respect, I think we need in America’s leadership that seeks to deescalate tensions, open the lines of communication, and bring us back together to heal and to hope. As President, that’s precisely what I will do. That’s a President’s job, but it just goes beyond the issue of police-community relations. It goes about being able to compete and build wealth. It’s about jobs, good paying jobs, financial stability, families of color building wealth, and being able to pass it down, like my Irish-Catholic folks were able to do in Scranton, coming up from nothing. You build home equity, you got something to pass on. For example, another example is more and more women are dropping out of the workforce in this recession whether they’re in a city or in the suburbs. I have a plan to deal with this pandemic responsibly. Testing, tracing, masking, not politicizing the race for a vaccine, a plan for its safe and equitable distribution, providing funding for PPE, the protective equipment and other resources for schools and businesses to be able to reopen safely. If you notice, the president said, when he was asked about his responsibility, he said, “I take no responsibility.” That was a quote. ” I take no responsibility. No national standard has been set by this administration. Mr. Mayor, you’re doing on your own, or with your Governor or others in the community. We have to do so much and we can do so much. Ease the caregiving crisis for so many families experiencing now. That squeeze between raising your kids while caring for an aged loved one. It’s real. Protect your healthcare in the middle of this pandemic. Why do so many Republicans today have time told a hearing on the Supreme Court with 22 days left to go instead of providing significant economic recovery and needs for the people who are hurting so badly, Democrats and Republicans? Think about that. I handled the Recovery Act for our administration. $800 billion in 18 months with less than two-tenths of 1% waste or fraud. We had an Inspector General who looked over everything I did and I met with once every two weeks. … billion dollars out to state and locality. So you didn’t have to lay off cops, firefighters, school teachers, nurses, first responders. What are we doing? Zip. The house acted, in the beginning of the summer, the so-called Heroes Act, to pay for all of this. States are in trouble. I’ll tell you why they’re not doing anything about it; two reasons. One, it’s all about wiping out the Affordable Care Act, which has been an obsession for this president since he became president. It was an Obama idea. Because no other nominee has said in the past that the law should be struck down. Not as a judge, [inaudible 00:00:27:59], that’s her view. That’s going to take health care coverage away from 20 million Americans. Because of his mishandling the economy and COVID, we’ve already lost 10 million people, have already lost their employer based health insurance, 10 million. That’s going to take away pre-existing conditions coverage for a hundred plus million Americans. And complications of COVID- 19 like lung scarring as well as heart damage, could well put how many millions more? There’s over 7 million people contracted COVID in the United States. What happens then? Pre-existing conditions can not be covered. It’s going to toss out the rule that allows children to be covered on their parents’ health care until age 26. It’s going to take us backwards. When insurance companies could charge a woman more for the same exact treatment that they charge a man. And pregnancy, once again, becomes a pre-existing condition. Folks, we can do so much better than this. Together we can build on the Affordable Care Act, writing a new health insurance option, a nonprofit public option, which is giving private insurers, a real competitor. Increase the subsidies, so premiums are lower and you can afford plans with lower deductibles, and lower out-of-pocket costs. We can only do any of this, if the country comes together. Last week, I went to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, to the battlefield where Abraham Lincoln told us that a house divided cannot stand. Today, trust is ebbing, hope seems elusive. Instead of trying to heal his policies are ripping us apart. And those Republicans are willing to cooperate, get punished by this president. I refuse to let that happen. We need to revive the spirit of bipartisanship in this country. I know that sounds bizarre in light of where we are. The spirit of being able to work with one another. When I say that, and I said that from the time I announced, I was told that, “Maybe that the way things used to work, Joe, you got a lot done before Joe, but you can’t do that anymore.” Well, I’m here to tell you and say we can, and we must, if we’re going to get anything done. Democracy requires consensus. I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president. There will be no blue states and red states with me. It’s one America. I’ll work with Democrats and Republicans. I’ll work as hard for those who vote against me, as those who voted for me. That’s the job of a president, the duty to care, to care for everybody. We can disagree on policy, but you can still care. And you too have a sacred duty, in my humble opinion. As my friend, John Lewis said before he died, and while he was alive, “You have a sacred obligation to vote.” It matters. Ohio matters. You elected me and Barack in 2008 and 12. I’m asking for your support. I want to earn it, I’ll take nothing for granted. Asking for your support for Kamala and me in 2020. I promise we’ll always have your back. So please vote. Go to, I Will Vote.com/OH, now, to request your absentee ballot to vote by mail, to confirm your early voting location, to vote early in person, to find your polling place to vote in person on election day. Just make sure you have a plan. As a future congress woman said, “Bring along family, bring long friends, make their plans to vote as well.” No matter what, don’t let anybody discourage you and tell you your voice won’t be counted. It does. And don’t be intimidated by talk of having some of these Proud Boys stand there with their rifles in lines where you can open carry to try to intimidate people without saying anything. You, the American people decide our future; vote. And I’m convinced you’re going to turn out in large numbers. When I announced, I said I was running to restore America’s soul. Well its time to restore it. So it’s time to rebuild the backbone of this country, the middle class. This time, bring everybody along. No matter your race, your age, your gender, your religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability; everybody gets to come along. It’s time to unite America. And we’ll do that by choosing hope over fear, science over fiction, truth over lies, and unity over division. There’s nothing beyond the capacity of this nation when we stand together. So it’s time to stand up, take back our democracy, unite. And let’s, for the first time in a while, reflect the values that the vast majority of Americans hold. May God bless you. And may God bless our troops. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."
"125","10-13-20"," Even when Trump manages to respond to this crisis, he’s put seniors in more danger. About one and three older Floridians rely on Social Security as a sole source of their income and over four and a half million count on Medicare, yet Donald Trump’s executive orders threaten the survival and stability of these critical programs. Make no mistake. Neither of these men will walk into the White House without the blessing of Florida’s seniors. Right. Right. Yes. There’s no question about that. Much has made in the rise of the youth vote, and thank God for it, but it is residents who are 65 and older who still swing elections here in the Sunshine State. There’s no doubt about that. The road to the White House travels through Florida, and about three-quarters of our seniors turn up at the polls every single election. While Trump closes down the government’s pandemic strike force, lies to Americans about the threat that it poses, or pushes another quack cure, Joe Biden actually has a plan to get COVID-19 under control. For the long-term security of our seniors, Joe Biden has a plan that actually strengthens Social Security compared to just a few weeks ago when shockingly Donald Trump made it clear he would shred the funding mechanism for this vital safety net for our seniors. You just can’t make this stuff up. This man wants to try to win Florida, and he would shred that vital safety net. Joe Biden rightly says, “This is a battle for the soul of our nation.” There is no question about that. In that battle, Joe Biden will not allow vital programs like Social Security fall victim to this virus. It is the lifesaving program for millions of American senior citizens. Let me be very clear, Joe Biden won’t sacrifice Social Security or threatened the future of Medicare to slay this virus like Trump has already proposed. Joe Biden will protect social security with all the political muscle he can muster. The inadequate response to the coronavirus pandemic has caused a crisis in our nursing homes and long-term care facilities. As Trump continues to sit on his hands, Joe Biden released a plan to increase safety, oversight, and transparency so our loved ones can be cared for with the dignity that they deserve. When it comes to protecting Medicare or lowering prescription drug costs, you know Joe Biden will go to bat for Florida seniors because he’s done it all his life. Protecting seniors isn’t just some reality show gimmick that Joe Biden trots out for cameras one day and then moves on from the next day. Protecting seniors is who Joe Biden is. It’s who he’s always been. From The Villages in Central Florida to Century Village, Sunrise Lakes, and Kings Point here in Broward County, in their heart of hearts, our seniors know that they can truly count on Joe Biden. They can count on Joe Biden to protect Social Security, to serve Medicare, and make their medications less expensive and more affordable, and deep down, seniors know they can count on Joe Biden to take down this virus and safely reunite them with their friends, children, and grandchildren. Florida’s seniors know they have a friend and ally in Joe Biden because he’s always stood by them, and even in a crisis like this one, he’ll never leave their side. That trust will show itself on election day. It already is. I just know it. 21 days, my friends. Onto victory for Florida, for Florida’s seniors, and for all of America. Thank you so much. Please welcome former Weston City Commissioner Toby Feuer. Hello, Broward County. My name is Toby Feuer. I was born in the Bronx. I grew up in New York City. I got married and had two wonderful children. I worked for 25 years at Brooklyn College in administration and moved here to Broward County in 1998 to allegedly retire. Well, it wasn’t much of a retirement for me. I immediately became involved with my condo association and local community, and I served eight years on the Weston City Commission. I like to call myself a professional volunteer. I work with ORT America, the Weston Music Society, Weston Friends of the Library, Hadassah, and the American Association of University Women to name just a few. In short, I like to stay busy. We always hear people say, “This is the most important election of our lifetime,” but for Florida seniors, this really is the most important election we will ever vote in. Like so many seniors, I paid into Social Security for my entire life, and I planned my retirement around that income, but now Donald Trump is threatening to defund Social Security. Some of my neighbors depend on Social Security as their sole source of income, and for a president to break his promise to us unconscionable, especially now in the middle of a pandemic. Before COVID-19, my weeks with jammed with so many things: meetings, social gatherings, trips, and so much more, but then everything changed. COVID-19 has turned my life upside down. Meetings are over Zoom now. I try to keep in touch with friends over the phone, but it’s simply not the same. I am incredibly fortunate to be living with my daughter who works from home, but I don’t ever leave my house unless it’s to purchase groceries and essentials every two weeks. The simple truth is it didn’t have to be this bad. None of us want to live our lives at home in front of a computer screen, and if Donald Trump hadn’t lied to us, and if he had decided to take this virus seriously, things might be different for Florida seniors. But this administration has written seniors off as expendable. Well, guess what? We aren’t, and we vote. The president has been a disaster for seniors. We deserve better. We deserve a leader who cares about us. I know Joe Biden will look after us. I know Joe will protect and strengthen Social Security, and I know he will lower the cost of prescription drugs. I know that he has a real plan to beat COVID-19 so that our friends and neighbors, we could see them again, our kids, our grandkids, and get life back to normal as soon as possible. Joe Biden will always fight for seniors. That’s why I encourage you and ask you to please get out to vote either by mail or in person for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to be our next President and Vice President of the United States. Thank you so much. Please welcome the next President of the United States, Joe Biden. Yeah. Hello, hello, hello. [inaudible 00:09:11]. Good to see you all. Please, please, take a seat if you have one. Thank you so very, very much for… It’s good to be back in Florida. I want to thank my good friend Debbie Wasserman Schultz, congresswoman. She’s been a tireless fighter. Where’s Debbie? There she is. Thank you, Debbie. You’ve been a friend a long time, and thank you for all the encouragement. Toby, I also want to thank you. Toby moved from a high rent district in Brooklyn. That’s the highest rent district in America right now these days. [inaudible 00:09:48], good to see you. I want to thank you for that kind introduction. It’s wonderful to be here with all of you to hear the stories, talk about how we’re going to get through these tough times, the difficult times. … tough times and difficult times. Today’s story is a familiar one here in South Florida. We’re all living in some version of it right now with some of the most important parts of our lives being put on hold and the same story being lived by people like Carl Schechner, who many of you know well. Carl’s here today, I’m told. Hey Carl. How are you, man? Good to see you. The light was shining right in my eyes looking at you, man. I apologize. Carl is 39 years old. No, 93 years old, but he acts like he’s 39 years old. And the pillar of this community. So much so that a few years back, you all decided to rename this community center in his honor. I’ve heard wonderful things about you, Carl, and looking forward to saying hello to you privately. I had the pleasure of meeting Carl back in 2012. He may not remember it, but his story is what this community and this country is all about. Carl is a son of an immigrant. Carl served our nation honorably in the second World War and met his sweetheart, Anita, when they were … They’ve been married now for 67 years. Together, they built a family, four children, seven grandchildren. And more than 30 years, they made home here, staying engaged in all the local issues and holding local office, catching Sunday matinees and performances at the arts center and socializing with neighbors, enjoying nights in the town. And a couple of times, two, three times a week, going out. But their story, like so many others, is a quintessential American story these days, but it has been interrupted this year. Carl and Anita haven’t been out, I’m told, to a restaurant in seven months and there are no more Sunday matinees. Other than getting groceries, they spend most of their time in their apartment like so many people do. It’s harder than ever to spend time with the people you love, other than on Zoom or on a computer connection. We’ve all felt that sense of interruption in our lives. And we all know that this isn’t normal, that things didn’t have to be this bad. They didn’t have to be this bad. We look around at our neighbors and we know people are hurting. A lot of folks are worried about making their next rent payment, their next mortgage payment, whether or not they can purchase their prescription drugs or put food on the table. That’s been the entire story of my view of Donald Trump’s presidency. The fact that he’s never been focused on what matters. He’s never been focused on you. His handling of this pandemic has been erratic, just like his presidency has been. And it has prevented Florida’s seniors and people all across the country from getting the relief that they need. Donald Trump hasn’t just been willing to not do the work. I think it’s beyond that. I’m not sure he cares about delivering any real help. I think it’s both. People say he’s not willing to do the work. Well, I don’t think he cares much about it. While you’re losing precious time with your loved ones, he’s been stuck in a sand trap in one of his golf courses. And when he does decide to lift a finger, it doesn’t help you. It’s to propose new tax cuts for billionaires, and that’s not hyperbole. That’s not hyperbole. 100 wealthiest billionaires in America are expected to get another $30 billion tax cut he’s proposing. We know what happened the last time a tax cut was passed in 2017 when he came into office. Pharmaceutical companies got billions of dollars in tax breaks, and then they turned around and raised prices for medicines that you rely on to stay healthy. And they’re still doing it even during the pandemic. And quite frankly, it’s unconscionable. But Trump doesn’t really care about lowering the healthcare costs because he’s beholden to the health insurance companies and the drug companies. After all, he’s asking the United States Supreme Court as I speak, he’s asking them right now to strike down the entire Affordable Care Act, which would eliminate seniors’ ability … Most of you are on Medicare, but it would eliminate your ability in that act we passed, I was able to help put in place, was that you’d have preventative services and annual checkups and mammograms for free under Medicare. If it gets struck down, that gets wiped out as well. The rise in prescription drug prices for millions of seniors put Medicare trust fund at risk. And by the way, we used to talk about the Medicare trust fund. I say the Republicans want to eliminate it. But remember, Debbie will remember when, he’s not a bad guy in terms of his personality, but when the former Speaker of the House became Speaker, what’d they do? They proposed a half a billion dollar cut in Medicare from the start, right off the bat. These guys mean what they say. This President, as Debbie pointed out, has pledged to terminate the tax that’s dedicated to financing social security. Terminate it. A social security actuary, not Joe Biden or a liberal think tank or a newspaper. The actuary, the social security says, that would bankrupt social security in just a few years, putting those monthly checks for tens of millions of seniors that they rely on, and many of them, the only thing they rely on, at risk. All this president knows how to do is play games with people’s lives and families’ futures. Last week, he announced he was “walking away from the negotiations” that he never fully engaged in. He’s not walking away. He never fully engaged in them. To provide any additional relief for American families. Debbie, working like the devil in the house, they passed the HEROES Act. They passed two other pieces of legislation earlier to provide for the ability to keep people from going out of business, people being kicked out of their homes, et cetera. He turned his back on small businesses that are struggling to keep their doors open. He turned his back on firefighters and police officers and first responders who depend on local budgets, but local budgets are being broken and they have to be balanced. I’ll just make note here. When we inherited the largest recession, the greatest recession since the depression, what happened? President put me in charge of the Recovery Act, $800 billion. First thing I was able to do, and I was able to manage it myself, was I put $147 billion to just help state and local authorities be able to balance their budgets, not have to fire police officers, not have to fire firefighters, not to fire first responders, not have to close down health clinics. Local governments are strained to the breaking point. He turned his back on educators and school children, standing in the way of support to get them PPE and cleaning supplies and ventilation needed to reopen schools safely, which we could do if we funded it. He turned his back on every single worker whose job hasn’t come back. And now he says he wants a deal. One day he’s tweeting that the relief package is too big. The next day saying it’s too small. It’s all game. He thinks he’s still on his game show. No really. He acts that way. For real. This is a political game he’s playing. His latest gimmick, he wants to mail seniors a $200 prescription drug cash card with his name on it. So you’re going to get it before election with his name on it. But what are you going to do? He’s going to raid Medicare trust fund to pay for that $200, which seniors have already spent by paying money into. He thinks that he can take the money out of your pocket with one hand and put it back with his name stamped on it in the other hand and call it a gift. It’s dishonest. It’s reckless. And it doesn’t actually help anybody. In fact, all it will do is undermine the Medicare trust fund and increase overall out-of-pocket costs for seniors. Let’s be clear about this. Donald Trump has tried for almost four years, he says he wants to lower the drug price. Okay? But he hadn’t done a single thing to do it. In fact, the House of Representatives passed a bill that Debbie supported that would bring down prescription drug costs across the board, giving Medicare the power in Washington, Medicare department, the power to negotiate with the drug companies and say, “If an aspirin is going to cost, if we’re being charged …” I’m making this up. “If an aspirin is going to cost two cents an aspirin,” they said, “We’re only going to pay you a penny an aspirin.” They’re either going to do it or not. They’re going to have to do it. We’ve been fighting to get, Debbie and I and others, have been fighting to be able to do this for years. It would lower drug prices. What did President Trump do? He said, “If it passes, he’ll veto it.” Threatened to veto it. Folks, Donald Trump’s chaotic and divisive leadership has cost us far too much. 215,000 deaths from COVID-19 and rising. Experts say we’ll lose nearly another 200,000 lives in the next few months unless we fundamentally change courses. You know, I prayed for his recovery when he got COVID and I’d hoped at least he’d come out of it somewhat chastened. But what has he done? He’s just doubled down on the misinformation he did before and making it worse. He’s just doubled down on the misinformation he did before and making it worse. So many lives have been lost unnecessary because this President cares more about the stock market than he does about the well-being of seniors. One day before we crossed the threshold of 200,000 deaths, you may recall this, the President was at the campaign rally and insistent that the virus was, and I quote, “Affects virtually nobody, just elderly people with heart and other problems.” Nobody. Think about that. Who was he talking about when he said it infects virtually nobody? He was talking about America’s seniors. He was talking about you. He was talking about my family. You’ve worked hard your whole life contributing to society, building a family, building the country, serving America. You deserve security. You deserve respect and peace of mind, but you’re not getting it. And by the way, if this wasn’t so bizarre, if I tried to make a movie talking about something like this in America, you’d think I was making it up. Because Donald Trump, it’s simple, not a joke, you’re expendable. You’re forgettable. You’re virtually nobody. That’s how he sees seniors. That’s how he sees you. It’s no surprise this is the same man that looks at Americans who put their lives on the line like you did, sir, and many others maybe in this room, for our nation and calls them losers and suckers. I carried this card with me every day for the last 15 years. It’s my schedule. In the back of this schedule, I have a black box. It says, “Daily troop update.” The number of troops who died in Iraq and Afghanistan, 6,924. Not roughly 6,900, 924 because every one of these fallen angels that left a family behind deserves to be remembered. Everyone. US troops wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan, 53,000, as of today, 194. Everyone with only one sacred obligation, America, to care for those we send a war and equip them when they come home and take care of them and their families. And what did he say? Losers. My son volunteered to go to Iraq for a year. Before that, he had been in Kosovo for eight months. Best of my knowledge, the only foreigner who has a war monument and a major highway in that country named after him for his contribution to helping them set up their criminal justice system, then he volunteered to go to Iraq as attorney general for a year. My son was not a loser. And all of those left behind, he’s passed away, but all those left behind, they were heroes. They were patriots. I imagine that’s one of the reasons why six four-star generals and a whole lot of others have endorsed me who used to work for him because they know where his heart isn’t. That’s how he sees us. That’s the attitude he’s brought toward this whole crisis. This is the same man, you may remember, when he was told we were averaging 1000 lives lost per day, remember what he said? He said, “It is what it is.” Such concern and empathy. It is what it is. Well, it is what it is because he is who he is. That’s why it is what it is. This President, as Debbie referenced, back in January when he was being briefed by the intelligence community, he said, “I never read the briefing.” Didn’t know what was in. Didn’t have time. Well, [inaudible 00:24:15] ego moved him to try to convince a famous journalist to write something good about him. What happened? Bob Woodward interviewed him. He acknowledged that he knew it was a dangerous and highly communicable disease, but he did nothing. He didn’t do a thing. He didn’t tell you. He didn’t tell any American. Why? He told Woodward on tape, he told Bob he didn’t want to panic the American public. Americans don’t panic. Trump panics. His reckless personal conduct since his diagnosis is unconscionable. The longer Donald Trump is the President, the more reckless he seems to get. Thank God we only have three weeks left to go. Dr. Fauci, the most respected doc in the country on these issues, referred to the President’s announcement on the Supreme Court in the Rose Garden, using the White House as a backdrop for political events. He said it was a super spreader event. And how is Trump responding? He’s running a national ad quoting Dr. Fauci out of context. Fauci had said way back in March, referring to public health officials across the nation, he said, quote, “I can’t imagine anybody could be doing more,” end of quote, meaning public health officials. But the Trump campaign, which is not unusual because I’ve had a piece of it, the trump campaign has deliberately lied. They have put Dr. Fauci in their ad asserting that Fauci was talking about Trump when he said they couldn’t have done anymore. And Fauci’s a man of integrity. After that ad came out, he said, “I did not give permission to use that quote and I wasn’t referring to the President.” Even after Fauci said that he didn’t say that about the President, the Trump ad campaign said they were going to continue to use the ad knowing it was a lie. And as a consequence to months of lying and misleading and irresponsible action on the part of Donald Trump, how many empty chairs are around the dining room table tonight because of his negligence? How many people’s hearts are broken? How many people have trouble going to sleep at night because you can’t just reach over and touch? They can’t hear their son or daughter’s voice on the phone, while he throws super spreader parties at the White House where Republicans hug each other without concern to the consequences. How many of you have been unable to hug your grandkids in the last seven months? I got six of them. Two of them I just see [inaudible 00:27:53] children, a boy and a girl live not far from me and they can walk through the woods. The only way I can see them, I stand in the back porch and they stand down and I bribe them with Haagen-Dazs bars. But every single day I contact them. But I can’t hug them. I can’t embrace it. And I’m luckier than most because they’re nearby, those two of those six. My grandkids, your grandkids, we hope will grow up to treat one another with kindness, respect and empathy, qualities the President has never, ever shown. It’s become painfully clear as his careless arrogant, reckless COVID response has caused one of the worst tragedies in American history. The only senior that Donald Trump cares about, the only senior is the senior Donald Trump [inaudible 00:28:52] seem to do anything for. And by the way, minority communities are getting particularly hit by this. You realize as of about a month ago, on a percentage basis, 1 in 1000 African Americans in all of American have died. And the estimate is, by the end of this year, 1 in 500 African Americans in America will die. 1 in 500. If he doesn’t do something quickly and we hit 400,000, that is more people, the same number of people that died in the war you fought of all four years. 400,000 dead in War War II, in less than a year if he doesn’t move. The only one Donald Trump would do anything for is Donald Trump. Look, folks, you all know we’re so much better than this. We’re so much better than this. We can contain this virus. We can fully reopen our economy. We can bring Congress together to pass real relief, and then implement a comprehensive agenda to build back better. My economic proposal … And by the way, it’s not a liberal think tank or a Democratic think tank that says this. An independent analysis put out by Moody’s, a Wall Street firm, projects that my economic plan will create 18.6 million good paying jobs between now and the end of the first term. Seven million more jobs than the President’s plan. And create a trillion more dollars in economic growth than the President’s plan. It’s solid. It’s real. Here’s how my plan works. I’m not going to raise taxes on a single solitary American making less than $400,000 a year. You won’t pay a penny more. It’s a guarantee. But I’m going to ask big corporations and the wealthy to begin to pay their fair share to straighten out the tax structure. That money will allow us to invest in working people. I carry it with me … I don’t know if I have it with me now, I don’t … a card that lists all of what is in the tax code. We went ahead, the President’s tax plan, Barack and I were suggesting we reduce corporate tax from 35% to 28. That was the consensus. He reduced it to 21%. You know how much that costs? $1.3 trillion. We just take it back up to 28, and we’ll generate $1.3 trillion more. 91 of the Fortune 500 companies don’t pay a penny in tax. Not a single solitary cent. If we made sure there was a minimum tax at 15%, that would add another $400 billion. We’re going to take this money and we’re going to invest in a working people, in a growing middle class and make sure everyone is included in the deal. I want tax reform in the tax code because we’re spending your tax dollars on the wrong things. As I said, Donald Trump cut the tax from 35 to 21 costing the treasury a fortune. As I said, if we raised it back to 28%, $1.3 trillion would be coming to the treasury over the next decade, instead of giving big corporations hundreds of billions to pay for buying back their own stock, moving jobs overseas. We should invest it in cures for cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. That’s why I proposed giving the National Institute of Health $50 billion over the next four years to go after cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. If we do not, and no drug company has the capacity to do it, if we do not find an answer to Alzheimer’s, then the next 19 years, every single solitary bed that exists in the United States of America now will be occupied by an Alzheimer’s patient. Look, my dad used to have an expression. He said, “Joey, if everything’s equally important to you, nothing’s important to you. You have to have priorities.” What are our priorities? Our priorities is to make sure that everybody in America has an equal shot. This is about you. It’s about what’s fair. It’s about what our priorities should be, and we can deal with the scourge of cancer and these other diseases when Donald Trump has no interest. In fact, he wants to do the opposite. He proposes more tax cuts for the super wealthy. Like Donald Trump, we’re going to ease the burden on major costs in your life, unlike him. Including the financial burden of caregiving so many families are now carrying. Right now, as you probably know, and you have friends, 800,000 Americans are eligible for home community care through Medicaid, signed up for it, have been waiting an average of five years. They’re waiting for a phone call back. For some, five years. My plan makes a bold investment so the states can clear the waiting list and also take the pharmaceutical companies. Will allow Medicaid to, again, use its enormous bargaining power to negotiate prices and bring the costs down for everyone, not just seniors. Give all Americans access to those lower prices. And what he also hates my doing and so do the drug companies, we’re going to establish a board like it is in other countries of outside experts to set limits on the prices of new specialty drugs that are life-saving drugs that costs an arm and leg, figuratively and literally, that have no competition. This board is going to set up and say, “This is how much you can charge based on what you’ve invested. You make a healthy profit, but you will not be able to raise the price of the drug without proof that you’ve taken other action that you have required you to improve the drug.” So it can only be raised with the cost of medical inflation. Independent analysis found that my plan will slash the cost of prescription drugs by 60%. How many of you know somebody who’s had to sell things just to get the drugs that have gone up exponentially? We’re going to protect Social Security and increase benefits for millions of seniors. I’ll fight to protect your pensions, including fixing older employer pensions, so many Floridians earned and deserve. Folks, I guess we’ll see them with this. I’m confident. I know as bad as things are we say, “Oh my God, how can it get better?” I am absolutely confident we can do this and more. We just have to come together. I’m running as a proud Democrat. I’m going to govern as an American president. I’m going to work as hard for those who voted against me as those who voted for me. That’s the job of a president. A duty to care. To care for everyone. And after all we’ve been through, all America’s accomplished, all the years that we’ve stood as a beacon to the world, we cannot let ourselves remain divided, but we have to vote. Go to, Iwillvote.com/fl. You can still request your vote by mail ballot. The deadline’s October 24. Request your ballot. If you have it already mail it or drop it in one of the drop boxes today. Look, I’m tired of us all walking around with our heads down, as if there’s nothing we can do. This is the United States of America. There’s not a single thing beyond our capacity, nothing we’ve ever decided to do we’ve not accomplished, when we done it together. Remember when we were kids, you had to learn about famous speech John Kennedy made about going to the moon. Everybody remembers the different pieces of it. The part I remember, my college used to kid me in the Senate when I was there. When answering the unasked question, “Why was he doing it?” He said, “Because we refuse to postpone.” We refuse to postpone one more day, which is within our capacity as Americans to do. There’s nothing beyond our capacity. There’s no limit to our future. We’ve got to stand up, lift our heads up. The only thing that can tear America part is America itself. And he’s well on the way trying to do that. Everybody knows who Donald Trump is. That’s within who we are. Who we are. We choose hope over fear. Unity, over division. Science over fiction. And yes, truth over lies. We can do this folks. I promise you. But you got to vote. May god bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you for listening. You’re a very patient audience. Thank you, thank you. Appreciate it."
"126","10-15-20"," Hey, and welcome to our town hall with Joe Biden. Mr. Vice President, welcome to you. Good to be with you. We’re here with a group of Pennsylvania voters. You can see they’re all appropriately socially distanced tonight. And there are a group of, some are voting for you, some have said they’re voting for president Trump, some are still undecided, and we’re going to try to take questions from as many of them as we can tonight. Okay. And we’re going to start with Nicholas Fed, and he’s from Jenkintown, Pennsylvania. That’s close to here, in Philadelphia. I know it well. You’re a Democrat. I’m a Democrat. Thank you, George. Mr. Vice President, every day, my wife and I are in disbelief at the lack of coordinated federal action on COVID-19. We know that your administration would follow the science. My question for you, it’s two parts. Well, first of all, going back, the fact is that the president was informed how dangerous this virus was. And all the way back in the beginning of February, I argued that we should be keeping people in China. And we had set up, in our administration, a pandemic office within the White House. There were 44 people on the ground. I suggested that we should be seeking, and I didn’t hold public office, I was a former Vice President, we in fact asked to have access to the source of the problem. And the best of our knowledge, Trump never pushed that. All those 44 people came home, never got replaced. In addition to that, I pointed out that I thought in February, I did a piece for USA Today saying, “This is a serious problem. Trump denied it. He said it wasn’t. We later learned that he knew full well how serious it was when he did an interview with George Woodward. I mean, excuse me, Bob Woodward. And at the time, he said he didn’t tell anybody because he was afraid Americans would panic. Americans don’t panic, he panicked. He didn’t say a word to anybody. Then I wrote a piece in March about what I thought we should be doing to take hold of this, using the… There’s an act that passed a long time ago that allows the president to go into a business and say, “Stop making this, and start making that.” And it took a long time for him to even institute that, to get ventilators and so on. And so, the point was he missed enormous opportunities and kept saying things that weren’t true. It’s going to go away by Easter, don’t worry about it. When the summer comes, it’s all going to go away like a miracle. He’s still saying those things. Before you go to the future, can I follow up on the, “I’m looking backwards. Not back then. In January, February. Not in January, February. No, that’s correct, there wasn’t. That came at the end of March. And then I laid out a detailed plan relative to school openings in June and July. By that time, the science was becoming clearer and clearer of how this was spreading so rapidly. But the president kept denying that. If you notice, from March on, I stopped doing big meetings, I started wearing masks. So, it was at a time when the science was saying, and his key people, Dr. Fauci were saying, “You should be taking these precautions.” So, what we should be doing now, there should be a national standard. Instead of leaving this up to, remember what the president said to the governors, “Well, they’re on their own, it’s not my responsibility. The governors can do what they need to do, not my responsibility.” It is a presidential responsibility to lead, and he didn’t do that. He didn’t talk about what needed to be done because he kept worrying, in my view, about the stock market. He worried if he talked about how bad this could be, unless we took these precautionary actions, then in fact, the market would go down. And his barometer of success to the economy is the market. Thirdly, what we didn’t do is, the president had an opportunity to open and allow schools and businesses to stay open if they got the kind of help they needed. So, the Congress passed a couple of trillion dollars worth of help. And what happened was most of that money, a significant portion of that money went to the very wealthiest corporations in the country, didn’t get to the mom and pop stores. So, you had one in five, one in six minority businesses closing. Many of them permanently. People being laid off. And then what happened was, when the first round of money for unemployment, enhanced unemployment went by, he didn’t do anything. He didn’t do anything. And to the best of my knowledge, and I mean this sincerely, I can’t think of, I’ve been around for a lot of presidents, and you know a lot of presidents in a crisis, I don’t ever remember one never calling the House and Senate Republicans, Democrats together. Let’s look forward a little bit. You said that you would lock down the economy, only if the scientists said it was necessary. By the way, in the context, would I lock down the economy if science said so? I said I’d follow science. But I don’t think there’s a need to lock down. Yeah, but I want to press you on that point. [crosstalk 00:06:15] Get there. What is most likely to happen is, the scientists will disagree. The scientists will disagree with the economist. Well, you can contain the pandemic by being rational and not crush economy. For example, I laid out a plan, how you can open businesses. You can open businesses and schools, if in fact you provide them the guidance that they need, as well as the money to be able to do it. What’s happening now is, we know, for example, if you can open a business and you could have a sign on the door saying, “Safe to come in.” And that’s why people aren’t going anyway, when they’re open. And say, because you have social distancing, you have plastic barriers, when you go to the cashier, you have separators between the booths. You don’t have large crowds, you reduce the size, the number of people you can have in the restaurant. You make sure there’s testing, that’s a really critical piece that he didn’t do testing and tracing. And you make sure that people are equipped, going to schools. You know, we initially said, the government initially said, they’re going to provide masks for every student and every teacher. Then they said, “No, no, no, no.” FEMA said, the president or whomever said, ‘No, no, no. That’s not a national emergency, not a national emergency. We need more teachers in our schools to be able to open smaller pods. We need ventilation systems change. There’s a lot of things we know now, and I laid them out in some detail. Now again, when I say I laid them out, I’m not an office holder. I’m running for office. It’s not like I’m still Vice President, or I wasn’t a United States Senator pushing this. So, I don’t want to say, “I, I, I.” But we did lay out exactly what needed to be done. And take a look, we make up 4% of the world’s population. We have 20% of the world’s deaths. We’re in a situation where we have 210 plus thousand people dead. And what’s he doing? Nothing. He’s still not wearing masks, and so on. We’re getting some other questions on COVID. Sure. The next one comes from Kelly Lee. She’s from Philadelphia. Thank you. Republican. Voted for Donald Trump in 2016. I did. Undecided now. Hey, Kelly. Hi, Mr. Biden. My question is about the coronavirus vaccine, or potential. Yes. Senator Harris stated that she absolutely would not take a vaccine from President Trump. And of course, we all know it’s not President Trump that would create this vaccine. It would be doctors and scientists that presumably we all trust. Two things. Number one, President Trump talks about things that just aren’t accurate, about everything from vaccines, we’re going to have one right away, is it going to happen, and so on. The point is that, if the scientists, if the body of scientists say that this is what is ready to be done, and it’s been tested, they’ve gone through the three phases. Yes, I would take it. I’d encourage people to take it. But President Trump says things like, everything from this crazy stuff he’s walking away from now, inject bleach in your arm, and that’s going to work. I’m not being facetious, he’s actually said these things. And now, Regeneron is the answer. That’s going to cure everything. There’s 500,000 doses, we have more than a few million people, you know? And so, if you noticed, most of the companies who are developing these vaccines are working, they’re making real progress. I meet with four leading scientists, at least twice a week. In the beginning, four times a week, giving us the detail on what kind of progress is being made. And right now, they do the right thing. When they run into a serious problem, they halt the test. They don’t continue until they figure out what the problem was. They’re not there yet. And the most scientists say, that it’s not likely to have a vaccine that would be available until the beginning of next year, into the spring of next year. And in the meantime, what I worry about is the same thing with Regeneron, which is a useful antidote. Not antidote, a useful tool. But what’s happening is there was no plan to figure out how to distribute it. We have 500,000 vials of it. Well, we don’t have all the testing equipment. We don’t have all the ability to get it to the people who need it. And what we should be doing now, and allegedly it’s happening, but I’ve not seen it yet nor the docs that I’ve talked to seen it. The answer is, depending on how clear… Vaccines, they say, have a very positive impact and that you’re going to affect positively 85% of the American public. Or there’s others say, “This vaccine is really the key. This is the golden key.” It depends on the state of the nature of the vaccine when it comes out, and how it’s being distributed. But I would think that we should be talking about, depending on the continuation of the spread of the virus, we should be thinking about making it mandatory. Well, you couldn’t, that’s the problem. Just like you can’t enforce measles, you can’t come to school unless you have a measles shot. You know, you can’t. But you can’t say, everyone has to do this, just like you can’t mandate a mask. But you can say, you can go to every governor and get them all in a room, all 50 of them as president and say, ” Ask people to wear the mask. Everybody knows. And if they don’t, no. Not fine. Then I go to every governor, I go to every mayor, I go to every councilmen, and I go to every local official, say, “Mandate the mask.” Say, “This is what you have to do when you’re out. Make sure you encourage it being done.” Look, George, you and I know, and I think you do too as well, the words of a president matter. Absolutely. No matter whether they’re good, bad, or indifferent, they matter. And when a president doesn’t wear a mask or makes fun of folks like me, when I was wearing a mask for a long time, then people say, “Well, it mustn’t be that important.” But when a president says, “I think this is very important.” For example, I walked in here with this mask, but I have one of the N95 masks underneath it. I left it in my dressing room. Not the dresser, the room I was in before I got here. And so, I think it matters what we say. And we’re now learning that children are getting the virus, not with as serious consequences, but there’s been no studies done yet on vaccines for children. So, there’s a long way to go, but we can make progress in the meantime and save lives. And the last point I’ll make, if you listen to the head of the CDC, he stood up and he said, “You know, while we’re waiting for a vaccine.” He held up a mask. “You wear this mask, you’ll save more lives between now and the end of the year than if we had a vaccine.” It’s estimated by every major study done from the University of Washington to Columbia, that if in fact we wore masks, we could save, between now and the end of the year, a hundred thousand lives. And avoid lockdown, yes. You don’t have to lock down if you’re wearing the mask. Let’s get a question on the economy. Thank you, I hope I answered your question. … from Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, it’s a suburb of Pittsburgh. Republican. I know it. Voted for President Trump. Thank you, George. Thank you, Mr. Vice President. You stated that anyone making less than $400,000 will not see one single penny of their taxes raised. That’s right. But also, state that you are going to eliminate the Trump tax cuts. The Trump tax cuts reduces taxes for the majority of workers. I would argue, not enough. I carry this card with me. When I said the Trump tax cuts, about 1.3 trillion of the $2 trillion in his tax cuts went to the top one 10th of 1%. That’s what I’m talking about eliminating, not all the tax cuts that are out there. And by the way, if you take a look, we reduced the corporate tax rate from 35%. and Democrats, Republicans who were in office thought it should come down to 28%. He reduced it to 21%. You have 91 out of the Fortune 500 companies not paying a single solitary penny. If you raise the corporate tax back to 28%, which is a fair tax, you’d raise one trillion, three hundred billion dollars by that one act. If you made sure that people making over 400 grand paid what they did in the Bush administration, 39.6%, you would raise another, it goes up to let me get you the exact number here, about another 200, excuse me. $92 billion. So, you could raise a lot of money to be able to invest in things that can make your life easier. Make you change your standard of living by making sure you have affordable health care, by making sure you’re in a situation where you’re able to send your kid to school. If you have student debt, you can deal with it. Making sure that your home, you can pay your mortgage. You got 20 million people, right now. Mr. Vice President, let me press you on that though. Sure. You’re going to raise the corporate tax, you’re going to raise taxes on the wealthy. Absolutely. Another 900, 000 people have filed for unemployment. That’s a great question. Moody’s did analysis of my detailed analysis of my tax plan and my economic plan. They said, I will, in four years, Moody’s Wall Street, said I will create 18.6 million new jobs, good paying jobs, number one. Number two, the GDP will grow by a trillion dollars more than would under Trump, and 7 million more jobs than under Trump. And the reason is, when you allow people to get back in the game and have a job, everything moves. Everything moves. Right now, you got the opposite. You had, last year during this pandemic, you had the wealthiest billionaires in the world, in the nation, they made another $700 billion. $700 billion. He talks about a V-shape recovery. It’s a K shape recovery. If you’re on the top, you’re going to do very well. And if you’re in the bottom, or you’re in the middle or the bottom, your income is coming down. You’re not getting a raise. I shouldn’t, I don’t know what you do. You may get a raise. Hope you’re a billionaire. But all kidding aside, it’s about growing the economy. And George, the way out, the reason why I’m so optimistic about economic recovery, more than I’ve ever been, is we have these four crises happening all at once. And one helps the other. For example, we’re going to invest a great deal of that money into infrastructure, and to a green infrastructure. We’re going to put 500,000 charging stations on new highways we’re building, and all highways we’re building. We’re going to own the electric market. You know as well as I do from your days, you know, in the old days, where the president spends about $600 billion a year on government contracts. Everything from making sure they have aircraft carriers, to automobile fleets in the United States. If you make, and it’s not in violation of any international trade agreement, made in America. If you actually insist that whatever that product is, made in America, including the material that goes into the product. It is estimated we’re going to create somewhere between another four and six million jobs just by doing that. But what’s happening now under his trade policy, a lot of this is going overseas. You get a benefit from going overseas, if you have much of it being made overseas. So, if you send it overseas, you get a 10% tax increase on a product. If you make it in America and you bring it back, you get a 10% growth. If you bring back a company, and you’re going to open up an old facility, you get a 10% tax credit for all you invested. That actually works, George. No, well. I got to get the votes. I got to get the votes. That’s why, the one thing, I have this strange notion. We are a democracy. Some of my Republican friends and some of my Democratic friends, even occasionally say, “Well, if you can’t get the votes by executive order, you’re going to do something. Things you can’t do by executive order, unless you’re a dictator.” We’re democracy, we need consensus. Got to take a quick break. We’ll be right back. I hope I answered your question. We the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America. This special edition of 2020 will return in a moment. (silence) The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. From the Constitution Center in Philadelphia here again, George Stephanopoulos. And welcome back to our town hall with Joe Biden. We’re going to get a question now from Cedric Humphrey. He’s a student from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Progressive Democrat. Don’t jump, Cedric. You’re look like you’re way up there. I’ll be okay. Thank you, George. And good evening, former Vice President Biden. Good evening. Many people believe that the true swing demographic in this election will be Black voters under the age of 30, not because they’ll be voting for Trump, but because they won’t vote at all. I myself have had this exact same conflict. Well, I’d say first of all, as my buddy John Lewis said, “It’s a sacred opportunity, the right to vote. You can make a difference.” If young Black women and men vote, you can determine the outcome of this election. Not a joke. You can do that. Then the next question is, am I worthy of your vote? Can I earn your vote? And the answer is, there’s two things I think that I care and I’ve demonstrated I care about my whole career. One is, in addition to dealing with a criminal justice system to make it fairer and make it more decent, we have to be able to put Black Americans in a position to be able to gain wealth, generate wealth. And so you look at what that entails. It entails everything from early education, that’s why I’m supporting making sure that Title One schools, as you know, schools with the least tax base to be able to support their schools, I increased the funding from them from $15 to $45 billion. That allows every teacher in that school to make up to 60,000 bucks, and the problem now is they’re leaving the schools. They’re not there. We’re short about a million and a half teachers, a million and a quarter teachers. Number two, every three and four and five-year-old will go to school, school, not daycare, school, and with all the great universities, including the one you’ve gone to, go to, or went to, in fact, talks about in the last eight years, what’s happened. What happens when you let them go to school? They make up rapidly whatever shortcoming they had in terms of their education prior to that. They have not heard as many words spoken, et cetera, et cetera. What happens is that, the studies show, that 58% will increase by 58% their chance of going all through 12 years of school, and going through successfully. It will also provide for the ability to bring in social workers and school psychologists. We have one school psychologist in America now for every 1,507 kids. It should be one to 500, not just in schools that are poor, but in all schools, because we learned that, for example, drug abuse doesn’t cause mental illness, mental illness causes drug abuse, the failure to get hold of people and deal with their anxieties. In addition to that, I provide for a $70 billion for HBC use for them to be able to have the wherewithal to do what other universities can do, because they don’t have the kind of foundational support they need. And so that would allow them, for example, like we did in our administration, the President allowed me to go down and we awarded a cybersecurity laboratory, ability to compete for cybersecurity laboratory. The federal government spends billions of dollars a year on universities, because there are the best kept secret and where most of the major inventions come out of. And so that school now will be able to produce young Black women and men who are going to go into a field of the future that’s burgeoning, cybersecurity. And that’s what is going to help a great deal. In addition to that, if you’re a young man about to graduate and you graduated from school and you want to own your first home, well, it’s awful hard to get the money, depending on the background, where your economic background is, to get a down payments. So we’re going to guarantee first term home buyers a $15,000 down payment for first term home buyers. In addition to that, all the studies now show, and I’ve been arguing this for a long time, is young Black entrepreneurs are just as successful as White entrepreneurs or anyone else given a shot. But you can’t get the money. Where do you go to get the startup money? So what President Obama and I did, we had a program where we took $1.5 billion and we invested it in all the SBAs around the country, and the state SBAs, small business associations, and that generated $30 billion came off the sideline. Because if you have a guarantee of $200,000 for your new startup enterprise, a young entrepreneur, you’re going to be able to attract, if it’s government money and it’s a guarantee, you could be able to attract another $100,000. It generated $30 billion. Well, I’m changing that program and I’ll get this done without much trouble I believe in the Congress from $1.5 million to $30 billion. That’ll take $300 billion off the sideline and grow. And, for example, if you, in fact, and I were the same age and we split our differences, if we were the same age, and we went to the same builder to buy us each the same home, but my home was in a White neighborhood on one side of a highway, and yours is in a Black neighborhood, same exact home, your home will start off being valued 29% less than my home. Yet your insurance for that home will be higher. You’ll be taxed more for it. We’ve got to end this. That’s what got me involved in politics in the first place, a thing called red lining. We can change so much that we can do so much to change the circumstances to give people a real opportunity. Cedric. I think so. Well, there’s a lot more if you’re going to hang around afterwards. I’ll tell you more. Okay. No, but I really mean it. It’s the key. Look, this is the way every other … Like my dad, he lost his job up in Scranton and it took him three years to be able to move down to Delaware, to Claymont, Delaware, a little steel town, and send us home to our grandpop to live with him. We finally got back. We lived in an apartment, which became six and eight housing much later. It was just normal apartments. But it took him five years to be able to buy a home. Well, we bought a three bedroom home with four kids and a grandpop living with us, but it accumulated wealth. You built up wealth. That’s how middle-class folks make it. They build up wealth. Then he was able to borrow a little against that to be able to help us get the school, those kinds of things. It’s about accumulating wealth and you’re behind an eight ball. The vast majority of people of color are behind an eight ball. And it’s the same way what’s going on now with all this money that’s been voted. What’s happened? You go to the bank, if you’re a Black businessman, and the President fired the only Inspector General to see oversee all this help coming from the Congress. And what happens? You go in and they say, “Ah, do you have an account here?” “No.” “Do you have a credit card?” “No.” “Have you borrowed from us before ?” “No.” We bailed these suckers out. They’re not liable for any of the money, but they still won’t lend it to you. We’ve got to change that. It’s about accumulating wealth. I want to get another question in here from Angelica Politarhos. I’m sorry. No, not at all. Garnet Valley, Pennsylvania. Hi. Republican who voted for President Trump last time. Thank you. Thank you, George. Thank you, Vice President Biden. Nice to meet you. Well, first of all, things have changed drastically. That Crime Bill, when it voted, the Black Caucus voted for it. Every Black mayor supported it across the board and the Crime Bill itself did not have mandatory sentences except for two things. It had three strikes and you’re out, which I voted against, in the Crime Bill, but it had a lot of other things in it that turned out to be both bad and good. I wrote the Violence Against Women Act. That was part of the assault weapons ban and other things that were good. What I was against was giving states more money for prison systems that they could build, state prison systems. And you have 93 out of every 100 people in jail now is in a state prison, not in a federal prison, because they built more prisons. I also wrote into that bill a thing called drug courts. I don’t believe anybody should be going to jail for drug use. They should be going into mandatory rehabilitation. We should be building rehab centers to have these people housed. We should decriminalize marijuana, wipe out the record so you can actually say honesty, “You ever been arrested for murder for anything?” You can say no, because we’re going to pass a law saying there is no background that you have to reveal relative to the use of marijuana. And so there’s a lot of things. But in addition to that, we’ve got to change the system. I joined with a group of people in the House to provide for changing the system from punishment to rehabilitation. Along with a guy named Marlon Specter, who you may remember, I wrote the Second Chance Act. In the meantime, an awful lot of people were jailed for minor drug crimes after the Crime Bill. Right. Yes, it was. But here’s where the mistake. The mistake came in terms of what the states did locally. What we did federally, we said, you remember, George, it was all about the same time for the same crime. What I had done as the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I took the 10 Circuit Courts of Appeals, took some really brilliant lawyers working for me in Judiciary, we did a study and we determined what happens if, for the first, second, third offense for any crime in the criminal justice system at the federal level, if you’re a Black man and it’s the first time you’ve committed robbery, how long would you go to jail? On average? If you’re White man, how long? The Black man would go to jail on average 13 years. White man, two years. I’d go down the list of every single crime. So we set up a sentencing commission. We didn’t set the time. Every single solitary maximum was reduced in there. But what happened was it became the same time for the same crime. So it said, “You have to serve between one and three years.” And it ended up becoming much lower, Black folks went to jail a lot less than they would have before. But it was a mistake. Let me ask another follow-up on the Crime bill. It also funded 100,000 police back in 1994. You’ve often said that more cops clearly mean less crime. Yes, if in fact they’re involved in community policing, not jump squads. For example, when we had community policing, from the mid-’90s on until till Bush got elected, what happened? Violent crime actually went down precipitous. Remember the significant rise in violent crime that was occurring in the late ’80s into the ’90s. It went down and fewer African Americans were arrested because you had the requirement. The cops didn’t like it. They didn’t like the community policing, because you had to have two people in the vehicle, they had to get out of their cars, they had to introduce themselves to who own the local liquor store, who owned the local grocery store, who was the woman on the corner. And what they would do, George, they’d actually go and give people their phone numbers. A cop would give the phone number. So if Nelly Smith was on the second floor where drug deals took place and things happened below her apartment, she could call and say, “It’s Millie, and there’s something going on here.” And they’d never revealed it was her, because they’d know, if she knew that, in fact, they report, they’d never report the crime, she’d never report. So it actually started to come down. And what happened? They eliminated the funding for community policing. Community policing doesn’t mean more people coming in, in armored Humvees and swarming. It turned out that by the time we got to the late ’90s and crime had come down so much, the mayors and everybody asked the question, “Where do you want me to spend the money?” They say, “Well, only 1% thought violent crime was a problem.” It was as high as 22%. Right now we have a systemic problem. How do you get the kind of policing, prevent the kind of policing [crosstalk 00:35:55]. You have to change the way in which they [inaudible 00:35:55]. One of the things I’m going to do, George, is what is set up a national study group made up of cops, social workers, as well as made up of the Black community and the Brown community to sit down in the White House and over the next year come up with significant reforms that need to take place within communities. You have to bring them together. One of the things I’ve observed is, the neighborhood I grew up, I grew up in Claymont, you either became a cop, a firefighter, or a priest. I wasn’t qualified much to do any one of them, but here’s the deal, all kidding aside. Most cops don’t like bad cops. Correct. They don’t like it. That’s correct. And so what happens is they get intimidated into not reporting. So one of the things we do is there has to be transparency available. We have to be able to go in at the federal level, be able to go in and check out whether or not there’s systematic problems within police departments. If, in fact, a cop needs to be tried, it’s not the prosecutor in the community, in the district there. You’ve got to go outside the community to get another prosecutor to come in to handle the crime. There’s a lot of things we’ve learned, and it takes time but we can do this. You can ban choke holds, but beyond that, you have to teach people how to de-escalate circumstances. De-escalate. So instead of anybody coming at you and the first thing you do is shoot to kill, you shoot them in the leg. There’s ways you have to do more background checks in terms of whether or not the person coming in, passes a certain psychological test. And the last thing I’ll say, and I’m sorry, but it’s really, I think, really, really important, is you have to be in a position where you are able to identify, identify the things that have to change. And one of the things that has to change is so many cops get called into circumstances where somebody is mentally off. Like what happened not long ago, that guy with the knife. That’s why we have to provide within police departments psychologists and social workers to go out with the cops on those calls, some of those 911 calls to de-escalate the circumstance, to deal with talking them down. But cops are kind of like school teachers now. A school teacher has to know everything from how to handle hunger in a household as well as how to teach how to read. Well, cops or don’t have that breadth, and there’s a lot of things we can do. We shouldn’t be defunding cops. We should be mandating the things that we should be doing within police departments and make sure there’s total transparency. Got to take another quick break. We’ll be right back. I don’t know the answer to your question. He shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Judges of the Supreme Court, and all other officers of the United States. From the Constitution Center in Philadelphia, here again, George Stephanopoulos. And the Supreme Court is our next topic. The questioner, Nathan Osburn of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Democrat. Hi, I’m George and Mr. Vice President. Hey, Nathan. Our country’s first Supreme Court gave its first ruling is just two blocks from here from 1791 to 1800, and it’s become more polarized since then. Merrick Garland didn’t get a hearing for all of 2016 and Amy Coney Barrett is being pushed through at the last minute, even though millions have already voted. Well, let me start at the last point and work my way back. I think there’s great reason to be concerned. I was on the road most of the time during these hearings so I didn’t hear many of them. I just got the recaps when I’d get in late at night. I’m been going around the country, Florida, anyway, but my reading online what the judge said was she didn’t answer very many questions at all. And I don’t even think she is laid out much of a judicial philosophy in terms of the basis upon which she thinks [inaudible 00:44:48] in the Constitution, nonetheless. So, number one. So I think there’s great reason to be concerned for the LGBT community, something I fought very hard for, for a long time to make sure there’s equality across the board. Number two, I think that also healthcare overall is very much in jeopardy as a consequence of the President’s going to go directly after this election directly to the Supreme Court within a month to try to get Obamacare wiped out after 10 million people have already lost her insurance from their employer and wants to take 20 million people out of the system as well, plus 100 million people with pre-existing conditions. So there’s a lot at stake. I don’t think it’s appropriate. I think the Constitution implies, there’s no provision in the Constitution, my problem is I made a mistake of teaching constitutional law for 21 years, and the separation of powers, the Constitution implies that their way the people have a right to determine who’s going to be on the court is how they vote for their Senators and their President. We seek the advice and consent of the Senate. He is. But once an election begins, by implication, it is inconsistent with the constitutional principles, in my view. You get disagreement among scholars on this, but I believe it’s inconsistent when millions of people have already voted to put someone on the Court. I think it should have been held until this election is over, see what the makeup of the Senate is going to be. If the President wins this election, he should be able to go for it. But how about that question of expanding the court? Here’s what you said exactly one year ago tonight at a Democratic debate. You said, “I would not get into court packing. I would not pack the court.” That’s not what you’re saying now. What I wanted to do, George, you know if I had answered the question directly then all the focus would be on, what’s Biden going to do if he wins? Instead of on, is it appropriate what is going on now? And it should stay. This is the thing that the President loves to do, always take our eye off the ball what’s at stake. One of the things Pete has suggested is, and there’s a number of constitutional scholars have suggested as well, that there are at least four or five options that are available to determine whether or not you can change the way in which the court lifetime appointment takes place consistent arguably with the Constitution. I have not been a fan of court packing because then it just generates what will happen. Whoever wins, it just keeps moving in a way that is inconsistent with what is going to be manageable. Well, I’m not a fan. It depends on how this turns out. Not how he wins, but how it’s handled, how it’s handled. But there’s a number of things that are going to be coming up and there’s going to be a lot of discussion about other alternative as well. What does that mean, how it’s handled? How will that determine [crosstalk 00:23:42]. For example, there’s actually real live debate on the floor, if people are really going to be able to have a time to go through this. I don’t know anybody who’s gone on the floor that’s been a controversial justice in terms of making fundamentally or altering the makeup of the court that’s gone through in a day kind of thing. … and the makeup of the court has gone through in a day kind of thing. I mean, it depends on how much they rushed this. And you think about it, George, here you got a lot of people not to be able to pay their mortgage, not being able to put food on the table, not being able to keep their business open, not being able to do anything to deal with what’s going on in terms of the economy as a consequence of COVID and they have no time to deal with that, but they have time to rush this through. Well, right now it looks like they’re going to have a vote around Halloween. So if they vote on it, [crosstalk 00:48:26] for the election. I’m open to considering what happens from that point on. It is. Good choice. No matter what answer I gave you, if I say it, that’s the headline tomorrow. It won’t be about what’s going on now, the improper way they’re proceeding. They do have a right to know what I stand and they’ll have a right to know where I stand before they vote. Yes. Depending on how they handle this. But look, what you should do is you got to make sure you vote and vote for a senator who in fact reflects your general view on constitutional interpretation, and vote for a president who thinks is more in line with you. And if you oppose the position that I would not have appointed her, but if you oppose my position, vote for Trump, vote for Republican who shares that view, but that’s your opportunity to get involved in lifetime appointments that have presidents come and go, justices stay and stay and stay. You have a question from a Republican, Andrew Lewis. I would guess a disaffected Republican. You cast a write-in vote for John Kasich in 2016. You’re going to vote against President Trump this year. John’s writing in for me, by the way. I know that. I’m sorry. Mr. Vice President, my father Drew Lewis served as secretary of transportation under President Ronald Reagan in his first time. Oh yeah, I’ll be darned. And some of his closest allies and friends were Democrats, including House Speaker Tip O’Neill and Senator Ted Kennedy. Sadly, today we have highly partisan and dysfunctional governance. And I believe President Trump is primarily responsible for creating this toxic environment. It was written by a fellow who won the Pulitzer prize for a book he wrote about the presidency. He said I doubt whether Biden is really Irish. He doesn’t hold a grudge. In politics, grudges don’t work. They make no sense. I really mean it. I have never, and the second point I’d make is everybody talks about, “Yeah, Joe, when you were a senator and a chairman of foreign relations or chairman of judiciary, you got a lot of things done. You’re able to cross the aisle but the days are changed. When you’re vice president, you got a lot done, but it can’t happen anymore.” It can. We got to change the nature of the way we deal with one another. And it starts off by the way your father was and Tip was and others. You don’t question another man or woman’s motive. You can question their judgment, but not their motive. We badly needed an infrastructure bill. Well, what happens? I stand up and I say, “We need an infrastructure bill, Senator, but I tell you what, you’re in the pocket of the cement industry, but let’s see what we can do.” He can’t get anywhere. Nothing happens. Nothing happens. I learned that lesson a long time ago. I’ve never, even when it’s obvious on its face what the motive is, stick to the subject and listen to the other guy. Listen, what I will be doing as, if I’m elected president and the first thing and not a joke. And you can ask if they’d tell you, your dad’s old friends in the Republican side, I’m going to pick up the phone and call them and say, “Let’s get together. We’ve got to figure out how we’re going to move forward here. Because there’s so many things we really do agree on. And with Trump out of the way, the vindictiveness of a president going after Republicans who don’t do exactly what he says gets taken away. There’s going to be, I promise you, between four and eight Republican senators who are going to be willing to move on things where there’s bipartisan consensus. Last example I’ll give you. After Trump had been elected, named the next president, wasn’t sworn in yet, I’ve been working on a thing called a bill relating to cancer cures. Okay? And it was called the Cancer Moonshot. And I work with a number of Democrats and Republicans. And we had a bill that was about $9 billion that made significant increases in research and development on cancer alternatives, NIH and particularly specific cancer initiatives. And we only had at the time I think it was 111 or 114, whatever it was, votes in the house. I don’t hold any exact number. And we had fewer than 40 in the Senate, but after he was elected, I got those people together as vice president and we sat down and we worked it out and we ended up getting a pass 396 votes in the house and 94 votes in the Senate. And at the end of the day, because it had to do with the Biden Cancer Moonshot I’ve been working on, Mitch McConnell. Mitch McConnell stood up and I was presiding officer and moved to name the bill after my deceased son, Beau, who had just died. So, there are ways to bring this together. But how about the question of political accountability? Is there some tension between that and bringing people together? Robert Mueller laid out a lot of evidence of possible obstruction of justice by President Trump. What the Biden Justice Department will do is let the Department of Justice be the Department of Justice. Let them make the judgments of who should be prosecuted. They’re not my lawyers. They’re not my personal lawyer. I’m not going to rule in or out. Well, I’m going to hire really first rate prosecutors and people who understand the law like Democrat and Republican administrations have had, and let them make the judgements, but turning this into a vehicle for your, as if it’s your own law firm, you don’t own that justice department. You pick the best people you can and you hope that what they’re going to do is they’re going to enforce the law as they see it. But can you remember any Republican president going out there or former Democratic president go find that guy and prosecute him? Remember, where you hear that? Or by the way, I’m being sued because a woman has accused me of rape. Represent me. Represent me. Personally represent me in the state of New York on my not allowing my tax returns. Got to take another break. We’ll be right back. The executive power shall be vested in a president of the United States of America. He shall hold his office during the term of four years and together with the vice president chosen for the- From the constitution center in Philadelphia, here again, George Stephanopoulos. And welcome back to our town hall with Former Vice President Joe Biden. We’re going to look at the environment right now. We’re going to get a question from Michele Ellison and from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, businesswoman, a social worker. You’re a Republican who’s voted for Democrats, but you’re not sure what you’re going to do this time around. Correct. Greetings Former Vice President Biden. Hello. Thank you, Mr. Stephanopoulos. In a 2012 report of the University of Pittsburgh’s Institute of Politics fracking was discussed and it is possible implications for the waterways from the Commonwealth to the gulf. Fracking has made the population sick and killed wildlife in Southwest Pennsylvania. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and small business development centers have already begun to transition people away from fossil fuels. Well, first of all, I make it clear. I do not propose banning fracking. I think you have to make sure that fracking is in fact not emitting methane or polluting the well or dealing with what can be small earthquakes in how they’re drilling. So, it has to be managed very, very well, number one. Number two, what we have to do is the future rests in renewable energy. The single fastest growing energy source in the world right now, because I’m going to say something that’s going to sound self-serving, but I manage the RecoveryAact and I was able to invest billions of dollars into bringing down the cost per BTU of wind and solar. So now it’s cheaper than coal, is cheaper than oil right now, and it has great, great promise. And it’s also the fastest growing employer in the energy industry. And so there are a number of things that I would do immediately. Number one, there are well over 100,000 wells that are left uncapped in the region. We could hire 128,000 of these people who are working in the industry to cap these wells and get a good salary doing it now, number one. Number two, we should be moving toward finding the new technologies that are going to be able to deal with carbon capture. So, ultimately, it’s a transition we moved from, to a net zero emission of carbon that we’re still going to be able to use if we find the right technology, some gases, some gas to be able to, if we can carbon capture. And I think we’re going to be able to move in a direction where by the year 2035, we’ll be able to have net zero emissions of carbon from the creation of energy, energy creation so we can move it by dealing with those. And every time we talk about global warming or the environment, the president thinks it’s a joke and I think as jobs, because what we’re going to have happened is you’ll be able to see now, as I started to say before. I as president is going to invest that $600 billion that we spend in government contracts, only on those things that in fact also are not only made in America, but building an infrastructure that’s clean and new. And what we have to do is focus on the transmission of energy across the country from areas relating to solar and wind. The reason is that they have not, that has not been mastered yet. I met a lot of people in Silicon Valley. The battery technology is increasing significantly so you’re going to be able to have, for example, solar on your home and a battery the, this by this by this, as I’m showing you here in your basement. So when the sun doesn’t shine for five days, you still have enough energy. So, we’re making significant progress. The other thing we’re going to do is provide an awful lot of work. It’s estimated to put close to a million people to work by weatherizing four million buildings and two million homes, because we’ll save tons and tons of energy or billions of barrels of energy over time. And at the same time provide significant employment and a good union wages, prevailing wages. Let me stick on fracking for a second day. You said you don’t want to ban fracking. As you know, it’s an important issue here in Pennsylvania. Not everyone buys your denial. A member of the Boilermakers Local 154 Shawn Steffee was quoted in the New York Times today saying “You can’t have it both ways.” It says, “You can’t meet your goal to end fossil fuels without ending fracking. [crosstalk 01:04:34] Boilermaker’s overwhelming endorsement. Okay? So, the Boilermakers Union has endorsed me because I sat down with them and went in a great detail with leadership exactly what I would do, number one. Number two, what I would do is I would giving tax breaks and subsidizing oil. We don’t need to subsidize oil any longer, number one. We should stop that and save billions of dollars over time. What I would also do with regard to there’s no, the difference between me and the new green deal, they say automatically by 2030 we’re going to be carbon free. Not possible. So, are you for or against it? You say you’re not for it, but in your website, it says you call it a crucial framework, the green deal. My deal is a crucial framework, but not the new green deal. The new green deal calls for elimination of all non renewable energy by 2030. You can’t get there. You’re going to need to be able to transition, George, to be able to transition to get to the place where we invest in new technologies that allow us to do things that get us to a place where we get to net zero emission, including in agriculture. I’ve laid out a detailed plan. We should be taking the plan where we allow significant more land to be put in conservation, plant deep rooted plants which absorb carbon from the air and in fact, pay farmers to do it. We can do things like pelletize all the chicken manure and all the horse manure and cow manure, and take out the methane and use it as fertilizer and make a lot of money doing it. For example, right now, down in … And people when I say that, they wonder what I’m talking about. The biggest carbon sink in the world is the Amazon. More carbon absorbed from the air diminishing global warming in the Amazon than all the carbon emitted on a yearly basis from the United States of America from all vehicles on all means. So we have to use our imaginations. We have to move in the direction as well providing for electric vehicles. Electric vehicles will save billions of gallons of oil, [inaudible 01:06:38] estimated, not me, Wall street, one million automobile jobs, but we’re lagging me. I mean, we’re not investing. We’re not doing any of the research. Got to take another quick break. We’ll be right back. Welcome back to our town hall with Former Vice President Joe Biden. The next question comes from Mark Hoffman, Center Valley, Pennsylvania, conservative, who voted for Trump in 2016. Welcome to Pennsylvania, Mr. Vice President. Good to be back home. I’m from Pennsylvania. Yes, I know. Yep. So, pieces breaking out all over the world. Our troops are coming home. Serbia is talking to Kosovo and the Arabs and Israelis are talking peace which I believe is a modern day miracle what’s going on. A little more, but not a whole lot. We find ourselves in a position where we’re more isolated in the world than we’ve ever been. Were more isolated in the world than we ever have been. Our allies… Our go it alone, our America first has made America alone. You have Iran closer to having enough nuclear material to build a bomb. North Korea has more bombs and missiles available to it. We find ourselves where our NATO allies are publicly saying they can’t count on us. We’re in a situation as well, where in the far East, we find ourselves, in the Western Pacific, where we’re isolated as well. You have Japan and South Korea at odds with one another. China is making moves. So I would say, we’re find ourselves less secure than we’ve been. I do compliment the president on the deal with Israel recently. But if you take a look, we’re not very well trusted around the world. When 17 major nations in the world were asked who they trust more, who’s a better leader, and the president came in behind both, the international survey, both behind Putin, as well as Xi. And look what Putin is doing. You have bounties on American militaries heads in Afghanistan. They have more people there now, by the way, than when we left in Afghanistan. And we find ourselves in a situation where he’s talked to Putin six times, hadn’t said a word to him. And NATO is on the risk of beginning crack because they doubt whether we’re there. You see what’s happened in everything from Belarus to Poland, to Hungary, and the rise of totalitarian regimes in the world. And as well as, this president embraces all the thugs in the world. He’s best friends with the leader of North Korea, sending love letters. He doesn’t take on Putin in any way. He’s learned the art of the steal from the art of the deal by Xi and China. So I would respectfully suggest, no, there is no plan, no coherent plan for foreign policy. We’ve been most effective as a world leader, in my humble opinion, not just by the exercise of our power. We’re the most powerful nation in the world, but the power of our example. That’s what’s led the rest of the world to follow us on almost everything. He’s pulled out of almost every international organization. He gets laughed at, literally, not figuratively, when he goes to the United Nations. It’s not about the president, per se. It’s about the nation and the lack of respect that’s shown to us. Want to get one more question in this segment, and it comes from Mieke Haeck. She’s from State College, Pennsylvania. This is your first presidential election that you’re vote in. It is. Hi, Mieke. I’m good. Thank you. I’m the proud mom of two girls, 8 and 10. My youngest daughter is transgender. The Trump administration has attacked the rights of transgender people, banning them from military service, weakening non-discrimination protections, and even removing the word transgender from some government websites. I will flat out just change the law. Eliminate those executive orders, number one. You may recall, I’m the guy who said… I was raised by a man who, I remember, I was being dropped off. My dad was a high school educated, well-read man who was a really decent guy. And I was being dropped off to get an application in the center of our city, Wilmington, Delaware, the corporate capital of the world at the time. I’m getting out to get an application to be a lifeguard in the African-American community, because there was a big swimming pool complex. And these two men, well-dressed, leaned up and hugged one another and kissed one another. I’m getting out of the car at the light, and I turned to my dad. My dad looked me. He said, “Joey, it’s simple. They love each other.” The idea that an 8 year old child or a 10 year old child decides, “I decided I want to be transgender. That’s what I think I’d like to be. It’d make my life a lot easier.” There should be zero discrimination. And what’s happening is too many transgender women of color are being murdered. They’re being murdered. I think it’s up to, now, 17. Yeah. And that’s just this year. And so I promise you, there is no reason to suggest that there should be any right denied your daughter, or daughters, whichever, one or two. One. One. Your daughter, that your other daughter has a right to be and do. None. Zero. And by the way, my son Beau, who passed away, was the attorney general of the state of Delaware. He was the guy who got the first transgender law passed in the state of Delaware. And because of a young man who became a woman, who worked for him in the attorney general’s office. We’ve got one more segment coming up. Thank you. And I’m proud of her. We’ll be right back. The vice president and the people, a special edition of 2020. Here again, George Stephanopoulos. And welcome back to our town hall with former Vice President Joe Biden. The next question comes from Keenan Wilson, Narberth, Pennsylvania, Democrat. Good evening. You say that you committed to entering this race after the events of Charlottesville in 2017. I assume that that feeling that prompted you to run will not go away once the results are determined. Well, to be very honest with you, I think that’s very hard. Things have not let themselves to him learning from what’s happened, what’s gone before. Instead of being chastened by being one of the few presidents, the only president to be impeached and then have a member of his own party vote to expel him, it emboldened him. But what I will do… Hopefully, I’ll go back to being a professor at the University of Pennsylvania. And making the case that I’ve been made, and at the Biden Institute at the University of Delaware, focusing on these same issues, relating to what constitutes decency and honor in this country. It’s the thing that got me involved in public life to begin with. As a kid, I’d moved from Scranton, where there were no African-Americans and moved down to Claymont, Delaware. And in Delaware we have the eight largest Black population, as a percent of population. It was an epiphany for me seeing what was going on, and I got deeply involved. I’m no great shakes. I wasn’t John Lewis. I don’t mean to imply that. But it’s the thing that’s motivated… My dad used to have an expression for real. He said, “Everyone’s entitled to be treated with dignity. Everybody.” And it was real. Everybody is. And so whether I’m a defeated candidate for president back teaching or I’m elected president, it is a major element of everything that I’m about, because it reflects who we are as a nation. Every single solitary generation, the dial has moved closer and closer and more and more to inclusion. And we are a country that is a country of slaves who came here 400 years ago, Indigenous people, and everyone else is an immigrant. And we’re a diverse country. And unless we are able to treat people equally, we’re just never going to meet our potential. But I think the American people want to see that happen. I think they’re ready to see it happen. And I’d tell you one thing, if I’m elected president, you will not hear me race baiting. You’ll not hear me dividing. You’ll hear me trying to unify, and bring people together. When I said I was running because I wanted to unify the country, people said, “Well, there are the old days.” We better be able to do it again. Agreed. We’d better be able to do it again. Mr. Well, it could say I’m a lousy candidate, and I didn’t do a good job. But I hope that it doesn’t say that we are as racially, ethnically, and religiously at odds with one another as it appears the president wants us to be. Usually, the president’s in my view, with all due respect, has been divide and conquer. The way he does better if he splits us. There’s division. And I think people need hope. Look, George, I’ve never been more optimistic about the prospect for this country than I am today. And I really mean that. I think the people are ready. They understand what’s at stake, and it’s not about Democrat or Republican. If I get elected, I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I’m going to be an American president. I’m going to take care of those who voted against me, as well as those who voted for me, for real. That’s a presence too. We got to heal this nation, because we have the greatest opportunity to any country in the world to own the 21st century. And we can’t do it divided. One more break. We’ll be right back. And we are wrapping up our town hall with former Vice President Joe Biden. Mr. Vice President, as you know, President Trump had a town hall meeting tonight, as well. During that town hall meeting, he was asked several times whether he took a COVID test the day of your last debate. You’re supposed to have another debate a week from tonight. Just two quick questions. Yeah. And by the way, before I came up here, I took another test. I’ve been taking them every day, the deep test, the ones that go in most. Because if I had not passed that test, I didn’t want to come here and expose anybody. And I just think it’s just decency, to be able to determine whether or not you’re clear. I’m less concerned about me, but then the guys with the cameras, the people working in the Secret Service guys you drive up with, all those people. And so, yes, I believe he will do that. Look, I’m going to abide by what the commission rules call for. I was prepared to debate him remotely, which was supposed to happen. And he said he wouldn’t do that, a virtual debate, or a town hall. He didn’t want to do that. I didn’t set those rules. The commission set the rules. So whatever rules they set, I’m confident that the Cleveland Clinic is the one overseeing it. I think they’re going to not let happen what happened last time. They’re going to demand that it’s safe. I expect to be there. Mr. Vice President, thank you for your time tonight. Thanks to all the questioners here. It was really terrific questions. I think you did a service to our democracy tonight. Thank you very much. I want to go back to my colleague, David Muir, in New York."
"127","10-16-20"," Hello, Michigan. Hi, how are you? What’s your name? Sam, good to see you, man. Thanks for being here. I appreciate it. Alexia, thank you for taking the time telling your story, it’s important. Unfortunately, there are an awful lot of stories like yours all over America as I travel the country, too many, it don’t have to be. And, folks, it’s great to be back, it’s great to be here. There’s not a better governor in the United States of America than Gretchen Whitmer, that’s a fact. I’ve met virtually all of them. And Gary, we badly need you back in the United States Senate, pal, we badly need you back in the United States Senate. And then my sister, Debbie Stabenow. God love you, Debbie. We worked so closely together for so long and as vice-president as well. Folks, look, we need to send Gary back to another term. Standing up for Michigan, Michigan families, small businesses. He was our main congressional partner back in 2010 when we passed the critical legislation supporting small businesses. I remember the president gave me the responsibility to go out and round up support. My go-to guy to get it done, I mean it sincerely was Gary. He was the go-to guy and he always shows up and he always shows up for Michigan. And like all of you, Jill and I are so grateful that the governor and her family are safe. It’s an unusual year. Governor you’ve been through a lot but my Lord, you are a leader. You stand up straight and tall and you don’t bend. Governor, it’s not easy to lead in moments of crisis but that’s a determination of whether you are a real leader when you stepped up to the crisis and you’ve stepped up, you’ve done it and you keep doing it. And as I said a moment ago you’re pretty much doing it better than anybody else in the whole United States of America. You’ve shown this whole nation just how tough and thoughtful you are, tough just like Michigan. I’ve got to believe this state has to be so proud of you. I know personally I am as I’ve gotten to know you and proud to call your friend, gov. We’re grateful to the FBI and law enforcement to discover these domestic terrorists and stop them. And make no mistake, that’s who they are, domestic terrorists, flat terrorists. Planning to blow up a bridge on American soil, to threaten the lives of police officers, to kidnap an elected later and now we’re finding out the same thing was happening in Virginia. It’s the sort of behavior you might expect from ISIS and it should shock the conscious of every American, every American. And the failure to condemn these folks is stunning from the outset. I remember it matters. You’ve heard me say it before, “Words matter.” And the words of a president particularly matter. When the president tweeted, “Liberate Michigan, liberate Michigan,” that’s the call that was heard, that was the dog whistle. Just like when he said, “Very fine people on both sides in Charlottesville.” Fathers, they came out of the fields carrying torches, their veins bulging, shouting antisemitic bile, carrying Nazi flags accompanied by the Klu Klux Klan. But when a young woman was killed protesting the president was asked what he think and he said something no president has ever, ever, ever, ever heard, “There were very fine people on both sides.” Those words were heard just like when he stood on the debate stage with me and refused to denounce white supremacists but told that white ring extremist group to “stand back and stand by.” Stand back and stand by, an American president? Not only shocked us but it stunned the world. Those words we heard. You know the reason I decided to run for president and I know that Debbie knows this. I hadn’t planned on running ever again after my son died. But when I saw those folks coming out of those woods I thought, “How in God’s name, how in God’s name can I remain silent?” And I said at the time it was somewhat not criticized but people didn’t think it was… Well, I don’t know what it was. When I said, “I think we’re in a battle for the soul of America,” I think we are. What I saw at Charlottesville and the president’s response to it is why I went to Gettysburg Battlefield of Pennsylvania last week. Because I thought there was need to stand up to hate in America and urge as Lincoln did to come together as a nation. Well, I’ve learned hate never goes away, it only hides. It never goes away, and if you’re given oxygen it comes out from one of the rocks, it grows. We need to be clear from the president going down in this country, there is no place for hate in America, period, none, it will not be tolerated. But President Trump revels in division and chaos to do anything to distract us from focusing on his failures to deal with this virus and to protect the nation. He’s still living in a dream world. He keeps telling us that this virus is going to disappear like America. He said, I think last night in his town hall, I didn’t have the pleasure of hearing it, I was doing one myself. He said, “We have turned the corner.” And my grandfather was sitting in my chair where he said, “He’s gone around the bunny. Turned the corner? My Lord. It’s not disappearing, in fact it’s on the rise again. It’s getting worse as predicted. And we all know the terrible price this nation has paid. Lives lost, unemployment way up, across Michigan and the country folks are worried about making their next rent payment and mortgage payment. Or their healthcare will be ripped away in the middle of a pandemic that you worked so damn hard, Gary, to keep. And we talked about this, Alexia. Kids in school, are they able to get back to school? More than 215,000 Americans, I think it’s 217 as of this morning, Americans have died from COVID-19. And experts have said, and I’ve been saying for the last month and a half that nearly another 200,000 lives are likely to be lost in the coming months between now and the first of the year if we continue to refuse to follow science. Because he refused to embracing wearing a mask, how many times on television have you seen him make fun of Biden wearing a mask? Because he refuses to practice social distancing he puts his supporters in such jeopardy. It’s estimated by his own folks, if we just wore masks nationally, almost 100,000 lives would be saved in the next few months. His own director of CDC said while we’re waiting for a vaccine, even if we had a vaccine, this will prevent more deaths between now and the end of January than a vaccine would. Know what’s really sad about all this? And I’ve been talking about this, but every time I repeat it, I get more… Well, I’m not very happy. The president knew and lied about knowing. He knew in January. The intelligence community and what they call the PDB, the Presidential Daily Briefings, which I’ve sat in on hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of them as vice-president. It got out that they laid out in detail to him how devastating this could be, how much life could be lost, and so on. He said he was unaware of it. Didn’t read those reports. Well, that surprised no one, he didn’t read the reports, but he didn’t read the reports. And everybody said, “Well, maybe he didn’t. But then as was acknowledged because of his ego, he wanted to impress a famous journalist, he thought he could change his mind about his view of him, he did a long interview with Bob Woodward. Bob Woodward, a renowned journalist, taped the interview with him, extensive interviews, hours. And he taped an interview where Trump said he knew this disease was deadly, significantly worse than the flu. But that’s not what he told you. That’s not what he told the public. And the reason he lied again to the American people? Well, he said he didn’t want to panic the American people. Americans don’t panic. Donald Trump panicked. That’s who panicked. As a consequence of his overwhelming lying, negligence, and irresponsible action, how many empty chairs were around the kitchen table this morning or the dining room table last night? How many? How many women or men leaned over when they got in bed last night and reached over to touch their husband and wife, and they weren’t there? You all know what loss is. It’s profound, especially when it was avoidable, much of it. But mishandling the pandemic isn’t enough for Trump. On top of that, he’s still trying to take away your healthcare. Trump’s still determined in the midst of this pandemic. And by the way, if projections… Pray, God, they’re not right, Father. But if they’re right, though, in the next several months, there’ll be over 200,000 additional deaths. That would be in one year 400,000 Americans would have died. That’s more than lost in all of World War II, hear me? World War II was four years. More American souls would have been lost than in World War II. What’s he doing? He’s still determined to destroy the Affordable Care Act. This isn’t hyperbole. Just like your opponent calls it a disaster. Talk about a disaster, there’s a disaster. The guy is 2000% or 200%, whatever it is with Trump. Hope everybody remembers. Look, as I said, this isn’t hyperbole. It’s real, as real as it gets. On November 10th the United States Supreme Court will hear the Trump administration make the case that the Affordable Care Act should be struck down in its entirety. I know everybody thinks they know, but I just want to remind you 10 million of you have already lost your health insurance because your employer’s health insurance, they’ve gone out of business. 10 million Americans already without health insurance. If Trump gets his way, 20 million more Americans will lose their health care. That’s God awful. In the midst of this God awful economic crisis, 100 million Americans will lose their protections for pre-existing conditions, including more than 4 million people right here in Michigan. Lifetime limits on benefits will be back. And by the way, a lot of you’ve been through what I’ve been through and worse. I can distinctly remember sitting on a bed with my Beau, my son, who came back from a year serving in Iraq, which this president talks about losers who serve, losers. With the same significant disease that your mom had, stage four glioblastoma. When it was diagnosed, when he got home, we asked the docs. It was only a matter of months, not if, just months. We never gave up hope. I remember watching him on that bed. He made it almost 16 months. Toward the end, and this is not about me, it’s about all of you, I consciously thought to myself, what would it feel like if they were able to walk in and say, “Mr Biden, you’ve outrun your insurance coverage. Suffer the last two or three months in pain on your own. Lots of luck.” Because that’s what was happening before. Insurers, if they win, and that’s what this court packing going on now is about, insurers will no longer allow you to keep your kids on your policy till age 26 in the middle of this economic crisis. Women, once again, will be charged more for their healthcare just because they’re a woman. Older folks will be able to be charged more. And as the governor said, long-term complications from COVID will become pre-existing conditions, joining asthma, diabetes, even pregnancy is a preexisting condition before. It could allow insurers to jack up your premiums or deny coverage altogether. Getting rid of Obamacare is why they’re racing to get this nominee through the Supreme Court. Make no mistake about it. Trump’s made it clear from the beginning, as your opponent has. He wants to get rid of Obamacare in its entirety. And with this nominee, he’s made that incredibly clear, as well. Michigan deserves so much better. Michigan deserves so much better, deserves leaders like Gary and Debbie Stabenow, public servants who lead with decency and honor, always look out for your needs, will think about how to ease the burden on your family. That’s the sort of leader you’ve got in Gretchen, in Governor Whitmer, as well. When she was in the state senate, she led the charge to secure Obamacare Medicaid expansion for more than 800,000 Michiganders. Think about this now. Some of those States, Republican governors did not expand, even though the federal government was paying for it front end. There’s millions of people have no coverage. After we passed Obamacare with the help of Debbie and Gary, Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters, we were able to reduce the uninsured rate by 55% here in Michigan. And if I have the honor of becoming your president, we’ll build on the Affordable Care Act, no matter what they do. You can choose to keep a private plan, if you still have one. Because some of the private plans negotiated, the UAW owners are good plans. But we’ll also offer you a Medicare like public health insurance option. It’ll force private insurers to keep premiums low and offer better coverage because, for the first time, they’ll have to compete for your business against a public insurer that doesn’t have the profit motive in mind. If you choose this public option or a private plan will increase subsidies for your premiums, so that they’re lower. You can afford our plans with lower deductibles, lower out-of-pocket spending. An independent analysis found that my plan will slash the cost of prescription drugs by 60%. Not a liberal think tank, serious folks looking at this. Here’s the bottom line. My plan lowers healthcare costs and gets universal coverage quickly at a time when Michigan families desperately are going to need that relief and they need it now. Families are reeling right now. They need a lifeline now. I promise you. When I’m president I’ll take care of your health coverage, the same way I would my own family. I grew up like a lot of people in this state. In Scranton, Pennsylvania and Wilmington, Delaware in a three bedroom, split level home with four kids and a grandpop living with us. I can remember how my dad, when we moved from Scranton for no work, we moved down to Delaware. He stayed with my grandpop for a year, he came home every weekend. Finally got a job. We got an apartment we lived in, and ended up being section eight housing years later, but it was decent. We were happy. It took my dad about three years to get a job good enough that he could actually buy a home. And he bought that small home at the time a suburban sprawl was going on. There were 70 homes like it, three and four bedrooms homes. But the walls were thin. I look back and I wonder how my mom and dad did it, come to think of it. I remember one night, my dad, you could hear him restlessly rolling in bed. Our bedroom was next to it. And I asked my mom the next morning, what’s wrong with Dad? She said, “Honey, it’s complicated.” I said, “What’s the matter, Mom?” I was 14 years old. She said, “Well, his company just lost his health insurance. We’re going to be okay, honey. Think of all the people rolling around in bed tonight, tomorrow night, last night. Trump doesn’t see things this way because he only sees the world from a Park Avenue perspective. I’m not being a wise guy, I’m being literal. He can only see from his penthouse, Wall Street. I see the world from where I grew up like many of you. I grew up in Scranton, as I said. My mom taught me. My mom had a backbone like a ramrod. My mom taught me. She said, “Joey, look at me, look at me.” Because I used to stutter. She said, “Nobody’s better than you, Joey, but everybody’s your equal.” That’s how I was raised. I think you and I, we measure people, whether you’re a Democrat or Republican, we measure people on the strength of their character. Honesty, decency, recognizing that some things are bigger than just your self-interest. That’s what America is about. That’s who we are. It’s about family, respect, decency, honor, opportunity. Our families and yours, we weren’t asking for anything. Just a shot, just an even shot. Given a shot, the American people have never, ever, ever, ever, ever let their country down. That’s what Michigan needs now, a shot to come back strong. That’s what you needed 10 years ago in your automobile industry, the heart and soul of Michigan was on the brink. My state used to be an auto state. Small population, we had the highest percentage of auto workers of any state in the nation because we had less than a million people. The largest General Motors and Chrysler plants outside of Michigan. But you all remember like I do. You remember what it was like yesterday. When Barack and I decided we had to bet on Michigan, remember all the blow back even from some Democrats. We can’t compete. We bet on auto workers, we bet on the UAW and they came through and it paid off. For real. The industry wasn’t in trouble because of the auto workers, it was in trouble because of management decisions. Over the objective of many, we stepped in and rescued the automobile industry, General Motors and Chrysler, saving over 1 million jobs by that one deal. Don’t ever underestimate the American worker. By contrast on Donald Trump’s watch, we were in a nationwide manufacturing recession before COVID struck. And we’re now down nearly 650,000 manufacturing jobs across the country now. Now, and it’s rising. In fact, Donald Trump will be the first president in modern American history to leave office, God willing, to leave office with fewer jobs than he had when he started in office. Last one was Herbert Hoover. For real. Folks, we can bring this economy back. I’m positive of it. I’m optimistic about it. We know how to go about doing it. An independent analysis on Wall Street, Moody’s, a well-respected Wall Street firm, has done an in-depth analysis of every aspect of my plan, as well as his. You know what their conclusion was? This is Moody’s, now. That my plan will create 18.6 million jobs, 7 million more than his would, and $1 trillion more in economic growth than the president’s plan, by investing in people. By the way, you see these ads here in Michigan, Biden’s going to raise your taxes. Once again, flat, unadulterated lie. No one who makes less than $400,000 a year will pay a penny more. If you make more than that, you’re going to start paying at the rate you paid under the administration of George W. Bush at 39.6%. But I’m going to ask big corporations and the very wealthy to pay their fair share for a change. Trump’s more than $2 trillion tax cut, I’m going to roll back 1.5 trillion of that in the giveaways to the biggest companies in the top 1%. And the money we raise, we’ll invest in working people, in growing the middle class. This time, make sure we bring everybody along. Black, white, Hispanic, disabled. Everyone comes along. Outside economists said my plan will create millions of good paying union jobs in manufacturing. We’re going to invest in building more resilient infrastructure. Remember the president said, “I have an infrastructure plan.” In 2017, and then 2018 and 2019, now 2020. He doesn’t have any plan. I’m going to build a resilient infrastructure, creating good paying jobs. Building roads and bridges and ports. One million new jobs and affordable housing units. Should be one million new affordable housing units. High-speed broadband for every household. A 100 billion dollars to rebuild our crumbling schools. One of the reasons we can’t send our kids back to schools. A lot of them aren’t even safe now. We’re going to retrofit as we started our administration when the president allowed me to run the recovery act. We’re going to retrofit four million buildings and weatherize two billion homes. That alone will save 100s of thousands of millions of barrels of oil. It’s all going to be done by certified union labor. I’m going to end Trump’s incentives. He talks about his trade deals. As Gary and Debbie know in his trade deals he incentivized people to send jobs abroad. Abroad. More taking their jobs overseas. One thing more the United States Government owns and maintains enormous fleet of vehicles. I promise you, the president controls that. I’m going to convert those government fleets into clean vehicles made of and sourced right here in the United States of America. I’m going to expand the capacity so the United States, not China leads the world in clean vehicle production. We’re going to make it easier to America’s companies to switch from fuel inefficient vehicles. We’re going to build a network of 500,000 charging stations all across the country. Offer consumer rebates to swap old or fuel inefficient vehicles for new clean American made models. Together, this will mean according to the estimates, more than a million good new jobs in the American auto release, because we will own the electric vehicle market in the world. Folks I guarantee you, we can do this, but we have to come together. I remember you and I talking gov when I was running for the nomination in my same way to unite the country. You’re the only one whp thought I was right. That used to be the old days. Yeah, Joe, you got a lot done. You used to walk across to get a lot done, but everything’s changed. Well folks, if we can’t unite the country, we’re in trouble. America and our system runs on consensus. Compromise is not a dirty word. I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I’m going to govern as an American president. I’ll work as hard for those who don’t support me as those who do. I do not see American terms of red and blue. Bringing the country together, that’s the job of a president. It’s a duty to care. To care for everybody. We can be so much better than what we see. We can be what you are at our best, when we’re the United States of America. Folks, you have to vote and people are turning out here in this state and overwhelming numbers around the country.

Folks, this time I really mean this to restore the soul of America. To rebuild the backbone of this country, the middle class. This time is I’d bring everybody along. Debbie, may remember my colleagues in the caucus used to wonder kid me because I quote President Kennedy. When he was about going to the moon and famous speech, everybody remembers the different parts of it. The line I remember more than anything else. He answered the question that wasn’t, it was implicitly being asked, “Why are you doing this?” He said, “Because we’d refused to postpone. I refuse to postpone the work America must do now to bring this country back. There’s nothing beyond our capacity. There’s no limit to American future. The only thing that can tear America part is America itself. No other country can do that. Everybody knows who Donald Trump is. Well, we have to let them know who we are. What we stand for, we choose hope over fear, unity over division, science over fiction. And yes, truth over lies. Folks thank you and may God bless you and may God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."
"128","10-18-20"," I tell you what. Thanks for sharing your story and it’s what this country’s all about. You’re making your family proud, man. And I wanted to talk, I want to thank the speakers ahead of me. Commissioner, soon to be commissioner Jessica Holmes, where are you Jessica? I know you’re here somewhere. And also state Representative Yvonne Holly, Lewis-Holley. She’s here. Zach Hawkins. Folks, and a great coach, Coach Lawson. I tell you what. My granddaughter’s with me today. And she went to a school that Coach Lawson went to for a little while in Washington. And apparently Coach telling me she’s recruiting some of the girl’s basketball team from where my granddaughter went to school. And she showed me Coach, she showed me a video you were doing for your team, where you made the distinction between competing and winning, the heart of winning and competing. And you talked about, though, working hard and competing. And everybody you pointed out works hard. But you said working hard is absolutely essential, but competing is even more consequential. You can work hard, but did you compete with everything you had? Competing because you know what’s at stake, what is at the heart of winning. My good friends, Congressman, excuse me, G.K. Butterfield and David Price, who represent the first and fourth districts with decency and honor, they can tell you we’re doing both, working hard and we’re competing like we never did before because so much is at stake for this nation. The very soul of the nation is at stake. Folks, as my coaches used to say in college, it’s go time. It’s the most important election in our lifetimes. We’re going to make all the difference here in North Carolina. The choice is clear as it’s ever been. And the stakes have never been higher. The stakes of this election, remind me of something my dad used to say when he lost job up in Scranton, Pennsylvania when I was a kid, when coal died and he moved down to Delaware. He used to always say, “Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. That’s right. “It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in the community.” Then he said, it’s the God’s truth, if I heard it once I heard it 20 times. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, “Honey, it’s going to be okay.” That’s a lesson I’ve never forgotten. When I grew up surrounded by a lot of hard work and folks in Scranton, Pennsylvania and Claymont, Delaware were we moved. How many people today though, think they can look their kid in the eye right now and say, “It’s going to be okay,” and mean it. So many people are hurting. Over half the people in America say if they got a bill for $400 they didn’t expect in one month, they wouldn’t be able to pay it. They’d have to borrow the money or they’d have to sell something. Folks, times are hard, unemployment’s way up. Just this week, 1,200,000 people filed for unemployment. Folks are worried about making their next mortgage payment or rent payment. Whether their healthcare will be ripped away in the middle of a pandemic. Worried about sending their kids to school, worried about not sending their kids to school. They see folks at the top, they’re doing better than ever while they’re left to wonder, “Who’s looking out for me. Well, that’s Donald Trump’s presidency. More than 217,000 Americans dead because of COVID-19. Nearly 4,000 here in the state of North Carolina. On Friday, we saw the highest number of new cases in one day since July. In the last two days, worst day since July. Yet, the other night Trump said in one of his rallies, “We’ve turned the corner. Yeah, Joe. Joe [inaudible 00:04:39]. Turn the corner? Things are getting worse. He continues to lie to us about the circumstances. Experts say we’re likely to lose as many as 200,000 additional lives nationwide between now and the end of the year. All because this President cares more about his Park Avenue perspective on the world, the stock market, than he does about you. Because he refuses to follow the science. It’s estimated that if we just wore masks, if we just wore masks, we’d save between now and the end of the year, a hundred thousand lives. His own head of the CDC said that. And you know what? What’s really sad about this? The President knew how dangerous this virus was all the way back in January. Yeah. And he hid it from the country. He’s on record. He told Bob Woodward in a taped interview that the disease was deadly, much worse than the flu. And here’s what he did. According to the New York Times three, four days ago, his Administration gave Wall Street investors, a head’s up, but he didn’t tell us, just his friends on Wall Street. That’s why they made so much money by “selling short.” Well who got sold short, y’all got sell short. And you know what’s coming. But what happened to the rest of us? He tried to claim with Woodward, he didn’t want to panic the American people. The American people do not panic, Trump panicked. Send him home, Joe. Send him home. And his selfish behavior is no surprise. After all, this is the same man who looks at Americans who put their lives on the line for this nation, like so many tens of thousands here in North Carolina have done. Like my son Beau did after a year in Iraq, winning the Bronze Star, conspicuous service medal, he looks at them, he calls them suckers and losers. Who the hell does he think he’s talking about? These are our heroes. They are the people who have sacrificed. They’re the backbone of this country. And now as a consequence of all this overwhelming lying, negligent, and irresponsible action has come, how many chairs were empty at the dining room table last night because of his negligence? Folks, we’re so much better than this. Despite the crisis we face, we have enormous opportunity if we just build. We can build back better. We just got to stand up and take it back. Look, we can build an economy that gets everyone a fair return on their work, an equal chance to get ahead. For example, the communities of color here in North Carolina and across the country. The question is, how do we break that cycle where in good times you lag behind. In bad times, you get hit the hardest and first. And in recovery, the last to bounce back. Well, the answer is about justice, criminal justice, police reform. I know this nation is strong enough to do both, honestly face systemic racism and provide safe streets for our families and small businesses, that too often bear the brunt of looting and burning. We have no need for our armed militias roaming America’s streets. This is the United States of America. And we should have no tolerance for extremist white supremacist group marching, menacing our communities. But what, but if you say we have no need face racial injustice in this country, as he says, you haven’t opened your eyes to the truth. There’ve been powerful voices for justice in recent months. George Floyd’s six year old daughter, who I met with in the family. I knelt down to say hi to her. And she looked at me, she said, “Mr. Vice President, daddy changed the world. Daddy changed the world.” Jacob Blake’s mother, with whom I met, said violence didn’t her son and this nation needs healing. And then said she prayed for the police officers. [inaudible 00:09:00] Joe. Amen. Doc Rivers, a basketball coach, choking back tears when he said, “We’re the ones getting killed. We’re the ones getting shot. We’ve been hung. It’s amazing why we keep loving this country and this country doesn’t love us back.” Think about that. Think about what it takes to be a Black person to love this country today as it does, its deep love for this country. And for much too long it hadn’t been recognized. We need leadership to deescalate tensions, open lines of communication and brings us together. To heal and to hope. As president that’s precisely what I’ll do. But true justice is also about jobs, good paying jobs, financial stability. It was right here in Durham, on Parrish Street a century ago that an oasis of black owned businesses thrived, even in the era of Jim Crow. Parrish Street was one of the first examples of flourishing black middle-class community in America. A place that offered the country a glimpse of what we could become if we chose to live up to our founding values. Giving families of color a real shot at a home, start a small business, send a child to college debt free so they can build wealth and pass opportunity down through generations. That’s what built every other middle-class group in America. That’s how we deliver equality and equity. Another example, more and more women are dropping out of the workforce in this recession, whether in cities or in suburbs. I have a plan to deal with this pandemic. Responsibly testing, tracing, masking, not politicizing a race for a vaccine, planning for its safe and equitable distribution. Providing funding for PPE and other resources for schools to reopen safely. Easing the caregiving crisis so many families are experiencing, squeezed between raising your kids and caring for an aging, loved one. And protecting your health care. I’ll tell you why. For real not hyperbole, I’ll tell you why. It’s about wiping Obamacare off the books. That’s what it’s about. Because their nominee has said in the past the law should be struck down. If they get their way, 100 million Americans will lose their protections for pre-existing conditions. Complications of COVID-19, over 7 million people infected will become the next preexisting condition, allowing insurers to jack up your premiums or deny your coverage altogether. And women will again be charged more for their health just because they are women. Folks, we can do so much better. I will build on the Affordable Care Act so you can keep your private insurance. You can choose a Medicare like option. We’re going to increase subsidies that lower your premiums and deductibles [inaudible 00:12:18] out of pocket spending. Look, your governor has been working hard to expand Medicaid, but it’s being blocked by Republican legislature. My plan will automatically enroll 357,000 uninsured North Carolinans in a public option for free, automatically. And it’s going to make a life-changing difference for so many families. But we can only do any of this if we come together as a country. We need to revive the spirit of bipartisanship in this country. A spirit of being able to work with one another. When I say that, and I said that from the moment I announced, I’m told that, “Well, maybe that’s you used to be able to do that, Joe. That was your reputation when you were in the Senate and Vice President. But things have changed. They don’t work that way anymore.” Well, I’m here to tell you they can and they will and they must if we’re going to get anything done in America. We love you, Joe. We love you, Joe. I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president. No red states, no blue States, just the United States. I promise you. I’ll work as hard for those who don’t support me as those who did. That’s the job of a president, a duty to care, to care for everyone in America. Folks, and you too have a sacred duty. To vote. And it matters. North Carolina matters. And Senator Harris and I are asking you for your trust and support. We’ll always have your back, I promise you. So please, please vote and help get out the vote. Go to iwillvote.com/nc. Early voting started on Thursday. We got to keep the incredible momentum going. We can’t let up. You can vote early in person until the 31st. But don’t wait, go vote today and don’t just vote for me and Senator Harris. You’ve got a governor’s race, a Senate race, a record number of black women on the ballot. Congress and lieutenant governor. Labor commissioner and the courts. Folks, they’re ready to deliver for North Carolina families. So vote, vote. It’s time. It really is time. When I announced my candidacy, I hadn’t planned on running again to be very blunt. And I’ve said it before. My son had just died and I had no interest. And then I saw those folks coming out of the fields in Charlottesville, carrying torches. Close your eyes, remember what it looked like. They’re veins bulging, shouting anti-Semitic bile. The same bile that was shouted in the streets of Germany in the thirties. Carrying Nazi flags, accompanied by the Ku Klux Klan. And a young woman was killed that was protesting the opposite direction. And when asked to comment, this President said something no other president has ever said in the history of the United States of America. He said, “There were very fine people on both sides. Very fine people. Folks, I mean it when I say this it’s time to restore America’s soul. It’s time to rebuild the backbone of America, the middle class. And this time, bring everybody along. No matter your race, your age, your religion, your gender, ethnicity, or disability. We can do this. The blinders have been taken off the American people and they’ve seen what’s happened. It’s time to unite America. Look, I’ll never forget what President Kennedy said when I was a kid and we’re going to the moon. Every kid in the school had to hear his speech. He used the line in that speech my Senate colleagues and the White House heard me use all the time, it made the most impression on me. He asked the unasked question, “Why are we doing this?” And his response was, he said, “Because we refuse to postpone. This is America. We refuse to postpone America’s work that must be done. Yeah, Joe. Yeah, Joe. There’s nothing beyond our capacity. We have never, never, never, never failed. There’s no limit on our future. The only thing that can tear America part is America itself. Everybody knows who Donald Trump is. So let’s let them know who we are. We choose hope over fear. We choose unity over division. Science over fiction. And yes, we choose truth over lies. So folks, it’s time to stand up. Stand up and take back our democracy. No more time left. God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."
"129","10-21-20"," Hello, Philadelphia. Man, it is good to be back in Pennsylvania. What beautiful weather we got here. Little Indian summer. I know the president spent some time in Erie last night, and apparently he complained about having to travel here. And then he cut the event short, poor guy. I don’t feel that way. I love coming to Pennsylvania. You guys delivered for me twice and I am back here tonight to ask you to deliver the White House for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. I want to thank Mr. Philadelphia, Charlie Mack, his daughter, India Marie. What an outstanding young lady she was. Those of you who are fathers and have daughters you know how that feels when you see your daughters just shining. I know a little bit about that. And it was great to see representatives, Brendan Boyle, Mary Gay Scanlon, Governor Tom Wolf, Attorney General Josh Shapiro, Mayor Jim Kenney. Philadelphia we got 13 days. That’s our lucky number right here. 13 days until the most important election of our lifetimes. And you don’t have to wait for November 3rd to cast your ballot. You’ve got two ways to vote right now. Number one, you can vote early in person through next Tuesday. Anybody here voted early already? If you haven’t, just go to iwillvote.com/pa and find out where you can vote early. Number two, you can vote from home with a mail-in ballot. Just go to iwillvote.com/pa to request your ballot right away. And before you send it back, Pennsylvania’s got this thing where you’ve got to use both envelopes. So you’ve got to read the directions carefully to make sure your vote counts. And if you’ve already voted, then you’ve got to help your friends and family make a plan to vote. Take them with you if you vote early, or if you vote in-person on election day, because this election requires every single one of us to do our part. And what we do these next 13 days will matter for decades to come. Now, last time I was in Philadelphia, I was at the constitution center and I was delivering a speech for the Democratic National Convention this year. And I said, during that speech, I’ve sat in the Oval Office with both of the men who are running for president. And they are very different people. I explained that I never thought Donald Trump would embrace my vision or continue my policies but I did hope for the sake of the country that he might show some interest in taking the job seriously, but it hasn’t happened. He hasn’t shown any interest in doing the work or helping anybody but himself and his friends or treating the presidency like a reality show that he can use to get attention. And by the way, even then his TV ratings are down. So you know that upsets him. But the thing is, this is not a reality show, this is reality. And the rest of us have had to live with the consequences of him proving himself incapable of taking the job seriously. At least 220,000 Americans have died. More than 100,000 small businesses have closed. Millions of jobs are gone. Our proud reputation around the world is in tatters. Presidents up for reelection usually ask if the country is better off than it was four years ago. I’ll tell you one thing, four years ago you’d be tailgating here at the Lincoln instead of watching a speech from your cars. The only people truly better off than they were four years ago are the billionaires who got his tax cuts. Right now as we speak, Trump won’t even extend relief to the millions of families who are having trouble paying the rent or putting food on the table because of this pandemic. But he’s been doing all right by himself. As it turns out, this was just reported in the last 48 hours. We know that he continues to do business with China because he’s got a secret Chinese bank account. How is that possible? How is that possible? A secret Chinese bank account. Listen, can you imagine if I had had a secret Chinese bank account when I was running for reelection. You think Fox News might have been a little concerned about that? They would’ve called me Beijing Berry. It is not a great idea to have a president who owes a bunch of money to people overseas. That’s not a good idea. I mean, of the taxes Donald Trump pays, he may be sending more to foreign governments than he pays in the United States. His first year in the White House he only paid $750 in federal income tax. Listen, my first job was at a Baskin Robbins when I was 15 years old. I think I’m might have paid more taxes that year working at a dispensing ice cream. How is that possible? How many people here pay less than that? It’s just possible now that if you are living high on the hog and you only pay $750 in taxes that maybe, just maybe he might not know what working people are going through here in Pennsylvania. We cannot afford four more years of this, Philadelphia. But the good news is right now you can choose change. Right now you can vote for my friend Joe Biden and his running mate, Kamala Harris as the next president and vice president of the United States of America. Now, Joe’s no stranger to here. He’s a native son. Scrappy kid from scratch. You know him and he knows you. But let me, let me tell you how I came to Norman and how I came to love him. 12 years ago, when I chose Joe Biden as my vice presidential running mate, I didn’t know Joe all that well. We had served in the Senate together, but we weren’t super close. He and I came from different places. We came from different generations. But I came to admire Joe as a man who has learned early on to treat everybody he meets with dignity and respect, living by the words his parents taught him, no one’s better than you Joe, but you’re better than nobody. And that empathy, that decency, that belief that everybody counts, that’s who Joe is. That’s who he’ll be. And I can tell you the presidency doesn’t change who you are, it reveals who you are. And Joe has shown himself to be a friend of working people. For eight years, Joe was the last one in the room when I faced a big decision. He made me a better president and he’s got the character and experience to make us a better country. A better country. And he and Kamala are going to be in the fight, not for themselves but for every single one of us. Well, I get that this president wants full credit for the economy he inherited and zero blame for the pandemic that he ignored. But you know what? The job doesn’t work that way. Tweeting at the television doesn’t fix things. Making stuff up doesn’t make people’s lives better. You’ve got to have a plan. You’ve got to put in the work. And along with the experience to get things done, Joe Biden has concrete plans and policies that will turn our vision of a better, fairer, stronger country into a reality. We literally left this White House a pandemic playbook that would have shown them how to respond before the virus reached our shores. They probably used it to I don’t know, prop up a wobbly table somewhere. We don’t know where that playbook went. Eight months into this pandemic, cases are rising again across this country. Donald Trump isn’t suddenly going to protect all of us. He can’t even take the basic steps to protect himself. Just last night, he complained up in eerie that the pandemic made him go back to work. I’m quoting him. He was upset that the pandemic’s made him go back to work. If he’d actually been working the whole time, it never would’ve gotten this bad. So, look, here’s the truth. I want to be honest here. This pandemic would have been challenging for any president but this idea that somehow this White House has done anything but completely screw this up. It’s just not true. I’ll give you a very specific example. Korea identified it’s first case at the same time that the United States did. At the same time, their per capita death toll is just 1.3% of what ours is. In Canada, it’s just 39% of what ours is. Other countries are still struggling with the pandemic but they’re not doing as bad as we are because they’ve got a government that’s actually been paying attention. And that means lives lost. And that means an economy that doesn’t work. And just yesterday, when asked if he’d do anything differently, Trump said, “Not much.” Really? Not much? Nothing you can think of that could have helped some people keep their loved ones alive? So, Joe’s not going to screw up testing. He’s not going to call scientists idiots. He’s not going to host a super spreader event at the White House. Joe will get this pandemic under control with a plan to make testing free and widely available, to get a vaccine to every American cost free and to make sure our frontline heroes never ask other countries for their equipment they need. His plan will guarantee paid sick leave for workers and parents affected by the pandemic and make sure that the small businesses that hold our communities together and employ millions of Americans can reopen safely. Donald Trump likes to claim he built this economy but America created 1.5 million more jobs in the last three years of the Obama-Biden administration than in the first three years of the Trump-Pence administration. How you figure that? And that was before he could blame the pandemic. Now, he did inherit the longest streak of job growth in American history but just like everything else he inherited, he messed it up. The economic damage he inflicted by botching the pandemic response means he will be the first president since Herbert Hoover to actually lose jobs. Joe’s got a plan to create 10 million good clean energy jobs as part of a historic $2 trillion investment to fight climate change, to secure environmental justice. And he’ll pay for it by rolling back that tax cut for billionaires. And Joe sees this moment not just as a chance to get back to where we were but to finally make long overdue changes so that our economy actually makes life a little easier for everybody, the waitress trying to raise her kid on her own, the student trying to figure out how to pay for next semester’s classes, the shift worker who’s always on the edge of getting laid off, the cancer survivor who’s worried about her preexisting conditions, protections being taken away. Let me tell you something Pennsylvania. This I know to be true, Joe and Kamala will protect your healthcare and expand Medicare and make insurance more affordable for everybody. Republicans love to say right before an election that they’ll protect your preexisting conditions. Now, Joe and I actually protected your policies to make sure people with preexisting conditions could get health insurance and have coverage. We did it through something called the Affordable Care Act, a.k.a Obamacare. And Republicans tried to repeal or undermine it more than 60 times. And when they’ve been asked about, they keep on promising, “We’re going to have a great replacement.” They said, “It’s coming.” It’s been coming in two weeks for the last 10 years. Where is it? Where is this great plan to replace Obamacare? They’ve had 10 years to do it. There is no plan. They’ve never had one. Instead they’ve attacked the Affordable Care Act at every turn, driving up costs, driving up the uninsured. Now, they’re trying to dismantle your care in the Supreme court as we speak as quickly as they can in the middle of a pandemic with nothing but empty promises to take its place. It’s shameful. The idea that you would take healthcare away from people at the very moment where people need it most, what is the logic of that? There is no logic. Joe knows that the first job of a president is to keep us safe from all threats, foreign, domestic or microscopic. When the daily intelligence briefings flash warning signs about a virus, a president can’t ignore them. He can’t be AWOL. Just like when Russia puts bounties on the heads of our soldiers in Afghanistan, the commander-in-chief can’t be missing in action. I can tell you this, Joe Biden would never call the men and women of our military suckers or losers. Who does that? He knows these heroes are somebody’s children, somebody’s spouse, somebody’s dad or mom. He understands that. And he’s going to restore our standing in the world because he knows that America’s true strength comes from setting an example that the world wants to follow. A nation that stands with democracy, not dictators, a nation that can mobilize and inspire others to overcome threats like climate change and terrorism and poverty and disease. And with Joe and Kamala at the helm, you’re not going to have to think about the crazy things they said every day. And that’s worth a lot. You’re not going to have to argue about them every day. It just won’t be so exhausting. You might be able to have a Thanksgiving dinner without having an argument. You’ll be able to go about your lives knowing that the president is not going to retweet conspiracy theories about secret cabals running the world or that maybe seals didn’t actually kill bin Laden. Think about that. The president of the United States retweeted that. Imagine. What? What? We’re not going to have a president that goes out of his way to insult anybody who doesn’t support him or threaten them with jail. That’s not normal presidential behavior. That’s not normal presidential behavior. We wouldn’t tolerate it from a high school principal. We wouldn’t tolerate it from a coach. We wouldn’t tolerate it from a co-worker. We wouldn’t tolerate it in our family, except for maybe crazy uncle somewhere. I mean, why would we expect and accept this from the President of the United States? And why are folks making excuses for that? “Oh, well, that’s just him.” No. There are consequences to these actions. They embolden other people to be cruel and divisive and racist, and it frays the fabric of our society, and it affects how our children see things. And it affects the ways that our families get along. It affects how the world looks at America. That behavior matters. Character matters. And by the way, while he’s doing all that, it distracts all of us from the truly destructive actions that his appointees are doing all across the government, actions that affect your lives. The Environmental Protection Agency that’s supposed to protect our air and our water is right now run by an energy lobbyist that gives polluters free reign to dump unlimited poison into our air and water. The Labor Department that’s supposed to protect workers and their rights, right now it’s run by a corporate lobbyist who’s declared war on workers, guts protections to keep essential folks safe during a pandemic, makes it easier for big corporations to shortchange them on their wages. The Interior Department, that’s supposed to protect our public lands and wild spaces, our wildlife and our wilderness. And right now that’s run by an oil lobbyist who’s determined to sell them to the highest bidder. You’ve got the Education Department that’s supposed to give every kid a chance, and that’s run by a billionaire who guts rules designed to protect students from getting ripped off by for profit colleges and stiffs arm students looking for loan relief in the middle of an economic collapse. I mean, the person who runs Medicaid right now is doing their best to kick people off of Medicaid instead of sign them up for Medicaid. Come on. When Joe and Kamala are in charge, they’re not going to surround themselves with hacks and lobbyists, but they’re going to appoint qualified public servants who actually care about looking out for you, for your job, for your family, for your health, for your security, for your planet, and that more than anything is what separates them from their opponents. They actually care about every American, including the ones that don’t agree with them. And they’re going to fight for you every day. They care about you and they care about this democracy. They believe in a democracy. The right to vote is sacred and that we shouldn’t be making people wait in line for 10 hours to cast their ballot. We should be making it easier for everybody to vote. They believe that no one, especially the President, is above the law. They understand that protest on behalf of social justice isn’t un-American. That’s the most American thing there is. That’s how this country was founded, protesting injustice. They understand we don’t threaten our political opponents threatening to throw them in jail, just because we disagree with them. They understand that our ability to work together to solve big problems like a pandemic depends more than on just photo-ops. It depends on actually learning the facts and following the science and not just making stuff up whenever it’s convenient. Our democracy is not going to work if the people who are supposed to be our leaders lie every day and just make things up. And we’ve just become numb to it. We’ve just become immune to it. Every single day, fact checkers can’t keep up. And, look, this notion of truthfulness and democracy and citizenship, and being responsible, these aren’t Republican or democratic principles, they’re American principles. They’re what most of us grew up learning from our parents and our grandparents. They’re not White or Black or Latino or Asian values, they’re American values, human values, and we need to reclaim them. We have to get those values back at the center of our public life. And we can. But to do it, we’ve got to turn out like never before. We cannot leave any doubt in this election, because you know the President’s already said, “If this is even close, I’m going to just make stuff up.” He’s already started to do it. So we can’t have any doubt. We can’t be complacent. I don’t care about the polls. There were a whole bunch of polls last time, didn’t work out, because a whole bunch of folks stayed at home and got lazy and complacent. Not this time, not in this election, not this time. Listen, listen. I understand why a lot of Americans can get frustrated by government and can feel like it doesn’t make a difference. Even supporters of mine, during my eight years, there were times where stuff we wanted to get done didn’t get done and people said, “Well, gosh, if Obama didn’t get it done, then maybe it’s just not going to happen.” Look, government is not going to solve every problem, it’s true. Every elected officials going to make some mistakes. This is a big complicated country and the system’s designed so that change happens slowly. It doesn’t happen overnight. And believe me, I’ve got firsthand experience with the way Republicans in Congress abused the rules to make it easy for special interest to stop progress. But we can make things better, and we shouldn’t be making things worse. A president by himself can’t solve every challenge in a global economy. But if we’ve got Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in the White House at a House and Senate that are focused on working people, it can make a difference and get millions of people the help they need. A president by himself can’t eliminate all racial bias in our criminal justice system. But if we’ve got district attorneys and state’s attorneys and sheriffs and police chiefs focused on equality and justice, it can make things better. In Pennsylvania, you’ve just got to flip nine seats in your State House, just five seats in your State Senate, to give Democrats control and new life for policies that’ll make a real difference to working families right now. It can make things better. In the end, Pennsylvania, that’s what voting’s about, making things better, not making things perfect, but putting us on track so that a generation from now we can look back and say, “Things got better starting now.” And that’s what voting’s about. Voting’s about using the power we have and pooling it together to get a government that’s more concerned and more responsive and more focused on you and your lives and your children and your grandchildren and future generations. … and future generations. And the fact that we don’t get 100% of what we want right away is not a good reason not to vote. It means we’ve got to vote and then get some change and then vote some more and then get some more change, and then keep on voting until we get it right. And we will never come close to seeing what it would be like if everybody voted, when I hear people say, “Well, I don’t know, you’re voting don’t make a difference.” We don’t know because usually no more than half the people who could be voting vote. We get 50, 55% of people voting. And then people say, “Well, look, not enough change happened.” Well, imagine what would happen if 60% voted? What about 70%? Imagine January 20th, when we swear in a president and a vice president who have a plan to get us out of this mess, who believe in science, and they have a plan to protect this planet for our kids, and who care about working Americans, and they have a plan to help you start getting ahead. And who believe in racial equality and gender equality, and believe in not discriminating against people because of their sexual orientation, and are willing to bring us closer to an America where no matter what we look like and where we come from, who we love and what our last name is, if we go out there and we work, we can make it. And we’re part of an American family. All of that is possible. All of that is within our reach, if we vote. And I tell him, I say, look for all the times, these last four years that we’ve seen our worst impulses revealed, we’ve also seen what our country can be at its best. We’ve seen folks of every age and background who’ve packed city centers and airports in town squares, just so families wouldn’t be separated. So another classroom wouldn’t get shot up, so our kids wouldn’t grow up on an uninhabitable planet. We’ve seen Americans more racist, joining together to declare in the face of injustice that black lives matter, no more, but no less, so that no child in this country feels the continuing sting of racism. We’ve seen folks, our essential workers, our healthcare workers risking their lives day in day out to save somebody else’s loved ones. We’ve seen people volunteer and contribute to help those who are having an especially difficult time that right now. That’s true in Pennsylvania, that’s true all across the country. America is a good and decent place, but we’ve just seen so much noise and nonsense that sometimes it’s hard for us to remember. Philadelphia, I’m asking you to remember what this country can be. What it’s like when we treat each other with respect and dignity, what it’s like when our elected officials actually behave responsibly. I’m asking you to believe in Joe’s ability, in Kamala’s ability to lead this country out of these dark times, and help us build it back better, because we can’t abandon those who are hurting right now. We can’t abandon the children who aren’t getting the education they need right now. We can’t abandon those protesters who inspired us. We’ve got to channel their activism into action, we can’t just imagine a better future. We’ve got to fight for it. We’ve got to out hustle the other side, we got to outwork the other side, we’ve got to vote like never before and leave no doubt. So make a plan right now, for how you’re going to get involved and vote. Do it as early as you can. Tell your family, tell your friends how they can vote. Don’t stop with Joe and Kamala, make sure you vote all the way down the ticket. And if we pour all our efforts into these 13 days, if we vote up and down the ticket, like never before, then we will not only elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, we will also leave no doubt about what this country that we love stands for. We will not leave any doubt about who we are as a people, and the values and ideals that we embrace. What Lincoln called the better angels of our nature, those are still in us. We see them operating every single day. We see them in neighborhoods, we see them in churches and synagogues and mosques and temples. We see them in people helping out a neighbor. We see them them inside our own families. We see that what is best in us is still there, but we’ve got to give it voice, and we’ve got to do it now. So let’s get to work people. Let’s bring this home. I love you, Philadelphia. Honk if you’re fired up, honk if you’re ready to go. Yeah. Yeah. Let’s go make it happen. I love you Philadelphia. Thank you. I love you. Come on."
"130","10-22-20"," Good evening, everyone. Good evening. Thank you so much for being here. It is such an honor for me to moderate this debate tonight, the final debate. I want to welcome the first family and the first lady. We’re so glad and thankful that you are feeling better. I want to welcome the Biden family, Dr. Jill Biden. Thank you all for being here tonight. We are so excited. We’re looking forward to a really robust discussion. And the only thing I would reiterate are the CPD guidelines that when the candidates are talking, please hold any applause or any other reactions. Except of course, when they walk out, make sure you cheer and loud and applause so that everyone can hear you. Thank you for having me. This is really the honor of a lifetime. I am going to sit down and just get organized and get settled and the show will start very soon. Thank you for being here. (silence). Good evening from Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee. I’m Kristen Welker of NBC News. And I welcome you to the final 2020 presidential debate between President Donald J. Trump and former vice president Joe Biden. Tonight’s debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. It is conducted under health and safety protocols designed by the Commission’s health security advisor. The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent. No cheers, boos, or other interruptions, except right now, as we welcome to the stage, former vice president Joe Biden and President Donald J. Trump. And I do want to say a very good evening to both of you. This debate will cover six major topics. At the beginning of each section, each candidate will have two minutes, uninterrupted, to answer my first question. The Debate Commission will then turn on their microphone only when it is their turn to answer. And the Commission will turn it off exactly when the two minutes have expired. After that, both microphones will remain on. But on behalf of the voters, I’m going to ask you to please speak one at a time. The goal is for you to hear each other and for the American people to hear every word of what you both have to say. And so with that, if you’re ready, let’s start. And we will begin with the fight against the coronavirus. President Trump, the first question is for you. The country is heading into a dangerous new phase. More than 40,000 Americans are in the hospital tonight with COVID, including record numbers here in Tennessee. And since the two of you last shared a stage, 16,000 Americans have died from COVID. So please be specific. How would you lead the country during this next stage of the coronavirus crisis? Two minutes, uninterrupted. … during this next stage of the coronavirus crisis. Two minutes uninterrupted. So as you know, 2.2 million people modeled out, were expected to die. We closed up the greatest economy in the world in order to fight this horrible disease that came from China. It’s a worldwide pandemic. It’s all over the world. You see the spikes in Europe and many other places right now. If you notice, the mortality rate is down 85%. The excess mortality rate is way down and much lower than almost any other country. And we’re fighting it and we’re fighting it hard. There is a spike. There was a spike in Florida and it’s now gone. There was a very big spike in Texas. It’s now gone. There was a very big spike in Arizona. It’s now gone. And there was some spikes and surges and other places, they will soon be gone. We have a vaccine that’s coming. It’s ready. It’s going to be announced within weeks. And it’s going to be delivered. We have Operation Warp Speed, which is the military is going to distribute the vaccine. I can tell you from personal experience, I was in the hospital. I had it and I got better. And I will tell you that I had something that they gave me, a therapeutic, I guess they would call it. Some people could say it was a cure, but I was in for a short period of time. And I got better very fast or I wouldn’t be here tonight. And now they say I’m immune. Whether it’s four months or a lifetime, nobody’s been able to say that, but I’m immune. More and more people are getting better. We have a problem that’s a worldwide problem. This is a worldwide problem, but I’ve been congratulated by the heads of many countries on what we’ve been able to do. If you take a look at what we’ve done in terms of goggles and masks and gowns and everything else, and in particular ventilators we’re now making ventilators all over the world, thousands and thousands a month distributing them all over the world. It will go away. And as I say, we’re rounding the turn. We’re rounding the corner. It’s going away. Okay. Former Vice President Biden to you. How would you lead the country out of this crisis? You have two minutes uninterrupted. 220,000 Americans dead. You hear nothing else I say tonight, hear this. Anyone who is responsible for not taking control. In fact, not saying I take no responsibility initially. Anyone is responsible for that many deaths should not remain as president of the United States of America. We’re in a situation where there are a thousand deaths a day now. A thousand deaths a day. And there are over 70,000 new cases per day. Compared to what’s going on in Europe as the New England Medical Journal said, they’re starting from a very low rate. We’re starting from a very high rate. The expectation is we’ll have another 200,000 Americans dead between now and the end of the year. If we just wore these masks, the president’s own advisors have told him, we can save a 100,000 lives. And we’re in a circumstance where the president thus far and still has no plan, no comprehensive plan. What I would do is make sure we have everyone encouraged to wear a mask all the time. I would make sure we move into the direction of rapid testing, investing in rapid testing. I would make sure that we set up national standards as to how to open up schools and open up businesses so they can be safe and give them the wherewithal, the financial resources to be able to do that. We’re in a situation now where the New England Medical Journal, one of the serious, most serious journals in the whole world said for the first time ever that the way this president has responded to this crisis has been absolutely tragic. And so folks, I will take care of this. I will end this. I will make sure we have a plan. President Trump, I’d like to follow up with you and your comments. You talked about taking a therapeutic, I assume you’re referencing Regeneron. You also said a vaccine will be coming within weeks. No, it’s not a guarantee, but it will be by the end of the year. But I think it has a good chance. There are two companies, I think within a matter of weeks and it will be distributed very quickly. Johnson & Johnson is doing very well. Moderna is doing very well. Pfizer is doing very well and we have numerous others. Then we also have others that we’re working on very closely with other countries, in particular Europe. Let me follow up with you and because this is new information. You have set a vaccine is coming soon within weeks now. Your own officials say, “It could take well into 2021 at the earliest for enough Americans to get vaccinated.” And even then they say, “The country will be wearing masks and distancing into 2022. No, I think my timeline is going to be more accurate. I don’t know that they’re counting on the military the way I do, but we have our generals lined up, one in particular that’s the head of logistics and this is a very easy distribution for him. He’s ready to go. As soon as we have the vaccine and we expect to have a 100 million vials. As soon as we have the vaccine, he’s ready to go. Vice President Biden, your reaction. And just 40% of Americans say they would definitely agree to take a coronavirus vaccine if it was approved by the government. Make sure it’s totally transparent. Have the scientists of the world see it, know it, look at it, go through all the processes. And by the way, this is the same fellow who told you, “This is going to end by Easter” last time. This is the same fellow who told you that, “Don’t worry, we’re going to end this by the summer.” We’re about to go into a dark winter, a dark winter and he has no clear plan. And there’s no prospect that there’s going to be a vaccine available for the majority of the American people before the middle of next year. President Trump, your reaction. He says, you have no plan. I don’t think we’re going to have a dark winter at all. We’re opening up our country. We’ve learned and studied and understand the disease, which we didn’t at the beginning. When I closed and banned China from coming in heavily infected and then ultimately Europe, but China was in January. Months later, he was saying I was xenophobic. I did it too soon. Now he’s saying, “Oh, I should have moved quicker,” but he didn’t move quicker. He was months behind me, many months behind me. And frankly, he ran the H1N1 swine flu and it was a total disaster. Far less lethal, but it was a total disaster. Had that had this kind of numbers, 700,000 people would be dead right now, but it was a far less lethal disease. Look, his own person who ran that for him, who, as you know, was his chief of staff said, “It was catastrophic. It was horrible. We didn’t know what we were doing.” Now he comes up and he tells us how to do this. Also, everything that he said about the way every single move that he said we should make, that’s what we’ve done. We’ve done all of it. But he was way behind us. Vice President Biden, your response. My response is he is xenophobic, but not because he shutdown access from China. And he did it late after 40 countries had already done that. In addition to that, what he did, he made sure that we had 44 people that were in there in China trying to get the Wuhan to determine what exactly the source was. What did the president say in January? He said, ” No.” He said, “He’s being transparent. The president of China is being transparent. We owe him a debt of gratitude. We have to thank him. And then what happened was we started talking about using the Defense Act to make sure we go out and get whatever is needed out there to protect people. And again, I go back to this. He had nothing, he did virtually nothing. And then he gets out of the hospital and he talks about, “Oh, don’t worry. It’s all going to be over soon.” Come on. There’s not another serious scientist in the world who thinks it’s going to be over soon. I didn’t say over soon. I say we’re learning to live with it. We have no choice. We can’t lock ourselves up in a basement like Joe does. He has the ability to lock himself up. I don’t know. He’s obviously made a lot of money someplace, but he has this thing about living in a basement. People can’t do that. By the way I as the president couldn’t do that. I’d love to put myself in the basement or in a beautiful room in the White House and go away for a year and a half until it disappears. I can’t do that. And Kirsten, every meeting I had, every meeting I had and I’d meet a lot of families, including gold star families and military families. Every meeting I had and I had to meet them, I had to. It would be horrible to have canceled everything. I said, “This is dangerous and you catch it.” And I caught it. I learned a lot. I learned a lot. Great doctors, great hospitals. And now I recovered. 99.9 of young people recover. 99% of people recover. 99% of people recover. We have to recover. We can’t close up our nation. We have to open our school and we can’t close up our nation, or you’re not going to have a nation. And, of course, the CDC has said young people can get sick with COVID-19 and can pass it. Vice President Biden, I want to talk broadly about strategy though. 30 seconds, please. Then I have a question. Number one, he says that we’re learning to live with it. People are learning to die with it. You folks home will have an empty chair at the kitchen table this morning. That man or wife going to bed tonight and reaching over to try to touch, there out of habit, where their wife or husband was, is gone. Learning to live with it. Come on. We’re dying with it, because he’s never said. See, you said, “It’s dangerous.” When’s the last time? Is it really dangerous still? Are we dangerous. You tell the people it’s dangerous now. What should they do about the danger? And you say, “I take no responsibility. Excuse me. I take full responsibility. It’s not my fault that it came here. It’s China’s fault. And you know what? It’s not Joe’s fault that it came here either. It’s China’s fault. They kept it from going into the rest of China for the most part, but they didn’t keep it from coming out to the world, including Europe and ourselves. Vice President Biden. The fact is that when we knew it was coming, when it hit, what happened? What did the President say? He said, “Don’t worry. It’s going to go away. It’ll be gone by Easter. Don’t worry. Warm weather. Don’t worry. Maybe inject bleach.” He said he was kidding when he said that, but a lot of people thought it was serious. A whole range of things the President has said, even today, he thinks we are in control. We’re about to lose 200,000 more people. President Trump. Look, perhaps just to finish this, I was kidding on that, but just to finish this, when I closed he said I shouldn’t have closed. And that went on for months. Nancy Pelosi said the same thing. She was dancing on the streets in Chinatown, in San Francisco. But when I closed, he said, “This is a terrible thing, you xenophobic.” I think he called me racist even, because I was closing it to China. Now he says I should have closed it earlier. Joe, it doesn’t. I didn’t say either of those things. You certainly did. You certainly did. I talked about his xenophobia in a different context. It wasn’t about closing the border to Chinese coming to the United States. All right, I want to talk about both of your different strategies to handling this. He thought I shouldn’t have closed the border, that’s obvious. No. Okay. Let’s talk about your different strategies toward dealing with this. Mr. Vice President you suggested you would support new shutdowns if scientists recommended it. What I would say is, I’m going to shut down the virus, not the country. It’s his ineptitude that caused the country to have to shut down in large part, why businesses have gone under, why schools are closed, why so many people have lost their living, and why they’re concerned. Those other concerns are real. That’s why he should have been, instead of in a sand trap at his golf course, he should have been negotiating with Nancy Pelosi and the rest of the Democrats and Republicans about what to do about the acts they were passing for billions of dollars to make sure people had the capacity. Oh, well, no. I’m not shutting down today, but there are … Look, you need standards. The standard is, if you have a reproduction rate in a community that’s above a certain level, everybody says, “Slow up. More social distancing. Do not open bars and do not open gymnasiums. Do not open until you get this under control, under more control.” But when you do open, give the people the capacity to be able to open and have the capacity to do it safely. For example, schools. Schools, they need a lot of money to be open. They need to deal with ventilation systems. They need to deal with smaller classes, more teachers, more pods, and he’s refused to support that money, or at least up to now. I think we have to respond, if I might. Please. And then I have a follow-up. Thank you, and I appreciate that. Look, all he does is talk about shut downs. But forget about him. His Democrat Governors, Cuomo in New York, you look at what’s going on in California, you look at Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Democrats, Democrats all, they’re shut down so tight and they’re dying. They’re dying. And he supports all these people. All he talks about is shut downs. No, we’re not going to shut down. And we have to open our schools. And it’s like, as an example, I have a young son, he also tested positive. By the time I spoke to the doctor the second time, he was fine. It just went away. Young people, I guess, it’s their immune system. Let me follow up with you, President Trump. You’ve demanded schools open in person and insist they can do it safely. But just yesterday, Boston became the latest city to move its public school system entirely online after a coronavirus spike. I want to open the schools. The transmittal rate to the teachers is very small. But I want to open the schools. We have to open our country. We’re not going to have a country. You can’t do this. We can’t keep this country closed. This is a massive country with a massive economy. People are losing their jobs. They’re committing suicide. There’s depression, alcohol, drugs at a level that nobody’s ever seen before. There’s abuse, tremendous abuse. We have to open our country. I’ve said it often, the cure cannot be worse than the problem itself, and that’s what’s happening. And he wants to close down. He’ll close down the country if one person in our massive bureaucracy says we should close it down. Vice President Biden, your response. Simply not true. We ought to be able to walk and chew gum at the same time. We ought to be able to safely open, but they need resources to open? You need to be able to, for example, if you’re going to open a business, have social distancing within the business. You need to have, if you have a restaurant, you need to have plexiglass dividers so people cannot infect one another. You need to be in a position where you can take testing rapidly and know whether the person is in fact infected. You need to be able to trace. You need to be able to provide all the resources that are needed to do this. And that is not inconsistent with saying that we’re going to make sure that we’re going to open safely. And by the way, all you teachers out there, not that many of you are going to die, so don’t worry about it. So don’t worry about it. Come on. President Trump, let me follow up with you quickly. By the way, I will say this, If you go and look at what’s happened to New York, it’s a ghost town. It’s a ghost town. And when you talk about plexiglass, these are restaurants that had dying. These are businesses with no money. Putting up plexiglass is unbelievably expensive, and it’s not the answer. I mean, you’re going to sit there in a cubicle wrapped around with plastic. These are businesses that are dying, Joe. You can’t do that to people. You just can’t. Take a look at New York and what’s happened to my wonderful city. For so many years, I loved it. It was vibrant. It’s dying. Everyone’s leaving New York. Vice President Biden. Take a look at what New York has done in terms of turning the curve down, in terms of the number of people dying. And I don’t look at this in terms of the way he does, blue states and red states. They’re all the United States. And look at the states that are having such a spike in the coronavirus. They’re the red states, they’re the states in the Midwest, they’re the states in the upper Midwest. That’s where the spike is occurring significantly. But they’re all Americans. They’re all Americans. And what we have to do is say, wear these masks, number one. Make sure we get the help that the businesses need. That money’s already been passed to do that. It’s been out there since the beginning of the summer, and nothing’s happened. Kristen, New York has lost more than 40,000 people, 11,000 people in nursing homes. When you say spike, take a look at what’s happening in Pennsylvania where they’ve had it closed. Take a look at what’s happening with your friend in Michigan, where her husband’s the only one allowed to do anything. It’s been like a prison. Now, it was just ruled unconstitutional. Take a look at North Carolina, they’re having spikes and they’ve been closed, and they’re getting killed financially. We can’t let that happen, Joe. You can’t let that happen. We have to open up. And we understand the disease. We have to protect our seniors. We have to protect our elderly. We have to protect especially our seniors with heart problems and diabetes problems. And we will protect. We have the best testing in the world by far. That’s why we have so many cases. Let me follow up with you before we move on to our next section. President Trump, this week, you called Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s best known infectious disease expert “a disaster.” You described him and other medical experts as “idiots. I’m listening to all of them, including Anthony. I get along very well with Anthony. … think to all of them, including Anthony. I get along very well with Anthony, but he did say, “Don’t wear masks.” He did say, as you know, “This is not going to be a problem.” I think he’s a Democrat, but that’s okay. He said, “This is not going to be a problem. We are not going to have a problem at all.” When Joe says that I said, Anthony Fauci said, and others, and many others. And I’m not knocking him, nobody knew. Look, nobody knew what this thing was. Nobody knew where it was coming from, what it was. We’ve learned a lot. But Anthony said “Don’t wear masks,” now he wants to wear masks. Anthony also said, if you look back, exact words, here’s his exact words. “This is no problem. This is going to go away soon.” So he’s allowed to make mistakes. He happens to be a good person. Vice President Biden, your response quickly, and then we’re going to move on to the next section. My response is that think about what the President knew in January and didn’t tell the American people. He was told this was a serious virus that spread in the air, and it was much worse, much worse, than the flu. He went on record and said to one of your colleagues, recorded, that in fact he knew how dangerous it was but he didn’t want to tell us. He didn’t want to tell us because he didn’t want us to panic. He didn’t want us… Americans don’t panic. He panicked. But guess what, in the meantime, we find out in the New York Times the other day, that in fact his folks went to Wall Street and said, “This is a really dangerous thing.” And a memo out of that meeting — not from his administration, but from some of the brokers — said, “Sell short, because we’ve got to get moving. It’s a dangerous problem. I’m going to give you 30 seconds to respond and then we’re going to move on. [crosstalk 00:28:34] I don’t know. Somebody went through Wall Street. You’re the one that takes all the money from Wall Street. I don’t take it. Joe, you have raised a lot of money, tremendous amounts of money. And every time you raise money deals are made, Joe. I could raise so much more money. As President, and as somebody that knows most of those people, I could call the heads of Wall Street, the heads of every company in America. I would blow away every record. But I don’t want to do that because it puts me in a bad position. And then you bring up Wall Street? You shouldn’t be bringing up Wall Street, because you’re the one that takes the money from Wall Street, not me. I could blow away your records like you wouldn’t believe. We don’t need money. We have plenty of money. All right, gentlemen, we’re going to move on. Don’t tell me about [crosstalk 00:29:17]. Average contribution, $43. All right. We’re going to move on to our next section, which is national security. And I do want to start with the security of our elections and some breaking news from overnight. Just last night, top intelligence officials confirmed again that both Russia and Iran are working to influence this election. Both countries have obtained US voter registration information, these officials say, and Iran sent intimidating messages to Florida voters. This question goes to you, Mr. Vice President. What would you do to put an end to this threat? You have two minutes, uninterrupted. I made it clear and I asked everyone else to take the pledge. I made it clear that any country, no matter who it is, that interferes in American elections will pay a price. They will pay a price. And it’s been overwhelmingly clear this election — I won’t even get into the last one — this election, that Russia has been involved, China’s been involved to some degree, and now we learn that Iran is involved. They will pay a price if I’m elected. They’re interfering with American sovereignty. That’s what’s going on right now. They’re interfering with American sovereignty. And to the best of my knowledge, I don’t think the President has said anything to Putin about it. I don’t think he’s talking to them a lot. I don’t think he’s said a word. I don’t know why he hasn’t said a word to Putin about it, and I don’t know what he has recently said, if anything, to the Iranians. My guess is he’d probably be more outspoken with regard to the Iranians. But the point is this, folks. We are in a situation where we have foreign countries trying to interfere in the outcome of our election. His own National Security Advisor told him that what is happening with his buddy… Well, I shouldn’t… Well, I will. His buddy Rudy Giuliani. He’s being used as a Russian pawn. He’s being fed information that is Russian that is not true. And then what happens? Nothing happens. And then you find out that everything that’s going on here, about Russia is wanting to make sure that I do not get elected the next President of the United States, because they know I know them, and they know me. I don’t understand why this President is unwilling to take on Putin when he’s actually paying bounties to kill American soldiers in Afghanistan, when he’s engaged in activities that are trying to destabilize all of NATO. I don’t know why he doesn’t do it, but it’s worth asking the question. Why isn’t that being done? Any country that interferes with us will, in fact, pay a price, because they’re affecting our sovereignty. President Trump, same question to you. [crosstalk 00:31:48] Let me ask the question. You’re going to have two minutes to respond. For two elections in a row now, there has been substantial interference from foreign adversaries. What would you do in your next term to put an end to this? Two minutes, uninterrupted. Well, let me respond to the first part, as Joe answered. Joe got $3.5 million from Russia and it came through Putin, because he was very friendly with the former mayor of Moscow and it was the mayor of Moscow’s wife. And you got $3.5 million. Your family got $3.5 million. And someday you’re going to have to explain, why did you get three and a half? I never got any money from Russia. I don’t get money from Russia. Now, about your thing last night. I knew all about that. And through John — who is John Ratcliffe, who is fantastic, DNI — he said the one thing that’s common to both of them. They both want you to lose because there has been nobody tougher to Russia between the sanctions, nobody tougher than me on Russia, between the sanctions, between all of what I’ve done with NATO. I’ve got the NATO countries to put up an extra $130 billion going to $420 billion a year. That’s to guard against Russia. I sold, while he was selling pillows and sheets, I sold tank busters to Ukraine. There has been nobody tougher on Russia than Donald Trump. And I’ll tell you, they were so bad. They took over the submarine port, you remember that very well, during your term, during you and Barack Obama. They took over a big part of what should have been Ukraine. You handed it to them. But you were getting a lot of money from Russia. They were paying you a lot of money, and they probably still are. But now, with what came out today, it’s even worse. All of the emails, the emails, the horrible emails of the kind of money that you were raking in, you and your family. And Joe, you were vice-president when some of this was happening, and it should have never happened. And I think you owe an explanation to the American people. Why is it, somebody just had a news conference a little while ago who was essentially supposed to work with you and your family, but what he said was damning. And regardless of me, I think you have to clean it up and talk to the American people. Maybe you can do it right now. [crosstalk 00:01:31]. … and then I do want to follow up on the election security. I have not taken a penny from any foreign source ever in my life. We learned that this president paid 50 times the tax in China as a secret bank account with China, does business in China, and in fact, is talking about me taking money? I have not taken a single penny from any country, whatsoever, ever, number one. Number two, this is a president… I have released all of my tax returns, 22 years, go look at them, 22 years of my tax return. You have not released a single solitary year of your tax return. What are you hiding? Why are you unwilling? The foreign countries are paying you a lot. Russia’s paying you a lot. China’s paying you a lot on your hotels and all your businesses all around the country, all around the world. And China’s building a new road to a new golf course you have overseas. So, what’s going on here? Release your tax return or stop talking about corruption. President Trump, your response. First of all, I called my accountants, underwrote it, I’m going to release them as soon as we can. I want to do it. And it’ll show how successful, how great this company is. But much more importantly than that, people were saying $750. I asked them a week ago, I said, “What did I pay?” They said, “Sir, you prepaid tens of millions of dollars.” I prepaid my tax, over the last number of years, tens of millions of dollars, I prepaid, because at some point, they think it’s an estimate. They think I may have to pay tax. So I already prepaid it. Nobody told me that. Nobody told you that. Excuse me. And it wasn’t written. Whenever they write this, they keep talking about $750, which I think is a filing fee, but let me just tell you, I prepaid millions and millions of dollars in taxes, number one. Number two, I don’t make money from China. You do. I don’t make money from Ukraine. You do. I don’t make money from Russia. You made $3.5 million, Joe, and your son gave you, they even have a statement that we have to give 10% to the big man. You’re the big man, I think. I don’t know, maybe you’re not, but you’re the big man, I think. Your son said we have to give 10% to the big men. Joe, what’s that all about? It’s terrible. All right, gentlemen. I have to respond to that. I’m going to let you both respond very quickly. As soon as the auditors finish. [crosstalk 00:04:06]. … deep down in the IRS, they treat me horribly. We made a deal, it was all settled until I decide to run for president. I get treated very badly by the IRS, very unfairly, but we had a deal all done. As soon as we’re completed with the deal, I want to release it, but I have paid millions and millions of dollars and it’s worse than paying. I paid in advance. It’s called prepaying your taxes. I paid [crosstalk 00:04:32]. Okay. I want to ask you both about questions regarding your potential foreign entanglements and questions that have been raised to give you both a chance to talk about this more broadly. Respond very quickly, and then I’ll get to my question. Why did he… he’s been saying this for four years, show us, just show us, stop playing around. You’ve been saying for four years you’re going to release your taxes. Everybody knows. Nobody knows, Mr. President. What they do know is you’re not paying your taxes, or you’re paying taxes that are so low, when last time he said, what he paid, he said, I only pay that little because I’m smart. I know how to game the system. Come on. Come on, folks. [crosstalk 00:05:11] President Trump, and then I want to get to two questions to both of you on this. Sure. I was put through a phony witch hunt for three years. It started before I even got elected. They spied of my campaign. No president should ever have to go through what I went through. Let me just say this, Mueller and 18 angry Democrats and FBI agents all over the place spent $48 million. They went through everything I had, including my tax returns, and they found absolutely no collusion and nothing wrong. $48 million. All right. … millions of dollars. Your other brother made a fortune, and it’s all through you, Joe. And they say you get some of it. And you do live very well, you have houses all over the place. You live very well. All right, gentlemen. Let me just ask some questions about all of this broadly. Nothing was unethical. Here’s what the deal. With regard to Ukraine. We had this whole question about whether or not, because he was on the board, I later learned of Burisma, a company that somehow, I had done something wrong, yet every single solitary person, when he was going through his impeachment, testifying under oath, who work for him, said I did my job impeccably. I carried out U.S. policy, not one single solitary thing was out of line, not a single thing, number one. Number two, the guy who got in trouble in Ukraine was this guy trying to bribe the Ukrainian government to say something negative about me, which they would not do and did not do because it never ever, ever happened. My son has not made money in terms of this thing about, what are you talking about, China. I have not had… the only guy who made money from China is this guy. He’s the only one. Nobody else has made money from China. Very quickly. His son didn’t have a job for a long time, was, sadly, no longer in the military service, I won’t get into that, and he didn’t have a job. As soon as he became vice-president, Burisma, not the best reputation in the world, I hear they paid him $183,000 a month, listen to this, $183,000, and they gave him a $3 million upfront payment, and he had no energy experience. That’s 100% dishonest. All right. I’m going to let the vice-president respond to that quickly, and then I need to get to a question to you. Very quickly, Mr. Vice-President. No basis for that. Everybody investigated that. No one said anything he did was wrong in Ukraine. Okay. President Trump, this is for you. Since you took office, you’ve never divested from your business. You’ve personally promoted your properties abroad. A report this week, which was referenced, does indicate that your company has a bank account in China. I have many bank accounts and they’re all listed and they’re all over the place. I mean, I was a businessman doing business. The bank account you’re referring to, which is, everybody knows about it, it’s listed, the bank account was in 2013. That’s what it was. It was opened. It was closed in 2015, I believe. And then I decided, because I was going to do… I was thinking about doing a deal in China, like millions of other people, I was thinking about it and I decided I’m not going to do it, didn’t like it, I decided not to do it, had an account open and I closed it. Okay. Excuse me. And then, unlike him where he’s vice-president and he does business, I then decided to run for president after that. That was before. So I closed it before I even ran for president, let alone became president, big difference. He is the vice-president of the United States and his son, his brother, and his other brother are getting rich. They’re like a vacuum cleaner. They’re sucking up money [crosstalk 00:09:20]. Okay. President Trump, thank you. We do need to move on. Not true. I do want to ask you, Vice-President Biden, about China. Let’s talk about China more broadly. There have, of course, President Trump has said that they should pay for not being fully transparent in regards to the coronavirus. What I’d make China do is play by the international rules, not like he has done. He has caused the deficit of the China to go up, not down, with China, up, not down. We are making sure that in order to do business in China, you have to give all your intellectual property. You have to have a partner in China. It’s 51%, we would not do that at all, number one. Number two, we’re in a situation where China would have to play by the rules internationally as well. When I met with Xi and when I was still vice-president, he said we’re setting up air identification zones in the South China Sea. You can’t fly through them. I said we’re going to fly through them. We just flew B-52, B-1 bombers through it. We’re not going to pay attention. They have to play by the rules. And what’s he do? He embraces guys like the thugs, like in North Korea and the Chinese president and Putin and others, and he pokes his finger [inaudible 00:10:36] all of our friends, all of our allies. We make up only… we’re 25%, 25% of the world’s economy. We need to be having the rest of our friends with us saying to China, “These are the rules. You play by them, or you’re going to pay the price for not paying by them economically. That’s the way I will run it, and that’s what we did and upholding steel tariffs and a range of other things when we were president and vice-president. All right. Let’s talk about North Korea. No, no, no. Excuse me. … and Vice President. Excuse me. No, I have to respond to that. Okay. Very quickly, and then we’re going to move on to North Korea. Not true. … after spending 10 minutes in office and being in Air Force Two. Number one. Number two, there’s a very strong email talking about your family wanting to make $10 million a year for introductions. That’s not true. No, but wait a minute. What are you going to do, what specifically are you going to do to make China pay? You’ve said you’re going to make them pay. First of all, China is paying. They’re paying billions and billions of dollars. I just gave $28 billion. I just gave $28 billion to our farmers. Tax payer’s money. Taxpayer’s money. Didn’t come from China. No, no. You know who the taxpayer is? It’s called China. Not true. China pays 28 billion, and you know what they did to pay it, Joe? They devalued their currency and they also paid up, and you know got the money? Our farmers, our great farmers, because they were targeted. You never charged them anything. Also, I charged them 25% on dumped steel, because they were killing our steel industry. We were not going to have a steel industry. Okay. And now we have a steel industry. Okay. Vice President Biden, your response, please. My response is, look, there’s a reason why he’s bringing up all this malarkey. There’s a reason for it. He doesn’t want to talk about the substantive issues. It’s not about his family and my family. It’s about your family, and your family’s hurting badly. If you’re a middle-class family, you’re getting hurt badly right now. You’re sitting at the kitchen table this morning deciding, “Well, we can’t get new tires. They’re bald, because we have to wait another month or so.” Or, “Are we going to be able to pay the mortgage?” Or, “Who’s going to tell her she can’t go back to community college?” They’re the decisions you’re making, and the middle-class families like I grew up in Scranton and Claymont, they’re in trouble. We should be talking about your families, but that’s the last thing he wants to talk about. That is a typical statement. I want to talk about North Korea. Excuse me. Just for one second, please. 10 seconds, Mr. President. 10 seconds. That’s a typical political statement. Let’s get off this China thing, and then he looks, “The family around the table, everything.” Just a typical politician when I see that. I’m not a typical politician. Let’s talk about North Korea now. That’s why I got elected. Let’s get off the subject of China. Let’s talk about sitting around the table. Come on, Joe. You could do better. We’re going to talk about North Korea now. President Trump, you’ve met with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un three times. You’ve talked about your beautiful letters with him. You’ve touted the fact that there hasn’t been a war or a long range missile test, and yet North Korea recently rolled out its biggest ever intercontinental ballistic missile and continues to develop its nuclear arsenal. Do you see that as a betrayal of the relationship you forged. No. Just 30 seconds here because we need to get onto the next topic. So when I met with Barack Obama, we sat in the White House, right at the beginning, had a great conversation. Was supposed to be 15 minutes and it was well over an hour. He said, “The biggest problem we have is North Korea.” He indicated we will be in a war with North Korea. Guess what? It would be a nuclear war. And he does have plenty of nuclear capability. In the meantime, I have a very good relationship with him. Different kind of a guy, but he probably thinks the same thing about me. We have a different kind of a relationship. We have a very good relationship and there’s no war. And about two months ago, he broke into a certain area. They said, “Oh, there’s going to be trouble.” I said, “No, they’re not, because he’s not going to do that.” And I was right. Look, instead of being in a war where millions of people, Seoul is 25 miles away, millions and millions, 32 million people. Millions of people would be dead right now. We don’t have a war and I have a good relationship. President Trump, that’s 30 seconds. Vice President Biden to you. North Korea conducted four nuclear tests under the Obama administration. Because I’d make it clear, which we were making clear to China, they had to be part of the deal, because I made it clear as a spokesperson for the illustration when I went to China that I said, “Why are you moving your missile defense up so close? Why are you moving more forces here? Why are you continue to do military maneuvers with South Korea?” I said, “Because North Korea is a problem, and we’re going to continue to do it so we can control them. We’re going to make sure we can control them and make sure they can not hurt us. And so if you want to do something about it, step up and help. If not, it’s going to continue.” What has he done? He’s legitimized North Korea. He’s talked about his good buddy, who’s a thug, a thug. And he talks about how we’re better off. And they have much more capable missiles, able to reach us territory much more easily than they ever did before. Let me follow up with you, Vice President Biden. You’ve said you wouldn’t meet with Kim Jong-un without preconditions. On the condition that he would agree that he would be drawing down his nuclear capacity. The Korean Peninsula should be a nuclear free zone. All right. Let’s move on to American families. Kristen. Very quickly, 10 seconds, President Trump. They tried to meet with him. He wouldn’t do it. He didn’t like Obama. He didn’t like him. He wouldn’t do it. Okay, I’ve got to give him a chance to respond to that before we move on. I know for a fact. They tried. We wouldn’t do it. And that’s okay. You know what? North Korea, we’re not in a war. We have a good relationship. People don’t understand. Having a good relationship with leaders of other countries is a good thing. President Trump, we have to move on, because we have a lot of questions to get to. Your response. We had a good relationship with Hitler before he, in fact, invaded Europe, the rest of Europe. Come on. The reason he would not meet with President Obama is because President Obama said, “We’re going to talk about denuclearization. We’re not going to legitimize you and we’re going to continue to push stronger and stronger sanctions on you.” That’s why he wouldn’t meet with us. All right, let’s move on. And it didn’t happen. Let’s move on and talk about American families. Excuse me. He left me a mess. Kristen. President Trump. They left me a mess. North Korea was a mess, and in fact, if you remember the first two or three months. It was a very dangerous period in my first three months before we worked things out a little bit. Okay. There was a very day. They left us a mess, and Obama would be, I think, the first to say it, was the single biggest problem he thought that our country [crosstalk 00:17:03]. Okay, let’s move on to American families and the economy. One of the issues that’s most important to them is healthcare, as you both know. Today, there was a key vote on a new Supreme Court Justice, Amy Coney Barrett, and healthcare is at the center of her confirmation fight. Over 20 million Americans get their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. It’s headed to the Supreme Court and your administration, Mr. President, is advocating for the court to overturn it. If the Supreme Court does overturn that law, there’s 20 million Americans could lose their health insurance almost overnight. So what would you do if those people have their health insurance taken away? You have two minutes uninterrupted. First of all, I’ve already done something that nobody thought was possible. Through the legislature, I terminated the individual mandate. That is the worst part of Obamacare, as we call it. The individual mandate where you have to pay a fortune for the privilege of not having to pay for bad health insurance, I terminated. It’s gone. Now, it’s in court, because Obamacare is no good. But then I made a decision, run it as well as you can, to my people, great people, run it as well as you can. I could have gone the other route and made everybody very unhappy. They ran it. Premiums are down. Everything’s down. Here’s the problem. No matter how well you run it, it’s no good. What we’d like to do is terminate it. We have the individual mandate done. I don’t know that it’s going to work. If we don’t win, we will have to run it and we’ll have Obamacare, but it’ll be better run. But it no longer is Obamacare, because without the individual mandate, it’s much different. Pre-existing conditions will always stay. What I would like to do is a much better healthcare, much better. We’ll always protect people with pre-existing. So I’d like to terminate Obamacare, come up with a brand new, beautiful healthcare. The Democrats will do it, because there’ll be tremendous pressure on them. And we might even have the House by that time. And I think we’re going to win the House. You’ll see, but I think we’re going to win the House. But come up with a better healthcare, always protecting people with pre-existing conditions. And one thing very important, we have 180 million people out there that have great private healthcare. Far more than we’re talking about with Obamacare. Joe Biden is going to terminate all of those policies. These are people that love their healthcare. People that have been successful, middle-income people, been successful. They have 180 million plans, 180 million people, families. Under what he wants to do, which will basically be socialized medicine, he won’t even have a choice, they want to terminate 180 million plans. We have done an incredible job at healthcare, and we’re going to do even better. Just you watch. Okay. Vice President Biden, yes, this is for you. Your healthcare plan calls for building on Obamacare. So my question is, what is your plan if the law is ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court? You have two minutes uninterrupted. What I’m going to do is pass Obamacare with a public option, and become Bidencare. The public option is an option that says that if you in fact do not have the wherewithal, if you qualify for Medicaid and you do not have the wherewithal in your state to get Medicaid, you automatically are enrolled, providing competition for insurance companies. That’s what’s going to happen. Secondly, we’re going to make sure we reduce the premiums and reduce drug prices by making sure that there’s competition, that doesn’t exist now, by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices with the insurance companies. Thirdly, the idea that I want to eliminate private insurance, the reason why I had such a fight with 20 candidates for the nomination was I support private insurance. That’s why. Not one single person with private insurance would lose their insurance under my plan, nor did they under Obamacare. They did not lose their insurance unless they chose they wanted to go to something else. Lastly, we’re going to make sure we’re in a situation that we actually protect pre-existing. There’s no way he can protect pre-existing conditions. None, zero. You can’t do it in the ether. He’s been talking about this for a long time. He’s never come up with a plan. I guess we’re going to get the pre-existing condition plan the same time we got the infrastructure plan that we waited for since ’17, ’18, ’19, and 20. I still have a few more minutes. I know you’re getting anxious. The fact is that he’s already cost the American people, because of his terrible handling of the COVID virus and economic spillover. 10 million people have lost their private insurance, and he wants to take away 22 million more people who have it under Obamacare and over 110 million people with pre-existing conditions. I have a follow-up for you Vice President Biden. It relates to something that President Trump said. He’s accusing you of wanting socialized medicine. Concerns that your healthcare plan, which includes a government insurance option, takes the country one step closer to a healthcare system run entirely by the government. I say it’s ridiculous. It’s like saying that the fact that there’s a public option that people can choose, that makes it a socialist plan. Look, the difference between the president and I… I think healthcare is not a privilege, it’s a right. Everyone should have the right to have affordable healthcare, and I am very proud of my plan. It’s gotten endorsed by all the major labor unions, as well as a whole range of other people who, in fact, are concerned in the medical field. This is something that’s going to save people’s lives. And this is going to give some people an opportunity to have healthcare for their children. How many of you at home are worried and rolling around in bed tonight, wondering what in God’s name you’re going to do if you get sick, because you’ve lost your health insurance and your company’s gone under? We have to provide health insurance for people at an affordable rate, and that’s what I do. Excuse me. … your response. … for 47 years. He didn’t do it. He was now there as vice president for eight years. And it’s not like it was 25 years ago. It was three and three quarters… It was just a little while ago, right? Less than four years ago. He didn’t do anything. He didn’t do it. He wants socialized medicine. And it’s not that he wants it. His vice president, she is more liberal than Bernie Sanders and wants it even more. Bernie Sanders wants it. The Democrats want it. You’re going to have socialized medicine, just like you want it with fracking. “We’re not going to have fracking. We’re going to stop fracking. We’re going to stop fracking.” Then he goes to Pennsylvania after he gets a nomination, where he got very lucky to get it. And he goes to Pennsylvania, and he says, “Oh, we’re going to have fracking.” And you never ask that question. And by the way, so far, I respect very much the way you’re handling this, I have to say. But somebody should ask the question. You can ask it. He goes for a year, there will be no fracking. We have a number of topics we’re going to get to. No, no. But that’s a big question. It’s the same thing with socialized medicine. I have to respond to healthcare. Vice President, your response please. My response is, people deserve to have affordable healthcare, period. Period, period, period. And the Biden care proposal will in fact provide for that affordable healthcare, lower premiums. What we’re going to do is going to cost some money. It’s going to cost over $750 billion over 10 years to do it. And they’re going to have lower premiums. You can buy into the better plans, the cheaper plans, lower your premiums, deal with unexpected billing, and have your drug prices drop significantly. He keeps talking about it. He hasn’t done a thing for anybody on healthcare. Not a thing. Very quickly, then I want to talk about what’s happening on Capitol Hill. When he says public option, he’s talking about socialized medicine and healthcare. Wrong. … and destroying your Social Security. And this whole country will come down. Bernie Sanders tried it in his state. Bernie. He tried it in his state. His governor was a very liberal governor. They wanted to make it work. Okay. It was impossible to work. It doesn’t work. He’s a very confused guy. He thinks he’s running against somebody else. He’s running against Joe Biden. I beat all those other people because I disagreed with them. Joe Biden, he’s running against. And the idea that we’re in a situation that is going to destroy Medicare… This is the guy that the actuary of Medicare said, “If in fact…” That’s Social Security. “If in fact he continues his plan to withhold the tax on Social Security, Social Security will be bankrupt by 2023 with no way to make up for it.” This is the guy who’s tried to cut Medicare. The idea that Donald Trump is lecturing me on Social Security and Medicare? Come on. 10 seconds, Mr. President, and then I have to go to another question. He tried to hurt Social Security years ago. Years ago. Go back and look at the records. He tried to hurt Social Security years ago. One thing. All right. Let’s move on. I’m going to move on. Mr. President, I have to move on to the next question or else we’re not going to have time to talk about it. They say the stock market will boom if I’m elected. If he’s elected, the stock market will crash. Okay. Let’s move on to the next question. The biggest analysts are saying that. Very quickly. Look, the idea that the stock market is booming is his only measure of what’s happening. Where I come from in Scranton and Claymont, the people don’t live off of the stock market. Just in the last three years, during this crisis, the billionaires in this country made, according to Wall Street, 700 billion more dollars. 700 billion more dollars. Because that’s his only measure. Let’s talk about what’s happening on Capitol Hill. 401(k)s. Kristen, 401(k)s are through the roof. We’re going to move on. People’s stock are through the roof. All right. And he doesn’t come from Scranton. He lived there for a short period of time before he even knew it. Okay. We’re going to move on to the next question. And he left. And the people of Pennsylvania will show you that. Let me move on to my next question, gentlemen. They understand. As of tonight, more than 12 million people are out of work. And as of tonight, 8 million more Americans have fallen into poverty, and more families are going hungry every day. Those hit hardest are women and people of color. They see Washington fighting over a relief bill. Mr. President, why haven’t you been able to get them the help they need? 30 seconds here. Because Nancy Pelosi doesn’t want to approve it. I do. But you’re the president. I do. But I still have to get, unfortunately… That’s one of the reasons I think we’re going to take over the House, because of her. Nancy Pelosi doesn’t want to approve anything because she’d love to have some victories on a date called November 3rd. Nancy Pelosi does not want to approve it. We are ready, willing, and able to do something. Don’t forget, we’ve already approved three plans. And it’s gone through, including the Democrats, in all fairness. This one, she doesn’t want. It’s near the election. Because she thinks it helps her politically. I think it hurts her politically. All right, Mr. By the way, as you know, the Republican leader in the United States Senate said he can’t pass it. He will be able to pass it. He does not have Republican votes. If we made a deal, the Republicans will pass it. Let me ask Vice President Biden a question. You are the leader of the Democratic party. I have, and they have pushed it. Look, they passed this act all the way back in the beginning of the summer. It’s not new. It’s been out there. This HEROES Act has been sitting there. And look at what’s happening. When I was in charge of the recovery act with $800 billion, I was able to get $145 billion to local communities that have to balance their budgets and states that have to balance their budgets. And then they have to fire firefighters, teachers, first responders, law enforcement officers, so they could keep their cities and counties running. He will not support that. They have not done a thing for them. And Mitch McConnell said, “Let them go bankrupt. Let them go bankrupt.” Come on. The bill that was passed in the House was a bailout of badly run, high crime, Democrat, all run by Democrat cities and states. It was a way of getting a lot of money, billions and billions of dollars, to these guys. It was also a way of getting a lot of money from our people’s pockets to people that come into our country illegally. We were going to take care of everything for them. And I’d love to do that. I’d love to help them. But what that does, everybody all over the world will start pouring into our country. We can’t do it. This was a way of taking care of them. This was a way of spending on things that had nothing to do with COVID, as per your question. But it was really a big bailout for badly run Democrat cities and states. All right. By the way, if I get elected, I’m not going to… I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I’m going to be an American president. I don’t see red states and blue states. What I see is American United States. And folks, every single state out there finds themself in trouble. They’re going to start laying off, whether they’re red or blue, cops, firefighters, first responders, teachers, because they have to balance their budget. And the founders were smart. They allowed the federal government to deficit spend to compensate for the United States of America. I want to talk about the minimum wage, gentlemen. Mr. Vice President, we are talking a lot about struggling small businesses and business owners these days. Do you think this is the right time to ask them to raise the minimum wage? You of course support a $15 federal minimum wage. I do, because I think one of the things we’re going to have to do is we’re going to have to bail them out too. We should be bailing them out now, those small businesses. You got one in six of them going under. They’re not going to be able to make it back. They passed a package that allows us to be able… They call it PPP. Money is supposed to go to help them do everything from organize how they can deal with their businesses being open safely, schools, how they can make classrooms smaller, how they can hire more teachers, how they can put ventilation systems in. They need the help. The businesses, as well as the schools, need the help. These guys will not help them. It’s not giving them any of the money. Excuse me. One thing very quickly. He said we have to help our small businesses by raising the minimum wage. That’s not helping. I think it should be a state option. Alabama is different than New York. New York is different from Vermont. Every state is different. It should be a state option. It’s very important. We have to help our small businesses. How are you helping your small businesses when you’re forcing wages? What’s going to happen, and what’s been proven to happen, is when you do that, these small businesses fire many of their employees. Not true, by the way. … you would consider raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. Say it. Say it. You said recently you would consider raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. But what I really like… In a second administration. But not to a level that’s going to put all these businesses out of business. It should be a state option. … in different places. I know different places. They’re all different. Some places, $ 15 is not so bad. In other places, other states, $15 would be ruinings. Okay, President Trump, thank you. Quick response Vice President Biden. No one should work one job, be below poverty. People are making six, seven, eight bucks an hour. These first responders we all clap for as they come down the street because they’ve allowed us to make it. What’s happening? They deserve a minimum wage of $15. Anything below that puts you below the poverty level. And there is no evidence that when you raise the minimum wage, businesses go out of business. That is simply not true. We’re going to talk about immigration. We’re going to talk about immigration now, gentlemen. And we’re going to talk about families within this context. Mr. President, your administration separated children from their parents at the border, at least 4,000 kids. You’ve since reversed your zero tolerance policy, but the United States can’t locate the parents of more than 500 children. [inaudible 00:33:00] and lots of bad people, cartels, and they’re brought here and they used to use them to get into our country. We now have as strong a border as we’ve ever had. We’re over 400 miles of brand new wall. You see the numbers. But how will you reunite these kids with their families, Mr. But let me just tell you. Let me just tell you. They built cages. They used to say I built the cages, and then they had a picture in a certain newspaper, and it was the picture of these horrible cages and they said, “Look at these cages. President Trump built them.” And then it was determined they were built in 2014. That was him. They built cages. Yes. We’re working on it very… We’re trying very hard. But a lot of these kids come out without the parents. They come over through cartels and through coyotes and through gangs. Vice President Biden, let me bring you into this conversation. Quick response, and then another question to you. These 500-plus kids came with parents. They separated them at the border to make it a disincentive to come to begin with. “Be real tough. We’re really strong.” And guess what? They cannot… Coyotes didn’t bring them over. Their parents were with them. They got separated from their parents. And it makes us a laughingstock and violates every notion of who we are as a nation. Let me ask you a followup question. Kristen, they did it. We changed the policy. They did it. We changed. They built the cages. Let’s talk about what we’re talking about. Let’s talk about what we’re talking about. What happened? Parents were ripped… Their kids were ripped from their arms and separated, and now they cannot find over 500 of the sets of those parents, and those kids are alone. Nowhere to go. Nowhere to go. It’s criminal. It’s criminal. Let me ask you about [crosstalk 00:34:50] in 10 seconds and then I need to ask [crosstalk 00:34:53]. Kristen, I will say this. They went down. We brought reporters, everything. They are so well taken care of. They’re in facilities that were so clean. But some of them haven’t been reunited with their families. They have gotten such good… But just ask one question. Who built the cages? I’d love you to ask him that. Let me ask about your immigration policy, Mr. Vice President. The Obama Administration did fail to deliver immigration reform, which had been a key promise during the administration. It also presided over record deportations, as well as, family detentions at the border before changing course. Because we made a mistake made. It took too long to get it right. Took too long to get it right. I’ll be President of the United States, not Vice President of the United States. And the fact is I’ve made it very clear. Within a 100 days, I’m going to send to the United States Congress a pathway to citizenship for over 11 million undocumented people. And all of those so-called dreamers, those DACA kids, they’re going to be immediately certified again to be able to stay in this country and put on a path to citizenship. The idea that they are being sent home by this guy and they want to do that is they’ve gone to they’ve never seen before. I can imagine. You’re five years old. Your parents are taking across the Rio Grande River and it’s illegal. And you say, “Oh, no, Mom. Leave me here. I’m not going to go with you.” They been here. Many of them are model citizens. Over 20,000 of them are first responders out there taking care of people during this crisis. We owe them. We owe them. President Trump, your reaction. Kristen, he had eight years to do what he said he was going to do. And I’ve changed. Without having a specific, we got rid of catch and release. We got rid of a lot of horrible things that they put in and that they lived with. But he had eight years he was Vice President. He did nothing except build cages to keep children in. Vice President Biden, your response. The catch and release, you know what he’s talking about there? If in fact you had a family came across and they were arrested, they in fact were given a date to show up for their hearing. They were released. And guess what? They showed up for a hearing. And this is the first President in the history of the United States of America that anybody seeking asylum has to do it in another country. That’s never happened before in America. That’s never happened before in America. You come to the United States and you make your case that, “I seek asylum based on the following premise, why I deserve it under American law.” They’re sitting in squalor on the other side of the river. President Trump, your response. 30 seconds. And then we’ll move on. So important. It just shows that he has no understanding of immigration, of the laws. Catch and release is a disaster. A murderer would come in. A rapist would come in. A very bad person would come in. We would take their name. We have to release them into our country. And then you say they come back. Less than 1% of the people come back. We have to send ICE out and Border Patrol out to find them. We would say, “Come back in two years, three years. We’re going to give you a court case. You did Perry Mason. We’re going to give you a court case.” When you say they come back, they don’t come back, Joe. They never come back. Only the really… I hate to say this, but those with the lowest IQ, they might come back, but there are very, very few. Okay, President Trump. Let’s give Vice President Biden a chance to respond, and then we’re going to move on to the next section. You don’t know the law, Joe. Vice President Biden, your response. Know the law, what he’s telling you is simply not true. Check it out. Well, check it out. They don’t come back. Check it out. All right. Let’s move on to the next section. But we don’t have to worry about it, because they terminated it. So we don’t have to worry about it anymore, Joe. Let’s move on to the next section. That’s right. And you 525 kids not knowing where in God’s name they’re going to be and lost their parents. Go ahead. All right. Let’s talk about our next section, which is race in America. And I want to talk about the way Black and Brown Americans experience race in this country. Part of that experience is something called the talk. It happens regardless of class and income, parents who feel they have no choice, but to prepare their children for the chance that they could be targeted, including by the police, for no reason other than the color of their skin. Mr. Vice President, in the next two minutes, I want you to speak directly to these families. I do. I do. My daughter is a social worker and she’s written a lot about this. She has her graduate degree from the University of Pennsylvania in social work. And one of the reasons why I ended up working on the East Side of Wilmington, Delaware, which is 90% African-American, was to learn more about what was going on. I never had to tell my daughter if she’s pulled over, make sure she puts… For a traffic stop. “Put both hands on top of the wheel and don’t reach for the glove box because someone may shoot you.” But a Black parent, no matter how wealthy or how poor they are, has to teach their child, “When you’re walking down the street, don’t have a hoodie on when you go across the street. Making sure that you, in fact, if you get pulled over just, yes, sir, no, sir. Hands on top of the wheel. Because you are in fact, the victim, whether you’re a person making 300,000 … child of a $300,000 a year person or someone who’s on food stamps. The fact of the matter is, there is institutional racism in America. And we have always said, we’ve never lived up to it, that we hold these truths to be self-evident, all men and women are created equal. Well, guess what, we have never, ever lived up to it. But we’ve always constantly been moving the needle further and further to inclusion, not exclusion. This is the first president to come along and says, that’s the end of that. We’re not going to do that anymore. We have to provide for economic opportunity, better education, better healthcare, better access to schooling, better access to opportunity to borrow money to start businesses, all the things we can do. And I’ve laid out a clear plan as to how to do those things just to give people a shot. It’s about accumulating the ability to have wealth as well as it is to be free from violence. President Trump, same question to you, and let me remind you of the question. Yes, I do. And again, he’s been in government 47 years, he never did a thing, except in 1994, when he did such harm to the black community, and they were called … and he called them superpredators. And he said that, he said it, superpredators. And they never lived that down. 1994, your crime bill, the superpredators. Nobody has done more for the black community than Donald Trump. And if you look, with the exception of Abraham Lincoln, possible exception, but the exception of Abraham Lincoln, nobody has done what I’ve done. Criminal justice reform, Obama and Joe didn’t do it. I don’t even think they tried because they had no chance at doing it. They might’ve wanted to do it. But if you had to see the arms I had to twist to get that done, it was not a pretty picture. And everybody knows it, including some very liberal people that cried in my office. They cried in the Oval Office. Two weeks later, they’re out saying, “Gee, we have to defeat him.” Criminal justice reform, prison reform, Opportunity Zones with Tim Scott, a great Senator from South Carolina. He came in with this incredible idea for Opportunity Zones. It’s one of the most successful programs. People don’t talk about it. Tremendous investment is being made, biggest beneficiary, the black and Hispanic communities. And then Historically Black Colleges and Universities, after three years of coming to the office, I love some of those guys, they were great. They came into the office and I said, “What are you doing?” After three years, I said, “Why do you keep coming back?” Because we have no funding.” I said, “You don’t have to come back every year.” “We have to come back. Because President Obama would never give them long-term funding and I did. 10 year long-term funding and I gave them more money than they asked for because I said, “I think you need more.” And I said, “The only bad part about this is I may never see you again.” Because I got very friendly with them and they like me and I like them. But I saved Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Okay, and we’re going to talk about both of your records, but your response to that Vice President. My response to that is I never ever said what he accused me of saying. The fact of the matter is in 2000 though, after the crime bill had been in the law for awhile, this is a guy who said, “The problem with the crime bill, there’s not enough people in jail. There’s not enough people in jail.” And go on my website, get the quote, the date when he said it, “not enough people.” He talked about marauding gangs, young gangs, and the people who are going to maraud our cities. This is a guy who in the Central Park Five, five innocent black kids, he continued to push for making sure that they got the death penalty. None of them were guilty of the crimes they were suggested. Look and granted, he did in fact, let 20 people … he commuted 20 people’s sentences. We commuted over 1,000 people’s sentences, over 1,000. The very law he’s talking about is a law that in fact, initiated by Barack Obama. And secondly, we’re in a situation here where the federal prison system was reduced by 38,000 people under our administration. And one of those things we should be doing, there should be no, no minimum mandatories in the law. That’s why I’m offering $20 billion to states to change their state laws to eliminate minimum mandatories and set up drug courts. No one should be going to jail because they have a drug problem. They should be going to rehabilitation, not to jail. We should fundamentally change the system and that’s what I’m going to do. But why didn’t he do it four years ago? Why didn’t you do that four years ago? Even less than that. Why didn’t you when you vice president? You keep talking about all these things you’re going to do, and you’re going to do this, but you were there just a short time ago and you guys did nothing. You know Joe, I ran because of you. I ran because of Barack Obama, because you did a poor job. If I thought you did a good job, I would’ve never run. I would’ve never run. I ran because of you. I’m looking at you now, you’re a politician, I ran because of you. All right, Vice President Biden, your response to that. And then I do have some questions for both of you. Well, I’ll tell you what I hope he does look at me because what’s happening here is, you know who I am. You know who he is, you know his character, you know my character, you know our reputations for honor and telling the truth. I am anxious to have this race. I’m anxious to see this take place. I am … The character of the country is on the ballot. Our character’s on the ballot, look at us closely. Please respond and then we’re going to have follow up questions. If this stuff is true about Russia, Ukraine, China, other countries, Iraq. If this is true, then he’s a corrupt politician. So don’t give me the stuff about how you’re this innocent baby. They’re calling it the laptop from hell. President Trump, I want to stay on the issue of race. Excuse me, [crosstalk 00:06:13] the laptop from hell. Nobody. President Trump, we’re talking about race right now. And I do want to stay on the issue of race. I have to respond to that. Please, very quickly. There are 50 former national intelligence folks who said that what he’s accusing me of is a Russian plant. They have said that this has all the … five former heads of the CIA, both parties, say what he’s saying is a bunch of garbage. Nobody believes it except him and his good friend, Rudy Giuliani. That’s exactly what was told. This is where he’s going. Gentlemen, I want to stay on the issue of race. You have to be kidding, here we go again with the Russia. Boy, oh, boy. We’re going to continue on the issue of race. Can’t believe that one. Mr. President you’ve described the Black Lives Matter movement as a symbol of hate. You’ve shared a video of a man chanting white power to millions of your supporters. You’ve said that black professional athletes exercising their First Amendment rights should be fired. Well, you have to understand the first time I ever heard of Black Lives Matter, they were chanting, “Pigs in a blanket,” talking about police, pigs, pigs, talking about our police. “Pigs in a blanket, fry them like bacon.” I said, “That’s a horrible thing.” And they were marching down the street. And that was my first glimpse of Black Lives Matter, I thought it was a terrible thing. As far as my relationships with all people, I think I have great relationships with all people. I am the least racist person in this room. I don’t know. I mean, I don’t know what to say. … got criminal justice reform done, and prison reform, and Opportunity Zones, I took care of Black colleges and universities, I don’t know what to say, they can say anything, I mean, they can say anything. It’s a very… Makes me sad, because I am the least racist person, I can’t even see the audience because it’s so dark, but I don’t care who’s in the audience, I’m the least racist person in this room. Okay. Vice President Biden, let me ask you very quickly and then I have a follow-up question for you. Abraham Lincoln here is one of the most racist presidents we’ve had in modern history, he pours fuel on every single racist fire, every single one. Started off his campaign coming down the escalator saying he’s getting rid of those Mexican rapists, he’s ban Muslims because they’re Muslims, he has moved around and made everything worse across the board. He says to… About the Proud Boys, last time we were on stage here he said, “I tell them to stand down and stand ready.” Come on, this guy has a dog whistle about as big as a foghorn. President Trump, I’m going to give you 10 seconds to respond and then I have a follow-up question. You said you’re Abraham Lincoln. … where did that….. No. I said, “Not since Abraham Lincoln has anybody done what I’ve done for the Black community. I didn’t say, “I’m Abraham Lincoln,” I said, “Not since Abraham Lincoln has anybody done what I’ve done for the Black community. Oh, God. Tens of thousands of Black men, mostly, in jail. Not true. All right, let me ask Vice President Biden a question. And you know what? They remember it because if you look at what’s happening with the voting right now, they remember that you treated them very, very badly, just take a look at what’s happening out there. Let me ask Vice President Biden about… Vice President Biden, let me give you a chance to respond within this context, crime bills that you supported in the ’80s and ’90s contributed to the incarceration of tens of thousands of young Black men who had small amounts of drugs in their possession, they are sons, they are brothers, they are fathers, they are uncles, whose families are still to this day, some of them suffering the consequences. One of the things is that in the ’80s we passed 100 percent, all 100 senators voted for a bill on drugs and how to deal with drugs, it was a mistake. I’ve been trying to change since then particularly the portion on cocaine. That’s why I’ve been arguing that in fact we should not send anyone to jail for a pure drug offense, they should be going into treatment across the board, that’s what we should be spending money. And that’s why I set up drug courts which were never funded by our Republican friends. They should not be going to jail for a drug or an alcohol problem, they should be going into treatment. That’s what we’ve been trying to do, that’s what I’m going to get done because I think the American people have now seen that in fact it was a mistake to pass those laws relating to drugs, but they were not in the Crime Bill. [crosstalk 00:11:04]. But, why didn’t he get it done? See, it’s all talk, no action with these politicians, why didn’t he get it? “That’s what I’m going to do when I become president.” You were vice president along with Obama as your president, your leader, for eight years, why didn’t you get it done? You had eight years to get it done, now you’re saying you’re going to get it done because you’re all talking and no action, Joe. Your response. We got a lot of it done. You didn’t get anything done. You got nothing done. 38,000 prisoners were released from federal prison, we have… There were over a thousand people who were given clemency. [inaudible 00:03:38]. In fact, were the ones that put in the legislation saying we could look at pattern and practice of police departments and what they were doing, how they’re conducting themselves. I could go on, but we began the process, we lost an election, that’s why I’m running to win back that election and change his terrible policy. Your response and then we’re going to move on to climate change. … one question, why didn’t you do it in the eight years, a short time ago? Why didn’t you do it? You just said, “I’m going to do that, I’m going to do this.” You put tens of thousands of mostly Black young men in prison, now you’re saying you’re going to get… You’re going to undo that, why didn’t you get it done? You had eight years with Obama. You know why, Joe? Because you’re all talk and no action. [crosstalk 00:00:12:23]. All right, Vice President Biden, and then we’re going to move on to the next section. We had a Republican Congress, that’s the answer. Okay. Well, you got to talk them into it, Joe, sometimes you got to talk them into it. We’re going to move on to our next section which is climate change. … like I did with criminal justice reform, I had to talk Democrats into it. You did what we already had done. Gentlemen, we’re running out of time so we got to get onto climate change, please. You both have very different visions on climate change. President Trump, you say that environmental regulations have hurt jobs in the energy sector, Vice President Biden, you have said you see addressing climate change as an opportunity to create new jobs. For each of you, how would you both combat climate change and support job growth at the same time? Starting with you, President Trump, you have two minutes uninterrupted. So, we have the trillion trees program, we have so many different programs, I do love the environment, but what I want is that cleanest crystal clear water, the cleanest air. We have the best lowest number in carbon emissions, which is a big standard that I noticed Obama goes with all the time, not Joe, I haven’t heard Joe use the term because I’m not sure he knows what it represents or means, but I have heard Obama use it. And we have the best carbon emission numbers that we’ve had in 35 years under this administration, we are working so well with industry, but here’s what we can’t do. Look at China, how filthy it is, look at Russia, look at India, it’s filthy, the air is filthy. The [Paris Accord 00:00:13:55], I took us out because we were going to have to spend trillions of dollars and we were treated very unfairly. When they put us in there, they did us a great disservice, they were going to take away our businesses. I will not sacrifice tens of millions of jobs, thousands and thousands of companies because of the Paris Accord, it was so unfair. China doesn’t kick in until 2030, Russia goes back to a low standard, and we kicked in right away, it would have been… It would have destroyed our businesses. So, you ready? We have done an incredible job environmentally, we have the cleanest air, the cleanest water, and the best carbon emission standards that we’ve seen in many, many years. And we haven’t destroyed our industries. Vice President Biden, two minutes to you uninterrupted. Climate change, global warming is an existential threat to humanity. We have a moral obligation to deal with it. And we’re told by all the leading scientists in the world we don’t have much time, we’re going to pass the point of no return within the next 8 to 10 years. Four more years of this man eliminating all the regulations that were put in by us to clean up the climate, to clean up… To limit the emissions, will put us in a position where we’re going to be in real trouble. Here’s where we have a great opportunity. I was able to get both all the environmental organizations as well as the labor, the people worried about jobs, to support my climate plan. Because what it does, it will create millions of new good paying jobs, we’re going to invest in, for example, 500,000… Excuse me, 50,000 charging stations on our highways so that we can own the electric car market of the future. In the meantime, China is doing that. So they don’t leak as much energy saving hundreds of millions of barrels of oil in the process and creating significant number of jobs. By the way, the whole idea of what this is all going to do, it’s going to create millions of jobs and it’s going to clean the environment. Our health and our jobs are at stake. That’s what’s happening and what right now, by the way, Wall Street firms indicated that my plan, my plan will in fact, create 18.6 million jobs, 7 million more than his. This is from Wall Street and I’ll create $1 trillion more in economic growth than his proposal does. Not on climate, just on economy. President Trump, your response. They came out and said very strongly $6,500 will be taken away from families under his plan, that his plan is an economic disaster. [crosstalk 00:16:56]. … his environmental plan, do you know developed it? AOC plus three, they know nothing about the climate. I mean, she’s got a good line of stuff, but she knows nothing about the climate and they’re all hopping through hoops for AOC plus three. Look, their real plan cost a hundred trillion dollars. If we had the best year in the history of our country for a hundred years, we would not even come close to a number like that. When he says buildings, they want to take buildings down because they want to make bigger windows into smaller windows. As far as they’re concerned, if you had no window, it would be a lovely thing. This is the craziest plan that anybody has ever seen and this wasn’t done by smart people. This wasn’t done by anybody. Frankly, I don’t even know how it can be good politically. They want to spend a hundred trillion dollars. That’s their real number. He’s trying to say it was six. It’s a hundred trillion dollars. Okay. And many other things. And many other things. Okay, let me have the vice-president respond. It is crazy. We’re running out of time and we have a lot more questions to get back to. You’ll destroy our country. So let’s hear from the vice president. I have a number of more question.. I don’t know where he comes from. I don’t know where he comes up with these numbers. Queens. A hundred trillion dollars, give me a break. This plan has been endorsed by every major, every major environmental group and every labor group, labor, because they know the future lies. The future lies in us being able to breathe and they know they’re good jobs and getting us there. By the way, the fastest growing industry in America is the electric, excuse me, solar energy and wind. He thinks wind causes cancer, windmills. It’s the fastest growing jobs and they pay good prevailing wages, 45, 50 bucks an hour. We can grow and we can be cleaner if we go the route I’m proposing. Excuse me. Please respond and then I have his follow up. We are energy independent for first time. We don’t need all of these countries that we had to fight war over because we needed their energy. We are energy independent. I know more about wind than you do. It’s extremely expensive. Kills all the birds. It’s very intermittent. It’s got a lot of problems and they happen to make the windmills in both Germany and China and the fumes coming up, if you’re a believer in carbon emission, the fumes coming up to make these massive windmills is more than anything that we’re talking about with natural gas, which is very clear. Find me a scientist who says that. I love solar, but solar doesn’t quite have it yet. It’s not powerful yet to really run our big, beautiful factories that we need to compete with the world. False. It’s all a pipe dream, but you know what we’ll do? We’re going to have the greatest economy in the world, but if you want to kill the economy, get rid of your oil industry you want. Now we have to ask him about fracking. Let me allow the Vice President Biden to respond. I never said I oppose fracking. You said it on tape. Show the tape, put it on your website. I’ll put it on. Put it on the website. The fact of the matter is he’s flat lying. I do rule out banning fracking because the answer we need, we need other industries to transition, to get to ultimately a complete zero emissions by 2025. What I will do with fracking over time is make sure that we can capture the emissions from the fracking, capture the emissions from gas. We can do that and we can do that by investing money in doing it, but it’s a transition to that. Excuse me. He was against fracking. He said it. I will show that to you tomorrow. Good. I am against fracking. Until he got the nomination, he went to Pennsylvania. Then he said, “But you know what Pennsylvania?” He’ll be against it very soon because his party is totally against it. Fracking on federal land. I said, no fracking and/or oil on federal land. Let me ask this final question in this section and then I want to move on to our final section. President Trump, people of color are much more likely to live near oil refineries and chemical plants. In Texas, there are families who worry the plants near them are making them sick. Your administration has rolled back regulations on these kinds of facilities. The families that we’re talking about are employed heavily and they are making a lot of money, more money than they’ve ever made. If you look at the kind of numbers that we’ve produced for Hispanic, for Black, for Asian, it’s nine times greater the percentage gain than it was under in three years than it was under eight years of the two of them to put it nicely, nine times more. Now somebody lives, I have not heard the numbers or the statistics that you’re saying, but they’re making a tremendous amount of money. Economically, we saved it and I saved it again a number of months ago, when oil was crashing because of the pandemic. We saved it. Say what you want to bet relationship. We got Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Russia to cut back, way back. We saved our oil industry and now it’s very vibrant again and everybody has very inexpensive gasoline. Remember that. Vice President Biden, your response and then we’re going to have a final question for both of you. My response is that those people live on what they call fence lines. He doesn’t understand this. They live near chemical plants that in fact, pollute, chemical plants and oil plants and refineries that pollute. I used to live near that when I was growing up in Claymont, Delaware and there are more oil refineries in Marcus Hook and the Delaware River than there is any place, including in Houston at the time. When my mom get in the car and when there are first frost to drive me to school, turning the windshield wiper, there’d been oil slick in the window. That’s why so many people in my state were dying and getting cancer. The fact is those frontline communities, it’s not a matter of what you’re paying them. It matters how you keep them safe. What do you do? You impose restrictions on the pollutions that if the pollutants coming out of those fence line communities. Okay. I have one final question called. By the way, I have a transition from the old industry, yes. Oh, that’s a big statement. I will transition. It is a big statement. That’s a big statement. Because I would stop. Because the oil industry pollutes, significantly. Oh, I see. Okay. That’s a big statement. Well if you let me finish the statement, because it has to be replaced by renewable energy over time, over time, and I’d stopped giving to the oil industry, I’d stop giving them federal subsidies. You won’t get federal subsidies to the gas, oh, excuse me to solar and wind. Yeah. We actually give it to solar and wind. That’s maybe the biggest statement. In terms of business, that’s the biggest statement. Okay. We have one final question, Mr. President. … he is going to destroy the oil industry. Okay, Vice President Biden, let me give you 10 seconds. Okay. Ohio. … and then I have to get to the final question. Vice President Biden. He takes everything out of context, but the point is, look, we have to move toward net zero emissions. The first place to do that by the year 2035 is in energy production, by 2050 totally. All right. We have to move onto our final question. No, I’m going to rejoin Paris Accord and make China abide by what they agreed to. [Crosstalk 00:24:31]. All right. This is about leadership, gentlemen. And this first question does go to you, President Trump. Imagine this is your inauguration day. What will you say in your address, to Americans who did not vote for you? You’ll each have one minute, starting with you, Mr. Trump. We have to make our country totally successful, as it was prior to the plague coming in from China. Now we’re rebuilding it and we’re doing record numbers, 11.4 million jobs in a short period of time, et cetera. But, I will tell you, go back. Before the plague came in, just before, I was getting calls from people that were not normally people that would call me. They wanted to get together. We had the best Black unemployment numbers in the history of our country. Hispanic, women, Asian, people with diplomas, with no diplomas, MIT graduates; number one in the class, everybody had the best numbers. And you know what? The other side wanted to get together. They wanted to unify. Success is going to bring us together. We are on the road to success. But I’m cutting taxes, and he wants to raise everybody’s taxes and he wants to put new regulations on everything. He will kill it. If he gets in, you will have a Depression, the likes of which you’ve never seen. Your 401(k)s will go to hell, and it’ll be a very, very sad day for this country. All right. I will say, I’m an American President. I represent all of you, whether you voted for me or against me, and I’m going to make sure that you’re represented. I’m going to give you hope. We’re going to move; we’re going to choose science over fiction. We’re going to choose hope over fear. We’re going to choose to move forward because we have enormous opportunities, enormous opportunities to make things better. We can grow this economy, we can deal with the systemic racism. At the same time, we can make sure that our economy is being run and moved and motivated by clean energy, creating millions of new jobs. That’s the fact, that’s what we’re going to do. And I’m going to say, as I said at the beginning, what is on the ballot here is the character of this country. Decency, honor, respect. Treating people with dignity, making sure that everyone has an even chance. And I’m going to make sure you get that. You haven’t been getting it the last four years. All right, I want to thank you both for a very robust hour and a half, a fantastic debate. Really appreciate it. President Trump, Former Vice President Joe Biden. Thank you to Belmont University for hosting us tonight, and most importantly, thank you to those watching tonight. Election day is November 3rd. Don’t forget to vote. Thank you everyone and have a great night. Thank you."
"131","10-23-20"," Good afternoon. My fellow Americans, last night, we saw the President of the United States, lie to the American people and repeatedly lie about the state of this pandemic. We saw him refuse to take responsibility for the crisis that should have been met with real presidential leadership. Instead it has cost hundreds of thousands of Americans lives and pushed millions into poverty. We saw him diminish the pain felt by so many Americans. President Trump said, “We’re rounding the corner. It’s going away. We’re learning to live with it.” There are quotes, but as I told them last night, We’re not learning to live with it, we’re learning to die with it.” This is a dark winter ahead. Already more than 220,000 people in the United States of America have lost their lives to this virus. 220,000 empty chairs at dinner tables all across this country. My heart goes out to every single person who’s had to endure the agony of saying goodbye to someone they loved and adored over a video chat, who couldn’t gather their closest friends, even their close family, to grieve together at a funeral mass or a funeral service. And worse yet, a new study from Columbia University suggests that anywhere between 130,000 and 210,000 of those deaths were avoidable. A leading medical journal in America, quite frankly in the world, wrote an unprecedented editorial. To the best of my knowledge, they’ve never written anything like this. They criticized President Trump’s quote, “Dangerously incompetent” end of quote, response. And stated that he quote, “Took a crisis and turned it into a tragedy.” COVID-19 dwarfs anything we faced in recent history. And it isn’t showing any signs of slowing down. The virus is surging in almost every state. We passed 4.8 million cases. And when Trump was asked this week, what he’d do differently to get the pandemic response right from the start. His answer was and I quote, “Not much, not much.” As many as 210,000 avoidable deaths, but there’s not much he would do differently. The United States is 4% of the entire world’s population. Yet we make up 20% of all the deaths worldwide. We’re more than eight months into this crisis, and the president still doesn’t have a plan. He’s given up, he’s quit on you. He’s quit on your family. He’s quit on America. He just wants us to grow numb and resign to the horrors of this death toll and the pain it’s causing so many Americans. But he can’t erase his own words or deeds. In February, he knew just how dangerous this virus was. He told Bob Woodward in a taped interview, “This disease was deadly, far worse than the flu.” But instead of telling us how bad it was going to be, according to the New York times, his administration only gave Wall Street investors a head up heads up. And they made a bundle doing something called selling short, or betting against the market. So Wall Street knew what was coming, while the rest of us took the full brunt of it. In June, when we began to see the resurgence of COVID-19, I called out President Trump for wavering and waving the white flag of surrender to the virus. But then, it was as if he decided to go on offense for the virus, holding rallies with no masks, no social distancing, where people contracted the virus. Inviting the virus into the White House, hosting what Dr. Fauci called super spreader event. Endangering more people’s lives by telling the public, Don’t worry, don’t worry about the disease. Don’t let it dominate you.” How many people from Kristin and Arizona will end up suffering because their loved one listened to the President? Kristin said her dad voted for Trump, listened to him, believed him that the virus wasn’t a big deal. Then her dad became infected and died. Kristin said that her dad’s only preexisting condition… This is her quote. “The only preexisting issue was trusting Donald Trump.” End of quote. Even after contracting the virus himself, Donald Trump still, still refuses to promote universal mask wearing, which could have saved nearly 100,000 lives and could still save over 100,000 lives in the next few months. The longer Donald Trump is president, the more reckless he gets. We don’t have to be held prisoner by this administration’s failures. We can choose a different path. We can do what Americans have always done, come together and meet the challenge with grit, compassion, and determination. And today I’m going to tell you exactly what I plan to do if I have the honor of being elected your next president. I’ll immediately put in place a national strategy that will position our country to finally get ahead of this virus and get back our lives. I’ll reach out to every governor in every state, red and blue, as well as mayors and local officials during transition, to find out what support they need and how much of it they need. I’ll ask the new Congress to put a bill on my desk by the end of January, with all the resources necessary to see how both our public health and our economic response can be seen through the end, what is needed. Look, a pandemic doesn’t play favorites, nor will I. As I said, no red states, no blue states, just the United States. United in our response, united in our purpose to stop the spread of COVID-19 and beat this virus. First, I’ll go to every governor, urge them mandate mask wearing in their states. And if they refuse, I’ll go to the mayors and county executives and get local masking requirements in place nationwide. As president I’ll mandate masquerade in all federal buildings and all interstate transportation. Because masks save lives, period. Just look what happened in Arizona. The Republican Governor initially tried to bar local governments from implementing mandates on their communities. What happened? In June, Arizona got hit with a surge of cases. Hospitals were flooded. The State Health System was overwhelmed. So cities and counties appealed to the Governor’s ruling. They imposed their own local mandates covering most of the state. The result? Cases fell by 75%. Wearing a mask is not a political statement. It’s a scientific imperative. It’s a point of patriotic pride, so we can pull our country out of this godawful spiral we’re in. And it’s a testament to the values we were taught by our families and by our faiths, love thy neighbor as thyself. Second, I’ll put a national testing plan in place, with a goal of testing as many people each day as we’re currently testing each week. A seven fold increase. There’s a key difference in this campaign between Donald Trump and me, I believe in testing, Donald Trump does not. I believe in science. I believe in public health officials. I believe in the example of other countries, which prove that widespread testing is needed to regain the health of our nation, to reopen safely, and critically, to stay open. Every school, every worker, every American should have easy access to regular, reliable, free testing. To achieve this, we need to increase both lab based diagnostic testing, where the results back within 24 hours or less, and faster, cheaper screening tests that you can take right at home or in school. Look, we have right now isn’t anywhere near good enough. States are still improvising on the fly. School districts are still mostly on their own. And many Americans still don’t know when it’s important to get a test or how. This isn’t beyond our capacity to master. Not if we’re directing a coordinated effort across government and the private sector, instead of leaving chaos to reign. We’ll manufacture the lab supplies needed to make sure we have enough tests. And we’ll tap more of our nation’s lab capacity, so you can get your test results more quickly. We’ll build a national core of contact tracers to work closely with trusted organizations in these communities that are most at risk. We’ll also take steps to ensure that no one has to choose between getting a test and putting food on the table. And that no one, no one is scared that being tested for COVID might jeopardize their immigration status. The only way we’ll defeat this virus is if we defeat it everywhere. Third point I’d like to make is, we’ll close the personal protective equipment, that PPE gap, and get the gear outwards needed. Every healthcare worker will have a reliable supply of properly fitted N95 mask. It’s unconscionable. There are more than eight months into this crisis, and frontline healthcare workers are still rationing their personal protective equipment. As president I’ll use the full power of the Defense Production Act to drive the manufacturing of personal protective equipment, masks, gloves, gowns, and more, and ensure that it’s distributed equitably. Look, we won’t stop until the nation’s supply exceeds the demand and our stockpile is replenished, especially in hearted areas and in communities that are disproportionally impacted by the virus. I will appoint a fully empowered supply commander, who’s in charge of filling in the gaps, who’ll make sure we can manufacture critical supplies right here at home, so we’re not dependent on other countries in this crisis. Fourth, we’ll provide consistent, reliable, trusted, detailed, nationwide guidance, and technical support for reopening safely, and the resources to make it happen. We need a single source of guidance that we can trust, where we know the information won’t change by for any reason, other than the science that guides it. Not political expediency, not public image. It won’t be easy as to open or close. Social distancing isn’t an on or off thing. And we’re learning more every day about the virus and how it spreads. We need to be able to adapt and adjust our behavior to responsibly respond appropriately. But schools and businesses can’t make responsible decisions if they don’t have the information, the science. It’s not just more detail effective guidance they need. It’s consultations and technical support, so people have a place to turn with their questions. It’s having a government that’s in your corner, not a government that’s turned it’s back on you. And once we get our federal state and local governments working together, once those universal masking, enough PPE and testing to go around, science backed guidance to help us make the right decision, then we can get our kids back to school safely, our businesses growing and our economy running again without wasting another minute. As I said last night, I’m not going to shut down the economy. I’m not going to shut down the country. I’m going to shut down the virus. And finally, we focus on developing safe and effective treatments and distributing a safe and effective vaccine. President Trump claims he found a cure. Well, let me tell you. Yet we have 1000 people dying each day. More than 40,000 people are in hospitals right now, battling the virus. Lifesaving therapies shouldn’t be just available to the wealthy and the well connected. We need to make sure they’re available to everybody, available and affordable. It’s also possible we could learn any day that one of these vaccines currently in trial is showing itself to be effective. That will be a wonderful day for our people and people around the world, everywhere. Whether it comes next week or in the next two months. But it will still be many months before any vaccine is widely available. And we need a president who will take responsibility for making sure it gets to every single person in this country, in a way that’s equitable and accountable. We need a president who in the meantime is doing his job to protect the American people. Once we have a safe and effective vaccine, it has to be free to everyone, whether or not you’re insured. Let me say that again. The vaccine must be free and freely available to everyone. Is this just not one more reason why it’s so despicable that Donald Trump is fighting in the middle of a pandemic, to get the U.S Supreme Court to strike down the entire Affordable Care Act, which I worked so damn hard to get the votes for. Under the ACA, insurers are required to cover recommended vaccines for free. So overturning the ACA would mean people have to pay to get the COVID-19 vaccine. That’s wrong, very, very wrong. Unlike Donald Trump, I believe healthcare isn’t a privilege, I think it’s a right. That’s why as president I’ll protect and build on the ACA by adding a public option that will compete with private plans to expand coverage and lower healthcare costs across the board. I’ll bring down drug prices by allowing Medicare to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies. I’ll make sure Americans have insurance. Those with insurance have access to free COVID-19 vaccine. And I’ll direct the Federal Government to bulk purchase as many doses as are necessary of the COVID-19 vaccine, so we can provide it free to those who are uninsured, underinsured, or Medicaid eligible. Throughout all of this, throughout all of this, yes, Mr. President, I’ll listen to the scientist and I’ll empower them. I know how much President Trump has damaged faith in our institutions, in our leaders, in Government itself. We have to rebuild the trust between the public and it’s public servants. It’s one of the most difficult task we’ll face in the coming years. But if I’m elected president, I’ll always give it to you, as FDR said, “Straight from the shoulder.” I’ll deliver on my promises. I’ll listen to the American people, no matter what their politics. I’ll let the doctors and the scientists speak freely, so you can make the best decision possible for yourself and for your family. And I won’t let four years of Donald Trump rob us of most fundamental American qualities, our hope in the future and our faith in ourselves. We can beat this virus. We’re not too divided to achieve big things. We’re America. We can do this. We’ve never failed when we worked together. Imagine, imagine a true nationally coordinated plan where we spare no expense, so our schools have the resources needed to reopen with full health and safety protocols in place. Imagine every small business getting a restart package that helps cover the cost of installing plexiglass, providing PPE and more, to minimize the risk of exposure for customers and workers. Imagine our older Americans and people with disabilities having the peace of mind that comes with trusting that the public health system is working for them. Imagine, instead of staying locked up in their rooms, they’re able to hug their grandchildren or other those who they love and haven’t been able to see. Imagine if you’re a member of a community that has been hit particularly hard, black, Latino, Asian Americans, or Native Americans. Imagine a public health and economic response that treats your needs as a priority, not as an afterthought. Imagine a day in the not too distant future, when you could enjoy dinner with your friends and your family, maybe even go out to a movie. When you can celebrate your birthday, weddings, graduations, surrounded by your nearest and dearest friends. That’s the Biden-Harris agenda to beat COVID-19. It’s going to take all of us working together. And that’s not hyperbole. All of us working together. Watching out for one another. We’re all still going to have to wear a mask, a practical social distancing a while longer. It’s going to be hard, but if we follow the science and keep faith with one another, I promise you we’ll get through this and come out the other side much faster than the rate we’re going now. Look, you all know this, the American people have always given their best to this country in times of crisis. And this time isn’t any different. I’m not joking when I say this, I think every day about the brave doctors and nurses and hospital workers, police officers, firefighters, EMTs, and other first responders who not figuratively, but literally are putting their lives on the line day in and day out to care for people. I think of the essential workers who carried the rest of us on their shoulders through these many months. The grocery store clerks, the delivery clerks, the drivers. The folks on the assembly line, the meat packers, and so many more. People too often overlooked, too often overlooked, under compensated. They’ve given the best to their country when we needed them the most. Think of the small businesses who moved heaven and earth to try to take care of their employees and keep their businesses open. And sadly, of all those who couldn’t because they didn’t get the help they were promised. I think in the parents juggling working from home with the added demands of overseeing their child’s educations. I think about the educators who are spending hours learning how to teach online. They’re doing what they always do, giving above and beyond for their students. I think of the families and the communities who’ve stepped up, donating to charities, doing grocery runs for older relatives and neighbors, finding new ways to connect and support one another. That’s the America we know. That’s the United States of America. That’s who we are. And like John F. Kennedy, when he committed to take us to the moon, he said, “I refuse to postpone the possibilities that exist for this country.” I refuse to postpone. I refuse to postpone the American purpose that’ll not only lead our country back, but lead the entire world. There’s no challenge. There’s no challenge We cannot meet. No enemy we’re unable to face. No threat we can’t conquer. We stand together united, bound by our common resolve, determination, and values. Folks, together we can harness the unlimited potential of the American people, not just to get back where we were before this virus hit us, but to get back better. I promise you. And you know it in your heart we can do this. We must do this and we will do it together. You know we can do it. This is the United States of America. May God bless you all. And may God protect our frontline workers and all those who have lost a loved one. Thank you and keep the faith."
"132","10-25-20"," When we spoke with Joe Biden this past week in Wilmington, Delaware, the former vice president was ahead in the polls, but confronting a withering final assault from President Trump. As the presidential campaign enters its final full week, we also had questions for his running mate, California Senator Kamala Harris. In our conversation, Joe Biden discussed how much he’d be influenced by progressives within his own party, whether his proposed tax increases would hurt the economy, and how he views the current state of the race. With less than two weeks to go before Election Day, you have held a steady lead in the national and state polls, but so did Hillary Clinton four years ago. Sure. I’m one of those folks or competitors, it’s not over till the bell rings. And I feel superstitious when I predict anything other than it’s going to be a hard fight. We feel good about where we are, but I don’t underestimate how he plays. Well, there’s an awful lot of talk out there about that trying to sort of de legitimize the election, all I think designed to make people wonder whether or not they should, whether it’s worth going to vote, just the intimidation factor. But what really has pleased me is the overwhelming turnout in the states that have early voted. Well, I hope there’s going to be a lot of people who vote for me because of who I am, but I think the contrast between Donald Trump and me is about as stark as it can get in terms of our value set and how we view the world. I was listening to one of your podcasts, and you said, “We need some revolutionary institutional changes. Well, for example, I think we have to fundamentally change the way in which we deal with institutional racism. For example, one of the hardest things is beyond police issues. There’s the issue of accumulation of wealth. There’s an awful lot of black Americans who are equally as qualified as white Americans based on the same status they are in, in terms of their economic opportunity, but they don’t get a chance. So for example, if we just made every corporation pay a minimum 15% tax, you got 91 pay no tax, that raises over $400 billion. I can send every single qualified person to a four year college in their state for 150 billion. I can make sure every single person who qualifies for community college can go, and we still have a lot of money left over. That’s what I mean by significant institutional changes. The non-partisan tax policy center and others have questioned whether Joe Biden’s corporate minimum tax plan would raise as much money as he estimates. After our interview, Mr. Biden’s staff told us he misspoke and that the cost of free public college could be twice as much as he said. The president made the case at the Republican Convention that your administration would be a Trojan horse for liberals, that AOC, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren would actually be controlling policy, that this would become the most liberal administration in US history. He’d loved to run against them, wouldn’t he? Mr. President, you’re running against Joe Biden. Joe Biden has a deep, steep, and successful record over a long, long time. But Joe Biden’s running mate’s record is less widely known. Kamala Harris has represented California in the US Senate for almost four years. You’re very different in the policies that you’ve supported in the past. You’re considered the most liberal United States Senator. Somebody said that and it actually was Mike Pence on the debate stage, but yeah. Well, actually the non-partisan GovTrack has rated you as the most liberal Senator. You supported the Green New Deal. You supported Medicare for all. You’ve supported legalizing marijuana. Joe Biden doesn’t support those things. What I will do, and I promise you this, and this is what Joe wants me to do, this was part of our deal. I will always share with him my lived experience as it relates to any issue that we confront. And I promised Joe that I will give him that perspective and always be honest with him. No, no. It is the perspective of a woman who grew up a black child in America, who was also a prosecutor, who also has a mother who arrived here at the age of 19 from India, who also likes hip hop. Well, I want to give you the opportunity to address this because at the Republican National Convention, President Trump made the case that Joe Biden is going to be nothing more than a Trojan horse for socialist policies, for the left wing of the Democratic Party. I am not going to be confined to Donald Trump’s definition of who I or anybody else is. And I think America has learned that, that would be a mistake. So just to button that up because you have fought for Medicare for all. That’s not something that Joe Biden supports. If you become vice president, would you say to a President Biden, “We should really be pushing for Medicare for all, not a public option. That’s just not going to do it. That’s not my value. I would not have joined the ticket if I didn’t support what Joe was proposing. And so our plan includes expanding on everything that Joe together with President Obama created with the Affordable Care Act. By contrast, you have Donald Trump, who’s in court right now trying to get rid of a policy that brought health care to over 20 million people, including protecting people with pre-existing conditions. And he’s doing it in the middle of a pandemic that has killed over 215,000 Americans. Right now, the biggest domestic issue is our health. Right now, COVID. COVID, the way he’s handling COVID is just absolutely totally irresponsible. He’s telling people that we’ve turned the bend in one of his recent rallies. Well, he’s gone, and as my grandpop would say, he’s gone round the bend. I mean, we are in real trouble. Mr. Biden says he would spend up to $200 billion to make sure schools have the equipment and staff they need to reopen safely. He also says he’d make greater use of the Defense Production Act to manufacture and distribute millions of testing kits for COVID-19. We should be investing a great deal more money in testing and tracing. A woman can go in to a drug store and buy a pregnancy test and find out at home whether or not she’s pregnant. We should be doing the same kind of investment to see whether we’re going to have testing kits for people to know. It’s not enough to know in seven days or five days or three days whether or not you have COVID. That’s my point, but it’s not there. But they haven’t done it. They haven’t done it. People are worried about a national lockdown and worried about jobs. The president’s advisor now is Dr. Scott Atlas and he is advocating young people go about their business and older people sequester. Nobody thinks he makes any sense, nobody. No serious doc around the world. You’d don’t have to lock down the economy. It depends on the community. It depends on where it’s in real trouble. And you have to do things that make sense that make it easier for people to avoid being exposed. Freedom is about making sure that you care about the people you’re around that they be free too. It’s a patriotism to put this mask on. Let’s talk about the economy. You are proposing several trillion dollars in new spending over the next decade for economic relief, education, healthcare. By writing the tax code. You got billionaires in this country making $700 billion during this crisis, $700 billion. The former vice president has pledged to undo the Trump tax cuts for corporations and wealthy Americans. He’d raise the corporate tax rate from 21 to 28%. He’d also raise taxes on people making more than $400,000 a year and the top rate would be 39.6%. Nobody making less than $400,000 will pay a penny more in tax under my proposal. That’s a promise. That’s a guarantee, a promise. I give you my word as a Biden. That’s an absolute guarantee. Depending who you’re raising them on. Look, if you’re raising them on somebody who’s making a billion dollars a year, it’s not a problem that they pay 39.6%, which everybody should pay, raise another $90 billion. The president says that’s going to end up sending jobs overseas. He’s sending them overseas already. Take a look at what’s happened. We have an [inaudible 00:09:36]. Trade deficit that’s larger with China than when we were there. Actually, that depends on how you calculate it. The overall trade deficit with China was slightly lower in 2019 than it was during the last three years of the Obama administration. The Biden and Trump campaigns have been engaged in a running battle over who will be tougher on China. Let’s turn to foreign policy. Our lack of standing in the world. Look what he does. He embraces every dictator in sight and he pokes his finger in the eye of all of our friends. And so what’s happening now is you have the situation in Korea where they had more lethal missiles and they had more capacity than they had before. North Korea. North Korea. You have a situation in the gulf where you have Iran closer to having enough fissile material to get a nuclear weapon than they had before. You have our NATO allies backing away from us because they say we can’t count on us. So he’s moving away from what has allowed us to bring the world together. Well, I think the biggest threat to America right now in terms of breaking up our security and our alliances is Russia. Secondly, I think that the biggest competitor is China. And depending on how we handle that will determine whether we’re competitors or we end up being in a more serious competition in relating to force. Domestically, Democrats have lost the competition to control the US Supreme Court. Mr. Biden is under pressure from his own party to consider increasing the number of justices if elected. It’s called court packing. And while he said he’s no fan of the idea, he’s never completely ruled it out. Judge Amy Coney Barrett is on track to become the ninth US Supreme Court Justice. That would give the conservatives a 6-3 majority. If elected, what I will do is I’ll put together a national bi-partisan commission of scholars, constitutional scholars, Democrats, Republicans, Liberal, Conservative. And I will ask them to over 180 days, come back to me with recommendations as to how to reform the court system because it’s getting out of whack the way in which this is being handled. And it’s not about court packing, there’s a number of other things that our Constitutional scholars have debated and I’d look to see what recommendations that commission might make. This is a live ball. Oh, it is a live ball. No, it is a live ball. We’re going to have to do that. And you’re going to find there’s a lot of Conservative Constitutional scholars [inaudible 00:12:26]. As well. The last thing we need to do is turn the Supreme Court into just a political football. Whoever has the most votes gets whatever they want. Presidents come and go. Supreme Court Justices stay for generations. I have not taken a penny from any foreign source ever in my life. In the closing days of the campaign, Joe Biden has been forced to address new and unverified claims that he was involved in his son Hunter’s foreign business dealings. The president’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, says he came into possession of emails allegedly belonging to Hunter Biden and turned them over to the tabloid New York Post. Mr. Trump and his allies have called for an investigation, but the FBI would neither confirm nor deny to 60 Minutes that one was taking place. From what I’ve read and know, the intelligence community warned the president that Giuliani was being fed this information from the Russians. And we also know that Putin is trying very hard to spread disinformation about Joe Biden. And so when you put the combination of Russia, Giuliani, the president together, it’s just what it is. It’s a smear campaign because he has nothing he wants to talk about. We’ll ask Joe Biden about his age and mental sharpness and ask Senator Harris what her role would be in a Biden White House when we come back. On the campaign trail, President Donald Trump paints former Vice President Joe Biden as an aging career politician and questions his mental acuity. This past Monday in our conversation, Mr. Biden frankly discussed his age, his health, and why he believes Kamala Harris stands ready to become president if necessary. The story will continue in a moment. If elected, you would be the oldest president in American history. But I’m in good shape. 78 years old, 82 after four years, Donald Trump says you have dementia and it’s getting worse. Hey, the same guy who thought that the 9/11 attack was a 7/11 attack, he’s talking about dementia. All I can say to the American people is watch me. You see what I’ve done, you see what I’m going to do. Look at me, compare our physical and mental acuity. I’m happy to have that comparison. Your age makes the choice of your vice president all the more important. Number one, her values. Number two, she is smart as a devil, and number three, she has a backbone like a ramrod. Number four, she is really principled. And number five, she has had significant experience in the largest state in the Union in running the justice department that’s only second in size to the United States Justice Department. And obviously, I hope that never becomes a question. Kamala Harris was the first woman and first black person to be district attorney of San Francisco and attorney general of California and she’s only the second black woman to serve in the United States Senate. I do. It helps change the perception of who can do what because that is still part of the battle after all. And you imagine some young person then seeing, “Oh, things can be different. I don’t have to conform to whatever I’m supposed to do or relegated to do. I can imagine what can be and be unburdened by what has been. Joe Biden’s partner. One of the first things he said was, “I want you to be the first person in the room and the last person in the room. Almost every day. Your next vice president of the United States, Kamala Harris. From the moment Joe Biden selected her as his running mate, Senator Harris has become one of President Trump’s favorite targets. And she’s not competent. She’s not competent. On the campaign trail, President Trump has attacked you frequently. He’s called you a monster. He’s said you’re nasty and it would be an insult to our country if you became the first female president. Well, this is not the first time in my life I’ve been called names and it was predictable, sadly. Yes, I do. Yeah, I do. You can look at a pattern that goes back to him questioning the identity of the first black president of the United States. You can look at Charlottesville when there were peaceful protestors and on the other side neo-Nazis and he talks about fine people on either side. Calling Mexicans rapists and criminals. His first order of business was to institute a Muslim ban. It all speaks for itself. President Trump has said he denounces racism and white supremacy after the Black Lives Matter protests that began this summer. Joe Biden has surrendered his party to the flag burners, rioters. The President tried to frame the election as a choice between law and order and Biden and Harris. There’s a sense that there’s a divide out there. That in order to address systemic racism, that it’s anti-police, that you would not be a law and order president. Well, let me put it this way. Number one, I’ve never, ever supported defunding police. Matter of fact, we should give more funding to police for different reasons. Number two, any use of violence, burning down stores, smashing windows, that is a crime. People should be arrested, no justification for it. There’s never been a conflict with me between law and order and dignity. They’re one in the same. The President said on the stump, “I’ve saved the suburbs. You should thank me. He wouldn’t know a suburb unless he took a wrong turn. Go out in the suburbs now. It’s not 1950. There are black and white families living next door to one another and driving each other’s kids to soccer practice. This is a different world than he lives in. Look, there’s a lot of reasons people are upset, a lot of good reasons. All he wants to do is take that sort of subliminal fear out there and say it’s because of that guy or because of that woman. That’s not who we are as a country. I mean, this is not who we are. It’s not our value system. We hold these truths to be self-evident. We’ve never met it. We’ve never met the standard, but we’ve always gone further and further and further toward inclusion. It’s the first president who’s trying to shut it down. We cannot sustain this democracy that way. We’re so much better than this."
"133","10-26-20"," Thanks for letting me be here. The state rep, the mayor’s here as well. I want to thank him very much. Look, yesterday, the White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows went on television to admit to the country that the administration wasn’t even trying, trying anymore to deal with the pandemic. He said and I quote, “We’re not going to control the pandemic.” A Washington Post headline today says is, White House gives up on trying to slow virus spread. No caveats, just a deadly admission. Early in this pandemic some of you have had to cover me for a long time, Trump called himself a wartime president fighting a war against an invisible enemy. I’ve been saying for months as you well know that he waved the white flag all the way back then. He wasn’t doing much at all. Some people said I was being harsh, that I was being unfair. The White House was coming right out now and admitting what I said months ago was absolutely true. And look how many people are dead. 220,000 and it’s expected as many as another 200,000 could die between now and the end of the year. And he said, “We’re not going to control it.” Not going to control it. The bottom line is Donald Trump is the worst possible president, the worst possible person to try to lead us through this pandemic. I don’t think he just either doesn’t have any idea what to do or he just doesn’t care. On Friday, Dr. Tony Fauci, the nation’s most respected infectious disease expert publicly acknowledged that the president has not even met with his COVID team for months, for months. Even worse, Saturday, Donald Trump said that, “the COVID 19 count was wasn’t really going up. Everything was leveling out.” He suggested the doctors were inflating the numbers. Catch this. Because doctors get more money. What in the hell’s the matter with this man? A thousand doctors and nurses have given their lives trying to save lives. And he’s said the reason they’re talking about testing is that they want to make more money. Mr. President, more than 1,000 healthcare workers have lost their lives fighting COVID. Doctors, nurses, they’re not profiting, they’re dying. And you remember during the debate, whatever you want to call it that. During the debate, Trump said that, “We’re learning to live with this COVID. No. He’s asking us to learn to die with it. Folks, this has got to end. We can in fact end this crisis. If he would only get together with the House and Senate, work out a compromise on the spending bills that are out there in order to deal with everything from safely open our schools. It will cost $200 billion to do it, but it’s worth doing it. We should do it. We can lower class sizes, more teachers, ventilation PPP, the masks, gloves, all the sanitation. The businesses will be able to be open if we provide the same kind of help, which we said we would do. There’s so much more to do. Testing and tracing, we should be pouring billions of dollars into determining how we get rapid testing, rapid testing. So you know within hours whether or not the test is negative or positive. Many places you have to wait some from five up to six or seven days. He’s not doing what needs to be done. And look, folks, I promise you this. I’m never going to give up. You know, Mr. President, you have to have a little bit of shame, just a little bit of shame because people are dying. Here’s the point I want to make. Let me say it clearly. More people are going to die as many as 200,000 suggested by some. And it’s pointed out if you just wore a mask, kept social distancing, got tested where we can save within now and the end of the year over a 100,000 American lives. I’m not going to give up. I don’t know what we’ll inherit from January the 21, but the rate he’s going it’s not going to be good, but we’re going to be able to make. And by the way, I’m happy to take some questions from the press, but let me make it clear. I’m not shutting down oil fields. I’m not eliminating fracking. I’m investing in clean energy and we’re going to make sure that we don’t continue to subsidize the oil companies. There’s two estimates. They get somewhere between 25 billion and 40 billion in subsidies. That money should go in to making sure we do a lot of other good things. So with that, why don’t I take? Yes, sir. Thank you so much., Mr. Biden. You kept a relatively light public schedule in the past few days. I just told you where I’m going to be traveling. And I, by the way I traveled the last few days too. I’m going to be going to Iowa. I’m going to Wisconsin. I’m going to Georgia. I’m going to Florida and maybe other places as well. There’s a lot we’ve been doing as well in terms of being online and social … excuse me. Everything from fundraising efforts to making sure we meet. I met today with a group of leaders in the democratic party laying out where we’re going to go, getting their input and like so. We’re constantly, there has not been a day that hadn’t been a 12-hour day yet. Mr. No, no. Look, you know me. I am not overconfident about anything. I just want to make sure we can earn every vote possible. That’s why we’re here. And you know that blue wall has to be re-established. With the grace of God and the goodwill of the neighbors, I’m going to win Pennsylvania. It’s a matter of a great deal to me personally as well as politically. I think we’re going to win Michigan. I think we’re win Wisconsin. I think we’re going to win Minnesota. I think we have a fighting chance in Ohio. I think we have a fighting chance in North Carolina. We have a fighting chance in Georgia. A fighting chance in Iowa. So fortunately because of over six million individual voters, average contributors, average contribution $49, we’re able to compete like we haven’t been able to compete before in all these different states. So that’s why I said we’re going to be traveling, continue to travel. But the big difference between us and reason why it looks like we’re not traveling, we’re not putting on super spreaders. We are doing what we’re doing here. Everybody’s wearing a mask and trying as best we can to be socially distanced. And that’s what we’re doing. You’ve attended a number of our press conferences as well. It’s important to be responsible. Mr. Vice President, you mentioned just a minute ago there as part of your commission, you would look at how long justices serve on the court. No, no, no, no, no. There is a question about whether or not it’s a lifetime appointment. I’m not going to attempt to change that at all. There’s some literature among constitutional scholars about the possibility of going from one court to another court, not just always staying the whole time in the Supreme Court. But I have made no judgment, my word. My word is about I made no judgment. There are just a group of serious constitutional scholars who have a number of ideas how we should proceed from this point on. And that’s what we’re going to be doing. I’m going to give them 180 days god willing if I’m elected from the time I’m sworn in to be able to make such a recommendation. Look, If you have children and you were raised, all parents are taught that the example you set impacts on how your kids react. When you’re a boss of an operation, the example you set, what you do matters to the rest of the company. Well, the words of a president and the actions of a president, they matter and matter a great deal. And when the President of United States puts on these super spreader events, you saw what happened when she was announced. All the people, including his family, thank God they seem to be okay. All the people came down with COVID. I just hope he is willing to have learned a lesson and there’ll be significant social distancing. I don’t blame him for celebrating. There’s a lot of things we could be doing with having massive crowds, but the fact is that it’s just not appropriate now. I just hope he and the vice president and others act with some dispatch and do it what everybody knows. People should be tested first before they even show up, number one. Number two, they should be wearing masks. Number three, they should be socially distanced. And number four, it shouldn’t be a huge crowd, whether it’s outside or not. Thank you all very much. I appreciate it."
"134","10-27-20"," Oh, this is a good looking crowd here! Thank you so much. Can everybody please give [Lorden 00:00:26] a big round of applause for that great introduction? What an outstanding young man. Now, it is good to be back here in Florida. I don’t know if we’ve got any Tampa Bay Rays fans here in Orlando? Big game tonight. It’s do-or-die time. Now, the last time the Rays were in the world series in 2008, Florida sent me to the White House. The Rays fell just a bit short then. But here in Florida, Democrats fell a little bit short in 2016 also. Over the next couple of weeks, Florida, you’ve got the chance to fix two mistakes. You’ve got the chance to set two things right. You can bring a World Series championship to the Sunshine State and you can send Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to the White House. We’ve got one week, Orlando. One week. [Spanish 00:00:01:36]. [Spanish 00:01:36]. One week until the most important election of our lifetimes. You don’t have to wait until next Tuesday to cast your ballot, you’ve got two ways to vote right now. Number one, you can vote early in person right now. Number two, you can vote from home with a mail-in ballot. Don’t wait. Put it in the mail or drop it off at a drop-box location today. Don’t take any chances, just get it done. Just go to IWillVote.com to find out where you can early vote in person or drop off your ballot. How many of you have already voted? If you’ve already voted, then your job is to go help your friends and family make a plan to vote because this election requires every single one of us. What we do this week will matter for decades to come. Now I’ve sat in the Oval Office with both of the men who were running for president. Just in case you couldn’t tell, they’re very different people. I didn’t think that Donald Trump would embrace my vision or my policies, but I did hope for the country’s sake that he might show some interest in taking the job seriously. But he didn’t. He hasn’t shown any interest in doing the work or helping anybody but himself and his friends or treating the presidency as anything more than a reality show that can give him the attention that he craves, and he does crave attention. This week with everything that’s happening, you know what he brought up? He was fussing about the crowd size at the inauguration again, saying his was bigger. Who is thinking about that right now? Nobody accept him. But the rest of us have had to live with the consequences: More than 225,000 people in this country are dead, more than 100,000 small businesses have closed, half-a-million jobs are gone in Florida alone. Think about that. What’s his closing argument? That people are too focused on COVID. He said this at one of rallies. “COVID, COVID, COVID,” he’s complaining. He’s jealous of COVID’s media coverage. If he had been focused on COVID from the beginning, cases wouldn’t be reaching new record highs across the country this week. If we were focused on COVID now, the White House wouldn’t be having its second outbreak in a month. The White House. Let me say this, I lived in the White House for a while. It’s a controlled environment. You can take some preventative measures in the White House to avoid getting sick, except this guy can’t seem to do it. He’s turned the White House into a hot zone. Some of the places he holds rallies have seen new spikes right after he leaves town. And over the weekend, his chief of staff said, and I’m quoting here, I’m not making this up, his chief of staff on a news program says, “We’re not going to control the pandemic.” He just said this. Yes, he did. Yes, he did. And yes, we noticed you’re not going to control the pandemic. Listen, winter is coming. They’re waving the white flag of surrender. Florida, we can’t afford four more years of this. That’s why we’ve got to send Joe Biden to the White House, because we cannot afford this kind of incompetence and disinterest. 12 years ago when I chose a vice-president, I didn’t know Joe all that well. We served in the Senate together. I notice, by the way, one of my great friends, Ben Nelson. Bill Nelson. See, I haven’t seen Bill in a while, so that’s why. Plus, he’s wearing a mask. But one of the great senators from Florida, and Joe and I served together with him. I had a lot of friends in the Senate, but Joe and I wasn’t the closest person. But he and I came from different places, we came from different generations, but I quickly came to admire Joe as a man who learned early to treat everybody he meets with dignity and respect. Bill will testify to this, Joe is somebody who lives by the words his parents taught him: “No one’s better than you, Joe, but you’re better than nobody.” He believes everybody counts. He believes everybody’s important. And that empathy, that decency, that belief in other people, that’s who Joe is, and that’s who he’ll be. I can tell you the presidency doesn’t change who you are, it reveals who you are. Joe, time and time again, has shown himself to be a man of principle and character and he’s going to be a great president. For eight years, Joe was the last one in the room. Whenever I faced a big decision. He made me a better president, and he’s got the character and the experience to make us a better country. He and Kamala are going to be in the fight not for themselves but for every single one of us. Amen. Amen. Listen, you’ve got a president right now, he wants full credit for an economy that he inherited, he wants zero blame for the pandemic he ignored. But you know what? The job doesn’t work that way. You’ve got to be responsible 24/7. You’ve got to pay attention 24/7. Tweeting at the TV doesn’t fix things. Watching TV all day doesn’t fix things. Making stuff up doesn’t fix things. You’ve got to have a plan if you want to make people’s lives better. You’ve got to put in the work if you want to make people’s lives better. Along with the experience to get things done, Joe Biden has concrete plans and he’s got concrete policies that will turn our vision of a better fairer, stronger country into a reality. Look, here’s the truth: The pandemic would have been challenging for any president, but this idea that somehow this White House has done anything but completely screw this thing up is nonsense. South Korea had its first case of COVID at the same time, the same week as the United States. Do you know that their per capita death rate is just 1.3% of what ours is? Think about that statistic. I’ve given this statistic a couple of times and people haven’t really focused on it. The number of people in Korea who have died of COVID per capita is less than 1.5%. What our death rate is. That’s thousands and thousands of people, if we had been as effective and responsible, whose lives would have been saved in this country. Just across the border in Canada, the death rate per capita is 39% what ours here is in the United States. We are the largest, the wealthiest, most powerful country on earth and we cannot somehow get a grip on this because our government hasn’t been doing its job. Last week when Trump was asked if he’d do anything differently, you know what he said? He said, “Not much. Not much.” Really? Not much? You can’t think of anything that you might be doing differently, like maybe you shouldn’t have gotten on TV and suggested we might inject bleach to cure COVID? That’s not something you said maybe I shouldn’t have said that? Not much. Think about how hard the tourism industry has been hit right here in Orlando, right here in Florida. Joe takes this seriously. He knows the emotional toll on grandparents when they can’t see and hug their grandkids. He’s not going to screw up testing. He’s not going to call scientists idiots. He’s not going to host super spreader events at the White House, and then take it on a tour all across the country. Joe will get this pandemic under control with a plan to make testing free and widely available. He’s going to get a vaccine to every American cost-free, and he’s going to make sure our frontline heroes never have to ask other countries for the equipment that they need to keep themselves safe. His plan will guarantee paid sick leave for workers and parents affected by the pandemic. He’s going to make sure that small businesses that hold our communities together and employ millions of Americans can reopen safely. And he understands that we’re not going to rebuild the economy and put people back to work until we get this pandemic under control. It’s not that complicated. Donald Trump likes to claim he built this economy, but I just want to remind you that America created 1.5 million more jobs in the last three years of the Obama Biden administration than in the first three years of the Trump Pence administration. That’s a fact. Look it up. And that was before Trump could blame the pandemic. He, in fact, inherited the longest streak of job growth in American history. But just like everything else he inherited, he screwed it up. And the economic damage that he inflicted by botching the pandemic response means he will be the first president since Herbert Hoover to actually lose jobs, first president since Herbert Hoover, back in the thirties. That’s a long time people. That’s almost a hundred years ago. He loves to talk about Black unemployment. Look how low Black unemployment … Well, you know what? Unemployment was really high when I came in, and we brought that unemployment low, and it kept on going low, and he wants to take credit for it. Says he’s the best president for Black folks since Abe Lincoln? Man! Now his advisors are out there saying, including his son-in-law. His son-in-law says Black folks have to want to be successful. That’s the problem. Black unemployment hit almost 17% during the great recession 10 years ago, and through a lot of hard work, Joe Biden and I helped get it down, and it kept on going down, not because Trump did anything. And then this year, because they screwed up the pandemic response, it’s soared back up to above 17% here in Florida. But it doesn’t have to be that way, Florida, if you go out and vote. Si se puede. Yes we can. Listen, the only people truly better off than they were four years ago are the billionaires that got Trump’s tax cuts. In the meantime, he has not been able to manage extending relief to millions of families who can’t pay the rent right now, can’t put food on the table right now. Got no plan to reopen schools that need reopening or protecting teachers in the process. I don’t understand how it is that he cannot organize Republicans in Congress to do the right thing. And it’s not like it’s his money that we’re asking him to pay because he doesn’t pay taxes. Barely pays income tax. We know he’s got a secret Chinese bank account, so he may be paying taxes to the Chinese, but he’s not paying taxes here. First year in the White House, only paid $750 in taxes, in federal income taxes. $750. Can you imagine that? I mean, teachers pay more than that. Social workers pay more than that in taxes. Huh? Soldiers. Folks in uniform pay more in taxes than that. So how are you living large, and you’re not willing to do the right thing to make sure that we’re able to pay for quality schools for our kids, to provide veterans benefits for those who’ve earned them. Joe Biden has a plan to create 10 million good clean energy jobs right here in America. It’s part of his plan to protect Florida from climate change and secure environmental justice, and he’s going to pay for it by rolling back those tax cuts to billionaires. And the thing is, Joe doesn’t just want to get back to where we were. He finally wants to make some long overdue changes so that our economy actually makes life a little easier for everybody. The waitress trying to raise a kid on her own, the student trying to figure out how to pay for next semester’s classes, the shift worker who’s worried about maybe being laid off, the cancer survivor who’s worried that her preexisting conditions might prevent her from being able to get coverage. And speaking of healthcare, by the way, you may have noticed Republicans love saying right before an election how they’re going to protect people who have preexisting conditions. Have you noticed that? Well, you know what? Joe and I actually protected them 10 years ago with the Affordable Care Act. And you know those same Republicans who say they’re going to protect them, somehow they have tried to repeal or undermine the Affordable Care Act more than 60 times. And each time they try to repeal it, they say, “Oh, we’ve got a great replacement. It’s coming.” Everybody’s a little young here, but you guys remember Popeye? And remember that guy who always needed to borrow some money for a hamburger? He said, “Don’t worry. I’m going to be paying you back sometime soon. That’s like Republicans with healthcare. They always say, “It’s coming soon. We’re going to be paying you back with a great replacement plan.” But that two weeks has been 10 years coming now. For the last 10 years, every two weeks, they say, “We’re going to have a great healthcare plan.” You know where it is? Because I don’t. The reason they don’t have a plan is because a plan doesn’t exist. They’ve never had one. They’ve instead attacked the Affordable Care Act at every turn, driving up costs, driving up the uninsured. Now they’re trying to get the Supreme Court to take away your healthcare, right now, as quickly as they can, in the middle of a pandemic with nothing but empty promises to take its place. Think about what that would do to families right here in Florida. Florida has the highest enrollment under the Affordable Care Act of any state in America. Last week, Trump flat-out said he hopes the Supreme Court takes your health insurance away. Said it out loud. Don’t boo. Vote. And last night, he installed the Supreme Court justice who he hopes will help him do it. Don’t boo. Vote. Florida, this is serious. And Joe and Kamala will protect your healthcare. They will expand Medicare. They’ll make insurance more affordable for everybody. Because Joe knows that a president’s first job is to keep us safe from all threats, foreign, domestic, and microscopic. When the daily intelligence briefings flash warning lights about a virus, the president can’t ignore it, can’t be too lazy to read the briefing. When Russia puts bounties on the heads of our soldiers in Afghanistan, the commander in chief can’t be MIA, missing in action. Joe Biden would never call the men and women of our military suckers or losers because they were willing to sacrifice their lives on behalf of the American people. Joe Biden understands those troops are somebody’s kids, somebody’s dad, somebody’s mom, somebody’s husband, somebody’s wife’s, somebody’s father or mother. And Joe Biden understands that there is glory and goodness in being willing to sacrifice on behalf of others, something that apparently this administration just doesn’t comprehend. Our current president, he whines that 60 Minutes is too tough. You think he’s going to stand up to dictators? He thinks Leslie Stahl’s a bully. Just yesterday, just yesterday, he said that Putin of Russia, Xi of China, and Kim Jong-Un of North Korea want him to win. We know! We know because you’ve been giving them whatever they want for the last four years. Of course they want you to win. That’s not a good thing. You shouldn’t brag. That’s not a good thing. You shouldn’t brag about the fact that some of our greatest adversaries think they’d be better off with you in office. Of course they do. What does that say about you? I mean, think about that. Why are you bragging about that? Come on. And that doesn’t make any sense. Joe Biden wouldn’t coddle dictators. He’ll promote human rights around the world, including in Cuba. Joe will restore our battered standing around the world because he knows our true strength comes from setting an example that the world wants to follow. A nation that stands with democracy, not dictators, a nation that can inspire and mobilize others to overcome threats like climate change and terrorism and poverty and disease. And here’s one other thing. Joe and Kamala, when they are in office, they’re not going to have… You’re not going to have to think about them every single day. You’re not going to have to worry about what crazy things they’re going to say, what they’re going to tweet. They’re just going to be too busy doing the work. It just won’t be so exhausting. You’ll be able to go about your lives, knowing that the President’s not going to retweet conspiracy theories about secret cabals running the world or suggest, I mean, listen, our President of the United States retweeted a post that claimed that the Navy SEALs didn’t actually kill bin Laden. Think about that. And we act like, well, okay. It’s not okay. We’re not going to have a President when Joe Biden’s in office, that goes out of his way to insult people just because they don’t support him. He’ll be a President for all people, including people who didn’t vote for him because he knows that’s the job of being President. I mean, we’ve gotten so numb to what is bizarre behavior. We have a President right now who lies multiple times a day, and this is not my claim. Even Fox news sometimes says, well, what he says, isn’t really true, he didn’t mean it. It’s not normal behavior. We wouldn’t tolerate it from a coworker. We wouldn’t tolerate it from a football coach. We wouldn’t tolerate it from a high school principal. I mean, we might have to put up with it if it was a family member, but we talk about them afterwards. Even Florida man wouldn’t be doing some of this stuff. Why would we accept it from President of the United States? And you know what I mean? Sometimes it’s almost too easy to make fun of it, but it’s serious. There are consequences to his actions. If he was just on Jerry Springer or something, you’d say well… But this is the most powerful office on earth. And when people see the President doing things like that, it emboldens other people to be mean and cruel and divisive and racist and it frays the fabric of our lives. It affects the way our children see things. When we tell our children to tell the truth, and then we have the person in the highest office in the land who doesn’t seem capable of doing so, that undermines our society. It affects the way our families get along. It affects the way the world looks at America and it distracts from the truly destructive actions that his cronies are doing all across the government as we speak, actions that affect your lives. You got the Environmental Protection Agency that’s supposed to protect our air and our water. It’s run by an energy lobbyist that gives polluters free rein to dump unlimited poison into our air and our water. It’s not right. It ain’t right. The Labor Department, that’s supposed to protect workers. It’s run by a corporate lobbyist who’s declared war on workers, trying to gut protections to keep essential folks safe during a pandemic, making it easier for big corporations to steal their wages. The Interior Department, that’s supposed to protect our public lands, our wilderness, the Everglades, it’s run by an oil lobbyist who’s just fine with selling them to the highest bidder. You’ve got an education department run by a billionaire who has gutted rules designed to protect students from getting ripped off by for-profit colleges. And then is stiff arming students looking for loan relief in the middle of an economic collapse. You’ve got the person who runs Medicaid, trying not to get more people on the Medicaid so they’ve got better healthcare, but to kick more people off of Medicaid. Come one. It ain’t right. So what are you going to do about it? You got to vote. You got to vote. When Joe and Kamala are in charge, they’re not going to surround themselves with hacks and lobbyists. They’re going to surround themselves with qualified public service, who actually are serious about doing their job, who are looking out for you, for your job, your family, your health, your communities, your planet, and that more than anything is what separates them from their opponents. They actually care about you. They actually care about every American and they’re going to be fighting on your behalf every single day. They’re not going to get everything right every time. They’re not going to solve every problem right away, but they’re going to be working on it every single day to see how can I make sure this little brand new baby right here is inheriting a better world. That’s what they care about. I will say that I miss kissing babies during pandemic. I can’t do it, but I look at that a little bundle right there, brand new. It’s got the new baby smell. Congratulations. But Joe and Kamala, they care deeply about people and they care about our democracy. They believe that in a democracy, the right to vote is sacred. We shouldn’t be making people wait in line for hours. We should be making it easier for everybody to vote, not harder. They believe that no one, especially the President, is above the law. They understand that protest isn’t un-American. This country was founded on protesting against injustice. And we don’t threaten to throw our political opponents in jail just because we disagree with them. That’s what happens in dictatorship. That doesn’t happen in the United States of America. Joe and Kamala understand that our ability to work together to solve big problems like the pandemic depends on more than just photo ops. It depends on applying facts and logic and science and not making things up, not flooding the internet with misinformation. These should not be Republican or Democratic values. They’re what we grew up learning from our parents and grandparents. They’re not white or black or Hispanic or Asian or Native American values, they’re supposed to be American values. And we have to reclaim them right now. And how are we going to do that? By voting. We’ve got to turn out like never before Orlando. We have to leave no doubt. We can’t be complacent. We were complacent last time. Folks got a little lazy. Folks took things for granted. And look what happened. Not this time, not in this election. I understand there’s some Americans who get frustrated by government. They feel like, oh, it doesn’t make enough of a difference. My vote won’t make a difference. Listen, the government’s not perfect, it’s not going to solve every problem, but a good government can make things better. Things were better when I left office, than when I started. They weren’t perfect, but they were better. A President shouldn’t make things worse. A President by himself can’t solve every challenge facing our economy. But if we elect a President who cares and we elect a House and a Senate and a State House and a State Senate that are focused on working people and getting you the help you need, it can make a difference. A President by himself can’t eliminate all racial bias in our criminal justice system. But if we elect District Attorneys and State’s Attorneys and Sheriffs and Police Chiefs focused on equality and justice, it can make things better. And that’s what voting is about. Not making things perfect, but making them better. It’s about putting us on track so that a generation from now we can look back and say, hey, things started getting better. It’s about using the power we have and pulling it together to make sure that we have a government that’s more concerned, more responsive, more focused on you. And you know what? When I hear people say, well, I don’t know, I voted last time. Things didn’t change as much as I thought. Listen, we’ve never come close to seeing what it would be like if everybody voted. In 2008, that was the highest voting rate in modern presidential history. You know what? We only got to 61%. That means 39% of the folks didn’t vote who were eligible to vote. The country would be transformed. Imagine. Imagine January 20th and we swear in a president and a vice-president who have a plan to deal with this pandemic effectively, who believe in science, who have a plan to protect this planet for our children, who care about working Americans, who have a plan to help you start getting ahead, who believe in racial equality, who are willing to do the work to bring us closer to the ideal that no matter what you look like, where you come from, who you love, how much money you got, you can make it here in America. You’ll be treated with respect, and dignity and justice here in America. Imagine a president when Puerto Rico gets hit by a hurricane, doesn’t respond just by throwing paper towels, but says, those are Americans and we’ve got to make sure that we get in the help they need as quickly as possible. That’s what you should expect from a president. And if you’re not getting that, then you have to go out there and vote to make it happen. All of that is possible. All of that is within our reach. For all the times these past four years when we’ve seen our worst impulses revealed, the good news is we’ve also seen our best impulses revealed. We’ve seen folks of every age and background pack city centers and town squares so that families wouldn’t be separated. I’ve got a friend, Jose Andress, great restaurateur, took it upon himself, went down to Puerto Rico after the hurricane, organized thousands of meals just on his own because he was seeing that the response wasn’t quick enough. Just did it on his own. That is America. We saw people out on the streets saying, we’re not going to have our classrooms shut up anymore. We’ve seen people activated to make sure our kids don’t grow up on an uninhabitable planet. We’ve seen healthcare workers, so many of them all across the country, risk their lives every single day just to save somebody else’s loved ones. We’ve seen people contribute and volunteer to neighbors that have been hit hard. We’ve seen Americans of all races joining together to declare in the face of injustice and brutality at the hands of the state that black lives matter no more, but no less, for that no child in this country should feel the continuing sting of racism. That’s true in Orlando, it’s true in Florida, it’s true all across this country. America is a good and decent place, but we’ve just seen so much noise, and nonsense and distortion, and sometimes it’s hard for us to remember. But Orlando, I’m asking you to remember what this country can be, what it should be, what it must be. I’m asking you to believe in Joe’s ability to lead this country out of these dark times, to help us build it back better. Don’t abandon those who are hurting right now. We can’t abandon the kids who aren’t getting the education they need right now. We can’t abandon all those young people who are out on the streets who inspires. We’ve got to channel their activism into action. We can’t just dream for a better future, we got to fight for a better future. We got to out hustle the other side. We’ve got to vote like never before and leave no doubt. So make a plan, vote as early as you can, grab your friends and your family, get them to vote all the way up and down the ticket. And if we pour all our efforts into this final week, if we vote like never before, then we will elect Joe Biden President of the United States. We’ll elect Kamala Harris Vice President of the United States. We will establish once again what this country stands for, what our values are, who we are as a people. Let’s get to work, Florida. Let’s bring it home. I love you, Orlando. I love you Florida. Honk if you’re fired up. Honk if you’re ready to go. Are you fired up? Are you ready to go? I’m fired up. Let’s go do this thing. Let’s bring it home. Thank you."
"135","10-28-20"," Good afternoon, everyone. Let me say to the press assembled, I’m going to make a short statement here, and then I’m going over to vote with my wife and then I’ll be happy to take your questions after I vote. I just completed in here another public health briefing with my team of public health experts. We looked at the latest reported data on how it indicates that we’re on an upward slope of a bigger wave of confirmed infections than anything we experienced to date. We talked about what actions would be needed to turn this around and how it will be made worse by this administration’s declaration of surrender to the virus. And we discussed again, the vital importance of wearing masks, of protecting yourself, protecting your neighbor, and to save around a 100,000 lives in the months ahead between now and just after the first of the year. This is not political, it’s patriotic. Wearing a mask, wear one, period. We focused on the way this virus is hitting communities of color much harder, particularly black, Latino and Native American communities. We’re seeing race-based disparities across the aspects of this virus, higher infection rates, but lower access to testing and harder time quarantining safely because of their financial circumstances. Lower access to quality treatment, when they are infected and tragically higher mortality rates. One in 1,000 black Americans have died from this virus. This is a staggering statistic and 57% of black adults, 46% of Latino adults know someone who has died or been hospitalized from disease. Folks, we’ve lost more than 220,000 lives to this virus already. But this administration has just given up. Over the weekend, the White House, chief of staff Mark Meadows, went on television and admitted that they’ve waived the white flag and declared surrender. He said quote, “We’re not going to control the pandemic.” End of quote. The American people deserve so much better than this. Just look at what happened last night in Omaha, after the Trump rally ended. Hundreds of people, including older Americans and children were stranded in sub-zero freezing temperatures for hours. Several folks ended up in the hospital. It’s an image that captures President Trump’s whole approach to this crisis. He takes a lot of big pronouncements and he makes a lot of big pronouncements, but they don’t hold up. He gets his photo op and then he gets out. He leaves everyone else to suffer the consequences of his failure to make a responsible plan. It seems like he just doesn’t care much about it. And the longer he’s in charge, the more reckless he gets, it’s enough. It’s time to change. Meanwhile, yesterday, the White House science office and this stunned me, put out a statement listing ending the COVID-19 pandemic as a top accomplishment of President Trump’s first term. Top accomplishment of Trump’s first term. At the very moment when infection rates are going up in almost every state in our union, the refusal of the Trump administration to recognize the reality we’re living through at a time when almost a 1,000 Americans a day are dying. Every single day is an insult to every single person suffering from COVID-19 and every family who’s lost a loved one. There’s nothing more personal. There’s nothing more personal to an American family than their health care and the health care of their loved ones. I know all too well what it feels like to have your heart ripped out, losing a loved one too soon. To sit in the hospital bedside and feel like there’s a black hole in the middle of your chest, knowing there’s not much you can do. I and many of you know what it feels like to watch a beloved person die, why they’re dying of cancer or some other disease without having to wonder about whether you’re can pay for the medical bills or what would happen if God forbid the insurance companies were able to come in and say, ” We’re not going to cover the treatment.” And yet today, President Trump is on a single-minded crusade to strip Americans of their health care. That would only create another enormous crisis in the public health system. In two short weeks, exactly one week after the election, the Trump administration will make its case, asking the Supreme Court to strike down the Affordable Care Act quote, “In its entirety.” In its entirety. Let me say that again. They’re arguing that the entire law must fall, which would strip 20 million Americans have their health insurance overnight, rip away protections for pre-existing conditions for more than 100 million people in the middle of an upswing of a pandemic, the upswing. Look, just this week on 60 Minutes, we heard what Trump told Lesley Stahl about the upcoming Supreme Court case on the Affordable Care Act. And I quote, “I hope that they end it’ll be so good if they end it.” End of quote. There is no question. There’s no question. That’s why President Trump nominated Justice Barrett to the court. And that’s why the Republicans jammed her through confirmation in the middle of the election. Republicans have tried and tried and tried since the Affordable Care Act was passed to overturn it. And every single time they failed. President Trump has tried everything he can on his own to sabotage the law. So now through what I’d characterize as a craving abusive of political power. They’ve added to the Court of Justice who criticized Chief Justice, Roberts’ previous decision to uphold the Affordable Care Act in hopes that they can destroy the Affordable Care Act once and for all through the courts. No matter how many Americans they hurt in the process. So let’s remember exactly what’s at stake in this election. If you have diabetes, asthma, cancer, or even complications from COVID-19, you’re going to lose the protection this law provides. Insurers will once more be able to jack-up your premiums or deny your coverage. Women could again be charged more for their health care just because they’re women and children will no longer be able to stay in their parents’ insurance policies until age 26. On top of all that, overturning the ACA could mean that people have to pay to get COVID-19 vaccine once it’s available. That’s right. That’s right. The law that says insurers are required to cover vaccines for free is the Affordable Care Act. And he’s striking that down, attempting to. Unlike Donald Trump, I believe health care isn’t a privilege, it’s a right that everyone have access to it? This country can’t afford four more years of a president who thinks he’s only responsible for the wellbeing of the people who voted for him. We can’t afford four more years of a president who instead of fighting the virus, attacks doctors. I can’t get over the guy. He attacked doctors claiming their over-reporting COVID cases because they want to make more money. Doctors are over-reporting cases because they want to make money. Our doctors and nurses and our frontline health care workers are putting themselves at enormous risk every day. More than a 1,000 of them have already died in attempt to beat back this pandemic and save lives. They deserve to be treated with respect by their president. We can’t afford four more years of a president who’d rather spend his time desperately trying to strip people of their health care, and even once bothered to put forward a health care plan on his own. We can’t afford four more years of Donald Trump. And the good news is we have a chance to turn this around by voting. We have six more days left in this election and the American people have it in their hands to put this country in a vastly different path. This is my commitment to you. I’ll protect and build on the Affordable Care Act, so that you can keep your private insurance or choose a Medicare like option. You can make it stronger. I’m going to make it stronger with your help to lower premiums and deductibles. And out-of-pocket expenses. We’ll bring down drug prices, but almost two thirds by taking steps such as allowing Medicare to negotiate with the pharmaceutical companies who are making billions of dollars, making the price lower. When they negotiate, Medicare says, “We’re only going to pay you X amount for the following medicines.” That will lower prices drastically making it available to everyone. We’re going to make sure every American has access to free COVID-19 vaccine. This isn’t beyond our capacity. Now, if we come together, we can stand together. If we stand together as the United States, the United States, Democrats, Republicans and independents. We can transcend all divisions and show what’s possible. There’s nothing beyond our capacity. There’s no limit to America’s future. And if I’m elected president, as I said yesterday in Warm Springs, Georgia. I’ll be a president who is not in it for himself, but for others. A president of doesn’t divide us, but unites us. A president who appeals not to the worst in us, but to the best in us and a president who looks not to settle scores, but to find solutions. A president guided not by wishful thinking, but by science, reason and facts. Even if I win, it’s going to take a lot of hard work to end this pandemic. I’m not running on the false promise of being able to end this pandemic by flipping a switch. But what I can promise you is this, we will start on day one doing the right things. We’ll let science drive our decisions. We will deal honestly with the American people and we will never, ever, ever quit. That’s how we’ll shut down this virus. So we can get back to our lives, a lot more quickly than the pace we’re going at now. I’m going to fight to protect your health care, I promise you. Just like I fight for my own family. We can do this. I promise you, and I’m going to go do what I hope all of you do. I’m going to walk out of this building and I’m going to go vote. I’m going to go vote. There’s a lot of people on that ballot, not just me, but the down-ballot as well, that are going to change things for us. Make it better. So may God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. Thank you."
"136","10-29-20"," Thank you all so much for being here. I tell you what, I do miss the opportunity to just wander in and shake hands with all of you. But we decided a while ago that we were going to try to be responsible and not be… I won’t get into it, but just be responsible. And so thank you for wearing your mask and thank you for the social distancing. And thank you for being here. Ladies and gentlemen, Manny and Patricia, I want to thank you so much for being here today, for sharing your memory of Joaquin. Folks, I know what it means to lose a child and many of you do as well. And no matter how often, no matter how long ago it occurred, every time you stand up and you want to talk about your son or daughter that you lost, it brings back the memories as if it happened 10 minutes ago. It takes a lot of courage to stand up and talk. And you feel like you have a black hole’s been ripped in the middle of your chest and you’re being sucked into it. But through your courage and the courage of the Parkland families, like my friend Corey Hixon and his mom Debbie and brother Tom who are here today and other students who led the march for our lives to take on the NRA and win. We’re going to help us all turn tragedy into purpose. I want to thank you for your bravery, thank you for your resolve. I want to thank all the speakers that went ahead of me, including the NBA stars joining us today. I tell you what, the Miami Heat. You ever heard of the Miami Heat, I guess? Well, I’m allowed to say nice things about the Miami Heat even though I come from Sixers country. I apologize for that. But I want to tell you, they made it to the finals full of grit and toughness. And Karl-Anthony Towns, Karl, he knows what it’s like to deal with this coronavirus. Karl and his dad lost their mom and wife back in April. And a lot of these families didn’t have to lose anybody. And, thank you very much for being here. As well as my friends, Congressman Ted Deutch, thank you for the passport, Ted, into your district. I appreciate it. And my friend, Debbie Wasserman Schultz. We got to send the votes back to the House of Representatives. We’re going to increase the numbers in the House of Representatives. Five days left folks. Millions of Americans are already voting, millions more are going to vote by the end of this week. And I believe when you use your power, the power to vote, you’re going to change the course of this country for generations to come, at home and abroad. This election is the most important one you’ve ever voted in. Whether it’s your first or tenth. Ladies and gentlemen, the heart and soul of this country is at stake right here in Florida. It’s up to you. You hold the key. If Florida goes blue, it’s over. It’s over. Look, the press has heard me say this a long time, Wall Street and CEOs didn’t build this country. People standing out here in your automobiles, you are the ones that built this country. The middle class built this country, and you just built the middle class. You’re the ones who are going to save the country now that you built it. In these final days, keep that sense of empowerment with you. That sense of optimism of what we can do, what we will overcome. I’ve never been more optimistic about America or the American people that am today. And on November the third, we’re going to unite this country and show the world who we really are. I know it’s hard. All these past few months have been so much pain, so much suffering. So much loss. Over 225,000 dead Americans because of the negligence and the consequence of COVID. More than 16,000 here in Florida alone. As I said in April, Karl-Anthony, he lost his mom. Millions of people out there are out of work, on the edge, can’t see the light at the end of the tunnel and Donald Trump has given up. Over the weekend, his White House chief of staff said, and I quote, “We’re not going to control this pandemic.” In the debate last week with Donald Trump, he said, “We’re rounding the corner. It’s going away. We’re learning how to live with it.” No, he expects us to learn how to die with it. That’s what I told him. He’s doing nothing. We’re learning to die with it and Donald Trump has waved the white flag, abandoned our families and surrendered to the virus. But the American people don’t give up. We don’t give in and we surely don’t cower and nor will I under any circumstance. President Trump’s super spreader events that he’s spreading more virus around the country. And here in Florida today, he’s spreading division in addition, division and discord. We need a president who is going to bring us together, not pull us apart. I’ll put in place a plan to deal with this pandemic responsibly. I’ve already done it and bring this country together around testing and tracing and masking. It’s estimated by the leading doctors in America, including Trump’s own director of the CDC and Dr. Fauci, they called for a mask mandate last week. If we just wore a mask over the next few months, we could save 100,000 projected deaths. 100,000 lives. We’re expected to lose another 200,000 people between now and the end of this year if we do nothing. This is not a political statement, it’s a patriotic duty for God’s sake. But still Trump refused to listen to the science. And we shouldn’t be politicizing the race for a vaccine either, we should be planning it safe and equitable and free distribution. Providing the funding for PPE, the mask and everything we need to protect ourselves. Setting a national standard for schools and businesses to reopen. Bringing together Republicans and Democrats to deliver the economic relief that’s already been passed in the House of Representatives for working families, the young employed, for schools, for businesses. Allowing you to stay in your home if you don’t have the money for rent. Allowing you to stay in your home. 20 million people are on the cliff of losing their home for next month’s mortgage payment. I’ve said it before, I’m not going to shut down the economy. I’m not going to shut down the country, but I’m going to shut down the virus. Look, when Barack and I left office, we left Donald Trump a strong economy, stronger than the one he handled. And just like everything else he inherited, he blew it. Now he’s squandering that economy like he squandered everything else. But we can build back and we can build back better with an economy that begins to reward work, not wealth. We can do without raising taxes on a single person making less than 400,000 bucks a year. I promise you that. My word. But if you make $400,000 and above, you’re going to start paying your fair share. Ladies and gentlemen, all we’re going to ask is the wealthiest among us and the major corporations just began to pay their fair share. 91 of the Fortune 500 companies pay zero in taxes after making billions of dollars. They have to pay a minimum tax. And that’s a fact. $750. Remember what he said when that was raised a while ago, how he only pays… He said, “Because I’m smart. I know how to game the system.” He games the system at your expense. He games the system at the expense of hardworking American people. We’re going to deliver tax relief for working families in the middle class. We’re going to help people buy their first home, pay for their healthcare premiums. And for childcare, we’re going to care for the aging and loved one. We’re going to make sure you can wipe out your college debt as well. We give more help to race horses than we do college students. Look, Trump got the Supreme Court justice passed and he did it for one reason to try to destroy the Affordable Care Act. Again, since he got an office he’s been trying to, and the Republican and have been trying to multiple times, try to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. If they get their way this time, 100 million Americans will lose their protection for preexisting conditions. If you have asthma, diabetes, any pre-existing condition, they can charge you so much you can’t afford anything. Including 8.4 million Floridians who have pre-existing conditions are now covered. Complications with COVID, heart scarring, lung scarring, heart disease, they’re going to become preexisting conditions. Allowing insurers to jack up your premiums, deny your coverage. And most people don’t remember it particularly the young people, women will once again be able to charged more for healthcare just because they’re a woman. Donald Trump thinks healthcare is a privilege, I think it’s a right of every American. If you all get out and vote, we’ll not only restore Obamacare, we’re going to strengthen it and build on it. The Biden plan is going to make sure if you have private insurance, you want to keep it, you can keep it. But you also have an option under my plan. To have a Medicare like option, a public option. We’re going to increase subsidies for lower premiums and deductibles, out of pocket spending. And we are going to reduce prescription drug crisis, the experts acknowledged, by 60%. Folks, we’re going to make sure we keep preconditions and protections for people with those conditions. We’re going to protect social security, Medicare. Meanwhile, the social security actuary says the plan that Trump says he wants to institute if he’s reelected would bankrupt security by the year 2023. Ladies and gentlemen, people paid that for their entire careers. Go home and tell that to your parents and grandparents. It will not happen on Biden’s watch. Folks, we need to vote for the legacy of Ruth Bader Ginsburg. She was proof that courage, conviction, and moral clarity can change the world without being vicious and mean. She and Justice Scalia disagreed in everything, but they were friends. They disagreed. We got to get back to that. Politics has become so ugly and mean and disruptive, but we can be the voices for justice in her name. We have to make our voices heard. You have to vote. You have to vote because while Donald Trump fails to contain white supremacy, we can deliver on racial justice. Donald Trump, he doesn’t believe there’s any such thing as systemic racism as a problem. He won’t even say black lives matter. Well, you know what I know, black lives do matter and so do others. That’s why this season of protest is broken out all across the nation. Let me make it clear, protesting is not burning, it’s not looting, it’s not violence and must never be tolerated and it won’t. But these protestors are a cry for justice from communities that have long, long had the knee of injustice on their neck. The names George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, Jacob Blake, [inaudible 00:13:45] They’re not soon going to be forgotten, not by me, not by us and not by this country. We’re going to inspire a new wave of justice in America, but true justice is also about economic justice, justice and education, housing, access to capital, good paying jobs. And by the way, it was long overdue time the minimum wage in America is $15 an hour. And by the way, my economic plan has been analyzed by the guys on Wall Street. You know what they say? They say my plan will create 18.6 million good paying jobs. 7 million more than he’s going to be able to create if he got elected and a trillion dollars more in economic growth. What he’s forgotten, when you all do better, everybody does better, everybody does better. It’s not a zero sum game, it’s about financial stability and giving families of color a real shot to own a home, to start a business, to send a child to college debt free. So they can build the wealth, pass on opportunity down through generations. Is that how every white family that came from my background got it? They were able to get a house and build an equity, pass it on and grow it. That’s what we’re going to do. But we have to vote to ensure the full promise of this country. We have to vote for new Cuba policy as well. This administration approach isn’t working. Cuba’s no closer to freedom and democracy today than it was four years ago. In fact, there are more political prisoners and secret police are as brutal as ever. And Russia once again is a major presence in Havana. So much for his policy. President Trump can’t advance democracy and human rights for the Cuban people or the Venezuela people for that matter when he has embraced so many autocrats around the world. Started with Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un of North Korea. Trump is the worst possible standard bearer for democracy in places like Cuba, Venezuela, North Korea. For my entire career, I’ve stood for democracy and human rights. For freedom of the press, assembly, freedom of religion and against dictators, whether they’re left or right. Folks, it unconscionable that the Trump administration says it cares so much are deporting hundreds of Cubans and Venezuelans back to their dictatorships. Trump loves to talk, but he doesn’t care about Cuban and Venezuelan people. He won’t even grant temporary protective status for Venezuelans fleeing the oppressive regime of Maduro who I’ve met with and he’s a thug. Folks, I will, but we have to vote. And finally, we have to vote to meet the challenge of the climate crisis. This guy doesn’t understand much of anything. You’ve all seen the impact more than most. Devastating hurricanes that lay waste to whole communities. Economic toll is astounding. It grows every year and the human toll was worse. Lost lives, lost homes, small businesses shattered. First responders put at risk. When you talk about global warming, Donald Trump thinks hoax. Well, then he says we shouldn’t… By the way, do you know? This is a guy who is the stable genius. Remember, he’s the guy that said our problem with the Revolutionary War, we didn’t have enough airports. God’s truth. He’s also the guy when he talked about how many bad hurricanes are coming across the warm waters in the Atlantic from Africa, he said, “Maybe we should nuke them.” And also by the way, windmills cause cancer according to him. Look, what’s this guy talking about? But we know that we got to do something about it. Combating climate change means jobs. We can unleash the American ingenuity and manufacturing to build a stronger, more climate resistant nation, creating millions of new high paying jobs. And we can change the path we’re on, but we’ve got to act now. This country can’t afford to wait four more years of Donald Trump’s denial, who thinks the only responsible to the people who voted for him. I don’t see the presidency that way. I don’t see the presidency that way. In 2008 and 2012, Florida placed their trust in me at Barack and each day we’re in office, we worked as hard for you and the entire country as we did not red states, blue states, it was always the United States of America. Folks, I was reminded of that earlier this month when I visited the sacred grounds of Gettysburg. Abraham Lincoln taught us that we need to unite our nation, that a house divided cannot stand. And I was reminded of it earlier this week when I went to Warm Springs, Georgia. Reflecting on FDR taught us about the need to heal the nation. I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I’ll govern as an American president to unite and to heal. I’ll work as hard for those who didn’t support me as those who do. That’s the job of the president. A duty of caring, caring for everyone. And you to have a sacred duty, if I may say, and that’s to vote. It matters. Florida matters. In these final days stay empowered, stay optimistic, stay united. Make a plan and vote and help get out to vote. Visit iwillvote.com/fl. Return your ballot today if you haven’t done it so far, or you can get to vote early in person through November 1st. But you’ve got to get out and vote and make sure everyone you know votes as well. Folks, there’s nothing we cannot do from beating the NRA to restoring rationality and the climate. I’ll never forget what President Kennedy said when he promised to send us to the moon in his speech. He said, “We’re doing it because we refuse to postpone.” That’s what Americans do, refuse to postpone what is needed. I refuse to postpone my work america must do now. There’s nothing, this is not hyperbolely, there is nothing beyond the capacity of United States of America. There’s no limit to America’s future. We’re the only country in every crisis we’ve inherited, we’ve come out of it stronger than we went in it, because this is United States of America. And the only thing that can tear us apart is America itself. A president like Trump who appeals to our fears, president who pours gasoline in every flame he can find. Person who knows the only way he can win is if he divides us on race, nationality, national origin, gender. Look, everybody knows who Donald Trump is, we got to show them who we are. Article today in the press. I want to read a quote from. It says, “Never before in modern presidential politics has a candidate been so reliant on wide-scale efforts to depress the vote than Trump.” He knows if you vote, he can’t win. Why do you think they’re spending so much time keeping black folks and brown folks and poor folks from being able to vote? Why making it so hard? Because he knows when America votes, they reject people like him. We choose hope over fear. We choose unity over division and we choose science over fiction. And yes, we choose truth over lies. So folks, it’s time to stand up, take back our democracy. We can do this. We can be better than what we’ve been. We can be who we are at our best. As I said, the United States of America. There’s nothing beyond our capacity. I promise you. I promise you. And I promise you if you elect me, when I’m wrong I’ll acknowledge it. I’ll take responsibility, but I tell you what, I’m going to unite this country and we’re going to move like we haven’t in a long time. God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."
"137","10-30-20"," Hello. Good afternoon, Fort Worth. It is so wonderful. My name’s Rebecca Acuna. I’m the Texas State Director for the Biden campaign. And like you, I have been working every day to flip this state and elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. By now, we all know that Texas is a battleground state. It is. It’s why today on the last day of early vote and just four days before the election, Senator Kamala Harris is right here in Fort Worth. We know that this election is about the battle to restore the soul of the nation. We know that this is about a better future and an America that works for all of us. Now I’m going to share something very personal with you. Some of those videos that you all saw today, and I saw a photo of her father, an immigrant from Jamaica and her mother, an immigrant from India. And I was moved because what I saw was an immigrant family like mine. You see, my father, [inaudible 00:02:06] and my mother Norma came to the US from Mexico, seeking a better life for our family when I was just six years old. And my mother, she had these flashcards with photos on one side, and she would use them to teach us English, even though she herself could not speak it yet. And when the math homework got a little hard, my dad would go to the library and check out books to help us do our math homework. They worked hard to make sure my sister and I lived our American dream. My mother, a waitress at Denny’s who after her shift would bake dessert to make a little more money, and my father who was a manager at Mexican food restaurant, both of them spending a lifetime on their feet. And aside from the financial hardships, like many working families face, we were also dealing with a complex immigration system. If you’re wondering, yes, we were undocumented. Back then, the Obama Biden relief for immigrant children for dreamers known as DACA didn’t yet exist, leaving my sister and me in limbo. And today, many, many, many, many chapters later, this dreamer stands before you as a proud American citizen who just this morning cast my first vote in a presidential election and I did so as the state director for the Biden Harris campaign. And there could be no better first because Kamala Harris embodies the hopes, the dreams and aspirations of all of us. Her story says to the world that in America, anything is possible. That it is the place where the kid of an immigrant can rise to the US Senate into the White House in just one generation. She has spent her life fighting for justice, and now she and Joe Biden need our help. Today, Texas, is the last day of early voting. Election day is right around the corner. So Texas, you vote. You vote because generations before us fought for this fight. You vote for the families worried that their health coverage will get taken away. You vote for all of the Texans who have lost a loved one to COVID-19. You vote for the mothers and fathers who lost their jobs in this pandemic. You vote for the disenfranchised. And you vote for all those who still can’t. Today I voted for all the dreamers who still can’t because when future generations, they ask us, and they’re going to ask us what it was like to elect the first woman of color as vice president of the United States, and we will say, “Yes, I was there. I stood up and I was counted.” Without further delay, I am so honored to introduce the next President of the United States, Senator Kamala Harris. What’s up Fort Worth? Can we please hear it for Rebecca Acuna? She is phenomenal. When I look at Rebecca, I know our future is bright. I know our future as a country is bright. She is extraordinary. She has been a leader in this campaign. She is someone who walks and talks with confidence, having life experiences and knowing when she walks in that room, yes, sister. Sometimes we may be the only one that looks like us walking in that room, having had the experiences that we’ve had, but the thing we all know is we never walk in those rooms alone. We are all in that room together. So proud of you. How’s everybody doing? It’s so good to see, Texas. Bernice, it is so good to see you. I want to first acknowledge all the leaders. Everybody here is the leader. Bishop [Spheres 00:00:07:47]. Where is Bishop Spheres? There? Hello, Bishop. Thank you for welcoming us in such a warm way. Thank you, Bishop. DeDe McGuire, I talked to her earlier. Where is she? Hi DeDe. Thank you. Thank you for your show and your voice. Fred Hayman and Marvin Sapp, where are they? Oh my God. I felt like that was a good revival. There we are. Thank you both for just the gift that you have and that you keep sharing and giving. Thank you. Eddie Bernice Johnson, the great Congresswoman. And Mark Veasey, We are on his home turf. Thank you for letting me be here. And Colin Allred, where is he? And Colin Allred. And we are all colleagues in the United States Congress. We are also members of the Congressional Black Caucus. And I will tell you Texas, you are so well-represented in the United States Congress with these three. And they’re always in these rooms. And you know, I see them in the rooms where the cameras are and where the cameras are not, and they are always fighting for the people of Texas. They are leaders for Texas and they are national leaders and they represent the voice of all people so well. So thank you all. Thank you. Thank you. So listen, today is the last day of early voting in Texas and you all have been doing your thing. What did I hear? Was it nine million people have voted so far? Early voting in Texas nine million. Now we know this is no time to let up on the pedal though, right? So I know people sent me pictures of standing in line at midnight this morning, I guess last night, waiting to vote. There was a line. People are committed. And so today is the last day of early voting in Texas. Their powerful voice is represented in this election through their vote, because there is so much at stake and so many reasons to vote. Just think about it. Right now in our country, we are in the middle of at least four obvious crises, right? There’s the crisis that is a public health crisis that has caused over 215 … I think now over 220,000 people to die in just the last several months. The tragedy of it is so many, because of the nature of this pandemic, spent their last hours on earth without even the benefit of holding the hand and touching someone they love, maybe communicating through a video, but without the warmth of the family around them. Eight and a half million, almost nine million people have contracted this virus with untold long-term consequences. Doctors are talking about things like lung scarring. It will, by the way, at this point, most likely qualify as a pre-existing condition, which means on top of the numbers that we know, the disproportionate numbers in terms of African Americans and Latinos for high blood pressure and diabetes, we’re now looking at this. Let’s look at the racial disparities in this virus. African Americans and Latinos are three times as likely to contract the disease and twice as likely to die from it. The tragedy of the loss of human life, I’ve been referring to this as one of the greatest mass casualty events that we’ve experienced since World War II. The tragedy of it, and here’s why I bring it up, guys. It didn’t have to be this bad. It didn’t have to be this bad. Just think about it. Thanks to a fellow by the name of Bob Woodward, we know about the seriousness of this virus. Informed that it is five times as likely to kill people as the flu, was informed that it would hurt people of every age. Was informed that it is airborne, and he sat on that information. He called it a hoax. He suggested that on his ledger of … the other side of his … ledger if you don’t. Can you imagine, as parents, as teachers, as small business owners, what you … President of the United States sat down, what you might’ve done to prepare, knowing that even before this pandemic, far too many Americans were working two and three jobs to try and pay their rent and put food on the table. By the way, and Joe Biden in my America, nobody should work more than one job to have to put food on the table and pay the rent. But what folks might’ve done to prepare, small business owners, workers, because you see, still, even before this pandemic, which has been highlighted, we have a country that has not made it a national priority for working people to have paid sick leave and paid family leave. That will change in a Biden and Harris administration. But what people … Their children are going to miss so much of these critical days … their education. What people might’ve done to prepare, to just simply buy a couple of extra rolls of toilet paper. We’re in the midst of a public health pandemic. You also have a situation where we have a President who, while we are seeing spikes around our country, talking about we’ve turned the corner, continuing to mislead the American people. So there are clear choices in this election. Barack Obama created Obamacare, which brought health care to over 20 million people and protected people with preexisting conditions and understood that healthcare and access to healthcare should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it, Joe Biden, who says we will expand on the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare. We will extend protections. We will bring down the cost of prescription drugs. We will bring down the cost of the premiums. We will lower Medicare eligibility to age 60, expand healthcare, understanding the body doesn’t just start from the neck down. It includes the neck up, and we need to expand mental healthcare. Clear choices, because you see, on the other hand, you have Donald Trump, who together with his boy Bill Barr are in the United States Supreme Court right now, trying to sue to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which, again, brought healthcare to so many people. Here in Texas, we’re looking at 10 million Texans who have preexisting conditions. If they are successful with that lawsuit, all of the folks who have … Over 20 million people are likely to lose their protections, and we now have almost nine million people who have new preexisting conditions called COVID. There are clear choices in this election. Because of this pandemic, the worsening of the wealth gap in America has been such that over 30 million people in just the last several months had to file for unemployment insurance. We are seeing numbers that tell us one in five mothers who has a child under the age of 12 is describing her children as being hungry. Here in Texas, we’re looking at the numbers that tell us that one in eight households is describing their household as having been hungry. We’re in the middle of a hunger crisis in America. They’re not covering it enough. We’re in the middle of a hunger crisis. Here in Texas, one in six households has described not being able to pay their rent or being concerned that they cannot pay their rent next month. Here in Texas, one in four small businesses has gone out of business, and let’s be clear. Across America, almost 50% of the workforce either owns a small business or runs a small business. We are looking at an economic devastation that is being compared to the Great Depression. On the one hand, you have Joe Biden, who says, ” You want to ask me about the economy and how it’s doing? Then you need to tell me how working people are doing. How are families doing in America?”, which is why Joe Biden is committed to not raising taxes ever on anyone making less than $400,000 a year, lowering middle class taxes, also making sure that no working family pays more than 7% of your income in childcare, making sure there’s a $15,000 tax credit for first-time home buyers, understanding that is the way that we have intergenerational wealth in America, is to allow people to own a home. That’s how Joe Biden thinks of the economy. On the other hand, you have Donald Trump, who when asked, “How’s the economy doing?,” he will ask, ” Well, how’s the stock market doing?” He asks, “How are rich people doing?” As one of his first orders of business, he passed a tax code benefitting the top 1% and the biggest corporations in America. Well, let me tell you, Joe Biden and I, if we win, are about to get rid of that and invest that money in working people in America, invest that money in building back up our infrastructure, our roads, and our bridges and renewable energy, creating millions of jobs, investing that money in making sure that our students coming from families that make less than $125,000 go to public universities tuition-free, including HBCUs, including private HBCUs, ensuring that our students, when they graduate, if they take on a life of service and public service in a job that pays less than $125, 000, that their debt will be erased. … $125,000 that their debt will be erased. That’s how we’ll invest that money, in the American people. Crises. We are facing a long overdue reckoning on the issue of racial injustice in America. And there are clear choices. On the one hand, you have Joe Biden, who is a student of American history and has the courage to speak the phrase Black Lives Matter. A Joe Biden who understands that we need to deal with these racial disparities, we need to acknowledge them, difficult though they may be to think about much less talk about. We need to address it in terms of what we’re doing around healthcare. We need to address it in terms of the racial wealth gap. We need to address it in terms of the gaps in our education system. Joe Biden says, “Let’s deal with it by putting $150 billion into low interest loans for minority businesses, Black and brown businesses which tend to be the economic lifeblood of the community. Joe Biden says, “Let’s deal with it in terms of a criminal justice system that must be held accountable for those disparities. Let’s get rid of mandatory minimums. Let us decriminalize marijuana and expunge the record of the people who have been convicted for marijuana offenses. Let’s shut down the private prisons. Let’s get rid of cash bail, understanding people are sitting in jail for weeks, months, and years, simply because they can’t afford to get out, which makes it an economic justice issue as much as it is a criminal justice issue. And on the other hand, you have Donald Trump, who on a debate stage two debates ago, refused to condemn white supremacists. And then doubled down and said they should stand back and stand by. Donald Trump. Because you got to understand this is a pattern. Who, when running for office and even before, had the gall to question and challenge the legitimacy of America’s first Black president. The commander in chief of the United States who, when asked about the tragedy in Charlottesville, where peaceful protesters were protesting racial injustice and a young woman was killed, and then on the other side there were Neo-Nazis wearing swastikas, carrying tiki torches, hurling racial and anti-Semitic epithets. The commander in chief said there were fine people on both sides. A president of the United States who has called Mexicans rapists and criminals, who as his first order of business instituted a Muslim ban. America, we deserve better. That does not reflect who we are as our values and priorities as a nation that knows we are our strongest when we are unified, knows that we have so much more in common, regardless of where you live, the race, your ethnicity, the language your grandmother speaks. We know we have so much more in common. And we have a choice in this election to elect a Joe Biden who says we are, as a first order of priority, going to unify our country and bring us back together as a nation who values the importance of giving each other respect and dignity. Clear choices in this election. Not to mention the other crisis we are facing, which is the climate crisis. Texas, you know that well. You look at what’s going on around our country. Up and down the west coast, you know I’m from California, up and down the west coast, California to up to Washington over to Colorado, wildfires that are burning out whole communities. I’ve met families that are being evacuated or have been evacuated, never to return to their home. Firefighters who were fighting fires while their own homes were burning. My brother-in-law’s a firefighter. Tragedies. You look at the gulf coast states. The neighbor, our neighbors to Texas. Being battered by these storms. There have been now five named storms just this year. And they name a storm because it’s really bad. So Zeta being the last one, the most recent. In the Midwest, you’re seeing floods that have caused farmers to lose a whole season of crops. Joe Biden says, “We need to deal with this with a sense of urgency. We must embrace the science on this. We cannot play politics on this.” And we see that in this moment of opportunity to have timelines understanding, we must deal with this with a sense of urgency, that we also have the opportunity to grow our economy and create jobs. Joe sees the opportunity in the moment to invest in renewable energies, to invest in the apprenticeship programs with the folks like the building trades, knowing that we have a moment of opportunity to invest in America’s auto industry and be the best in the world in production of electric vehicles. All of these are opportunities to meet a moment of crisis if you are a real leader. And on the other hand, you have the current president of the United States who, when he was asked about the wildfires in California, so he was asked by a journalist, and the question was something like, “Well, Mr. President, these wildfires are happening and scientists are telling us there’s a real connection between the climate, the extreme changes, and human behaviors that are contributing to that. And what do you have to say?” The president of the United States who is also, again, the commander in chief, responded, “Science doesn’t know.” As though science is a person. And there’s a through theme here too, because right? That’s how he’s been treating the coronavirus, right? A refusal to embrace the people who are smart enough to know what is actually going on and give us some direction around how we need to deal with it instead of trying to make everybody think everything’s okay as though people aren’t smart enough to see what is happening around them. So all these things are at play, and so much more. And that brings me to this moment where we are today. I’m here in Texas to thank you for all you have been doing to speak up about these challenges and to remind people to vote here on the last day of early voting, four days before the end of the election. And I’m here to talk about it in the context of also understanding that there’s a lot that we need to get done. And there are a lot of reasons for folks to vote. And I think there are three reasons that it is important that people vote. One is to honor the ancestors. Honor the ancestors. I mean, we, Bernice, Mark, we all know we lost an incredible American human, just a hero, in Congressman John Lewis. Just a hero. He is now among the ancestors. John Lewis, who shed his blood at Edmund Pettus Bridge. John Lewis, who said to us, ” Get in good trouble.” John Lewis, who lived life that was about a commitment to fighting for equal rights and civil rights. And it was a fight that was born out of being a patriot and loving our country, knowing the best way we achieve our ideals is to fight for those ideals, to do it in every way by standing up, showing up, and speaking up. So we must vote to honor the ancestors. So we must vote to honor the ancestors. This year, we celebrated the 19th Amendment, the hundredth anniversary of the 19th Amendment. The ancestors, the suffragettes, who those hundred years ago in all of their white were marching and shouting for a woman’s right to vote saying, “We will not be deterred. We will not be left behind.” Now let us remember, because we almost must speak truth about history, that black women couldn’t vote until 1965. So we have to remember that. But yes, it is important to honor those who fought for this precious right, understanding that like Coretta Scott King told us, the fight for civil rights, for equal rights, for human rights, this fight for justice must be fought and won with each generation. And what she meant is it precious, these rights, but you cannot take them for granted. We must be vigilant. So we vote to honor the ancestors. We vote because everything is at stake. Everything is at stake. Let’s think about where we are. We talked about it in terms of these crises. I mean, let’s talk about it in terms of these 545 babies who right now have been orphaned because of a failure of the United States government to reunify them with their parents. Let’s talk about a nation under this administration that had a policy of separating children from their parents at the border. A nation that broke its promise to the Dreamers in terms of not following through on a commitment around DACA protections. There are so many things at stake, so that is a reason to vote. And the third reason is this. So I’m traveling the country and I’ve been to, in the last week and a half, in fact, I’m going back to Florida tomorrow, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Michigan. I mean you just name it. Okay? And one of the things that we have been seeing certainly since 2013, before for sure, but since 2013 when the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act, as we’ve been seeing as many as two dozen states putting in place laws through their state legislature that have been designed to suppress the vote, have been designed to make it difficult for people to vote. Have been done in such a way, you’ve seen that in Texas, where they’re trying to remove the drop boxes, where they’re trying to reduce the number of polls, where they’re saying if you vote from home, you need to fill out two envelopes. I mean, all kinds of things. Leaders who have tried to make it difficult and confusing and to suggest you can’t trust the process. In fact, at that first debate, the President of the United States took that stage in front of 70 million Americans, and in my opinion, openly encouraged a suppression of the vote. Not to mention what he’s doing and what they’re doing to mess with the post office. The post office. The best people in the world work for the post office. The post office. So we have to ask, why do we think so many powerful people are going out of their way to make it so difficult and confusing for us to vote? And I think the answer is because they know our power. They know our power. They know when we vote, things change. They know when we vote, we win. So let us not let anyone ever take our power from us. Let us use the power of our strong voices every day, in the spirit of John Lewis, in the spirit of the suffragettes, in the spirit of all of the generations of people here and in the future who are counting on us to know what is at stake and to step up and to stand up and to fight for this country we love. That is what is before us. And so my final point is this. This moment will pass. It will pass. And years from now, our children and our grandchildren and others, they will look at us, each one of us, they’re going to look in our eyes and they will ask us, “Where were you at that moment?” And you see, we’re going to be able to tell them so much more than just how we felt. We will tell them what we did. We will tell them what we did. We will tell them on this particular Friday afternoon, on the last day of early voting in Texas, we were sitting in a field, hanging out with Kamala. We will tell them we texted everybody, called everybody, emailed everybody we knew. That yes, we knew we were kind of getting on their nerves, but we also knew they’d get over it. That we reminded people of the path that we are on, that the shoulders upon which we stand, that we reminded people about what is at stake and that we reminded people about their power. And in this moment where we are dealing with crises we reminded our friends and our neighbors and our family that you are not alone. Don’t let anyone make you feel small. That you are big, you are strong, you have power. And at election time that power will be through your vote. And you will tell them when they ask that you elected Joe Biden, the President of the United States. Thank you Fort Worth, and God bless Texas."
"138","10-31-20"," Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome community leader D’Andre Young. … and for joining today’s car rally. My name is D’Andre Young and I was born and raised here in the great city of Flint, Michigan, and have been active in the community my entire life, organizing and engaging people to fight for environmental justice in the fight for clean, affordable water and sustainable infrastructure. I grew up union strong, with my family members working at the General Motors, and being proud members of the UAW. My mother was a union representative and liaison for Flint Community Schools. My family and my community motivates me to stay committed to the fight for equity, which starts at the grassroots level. I always tell people that fighting for change at the grassroots level is more than just your typical nine to five job. It’s your whole life. Right now, we desperately need a president who recognizes that. This pandemic has shined a bright light on the inequities that define our system. This president has used his words in this nation’s highest office to stoke the flames of hate and division. I don’t need to tell all of you that enough is simply enough. This just simply isn’t going to work for us. Ladies and gentlemen, we are just three days away from a day we will never forget. This is no doubt the most important election of our lives. And when November 4th rolls around, we need to know that we left it all on the table, that we did everything we could to elect the leaders we know we deserve. We’re at a crossroad crossroads right now. And meeting this moment means exercising your right to vote. It means telling your friends and family to vote. For those of you who have yet to vote, you can go to iwillvote.com. Again, that is iwillvote.com, to make your plan today. If you care about healthcare and the water you drink, you need to vote for Joe Biden. The stakes are too high to sit this one out. Joe Biden knows that change starts at the grassroots level. He knows that the best laws and policies demand a patient attentive ear to the ground. He will listen. He cares about us. He helped save the auto industry, which made a huge difference for thousands in Flint. And he will be more than a nine to five president, because he knows that’s what it takes to right the ship. Here in Flint, we are no strangers to what it takes, or rather what it means, to suffer a public health crisis. As our country and the world feels the weight of the COVID-19 pandemic, we’re all looking for hope in leadership to move us forward. I remember a time where we sought that same unique brand of hope. When we were going in the wrong direction, we used our power, made history, and elected the first black president of the United States. I’m so honored to introduce a man and president who embodies that hope, who forged a bright path forward. But, one little housekeeping item before I welcome him to the stage, we’re asking that you please refrain from honking your horns during President Obama and Vice President Biden’s remarks. Flint, please join me in welcoming to the stage, the 44th President of the United States of America, Barack Obama. Hello, Flint. It is good to be back in Michigan. Good to be back in the Midwest, getting a little closer to Chicago from here. Can everybody please give a big round of applause to D’Andre Young? Fantastic young man. Thank you for the introduction. Happy Halloween, everybody. I love your masks. Please give a big round of applause as well to Governor Gretchen Whitmer, your own, Lieutenant Governor Garlin Gilchrist, my buddy from the Senate, Debbie Stabenow, a man who’s always in there fighting for you, who we need to send back to the United States Senate, Gary Peters, your congressmen, born and raised right here in Flint, Michigan, Dan Kildee, Mayor Sheldon Neeley, and the big three to come, the next President of the United States, Joe Biden. Three days, Flint. Three days until the most important election of our lifetimes. I love you too. Listen, I know right now you’ve got the Michigan, Michigan State game, and that’s a big deal. Paul Bunyan Trophy’s on the line. But this Tuesday, everything is on the line. Our jobs are on the line, our healthcare is on the line, whether or not we get this pandemic under control is on the line. But here’s the good news, on Tuesday, you can choose change. On Tuesday, you can elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. You can choose a better America. And what’s even better news is, you don’t have to wait until Tuesday to cast your ballot, Michigan. You can vote in person right now. Just go to iwillvote.com, find your polling place, get out there, and vote. And if somebody like you already voted, go help your friends and family make a plan to vote. Because we need everybody, not just some people. We got to get everybody out there. I love you too. Okay. That’s it. Put that mask back on. Listen, Michigan, Joe Biden is my brother. I love Joe Biden. And he will be a great president. Now I’ll admit, 12 years ago, when I asked him to be the nominee for Vice President with me when I was running, I didn’t know Joe that well. We had served together in the Senate. But he and I came from different places, part of different generations. But I quickly came to admire Joe as a man who learned early on to treat everybody he meets with dignity and with respect, living by the words his mom taught him, “No one’s better than you, Joe. But you’re no better than anybody else. And that sense of decency, and empathy, the belief in hard work and family and faith, the belief that everybody counts, that’s who Joe is. And that’s who he’ll be as president. I can tell you, the presidency doesn’t change who you are, it shows who you are. It reveals who you are. And for eight years, Joe was the last one in the room whenever I faced a big decision. And he made me a better president. He’s got the character and the experience to make us a better country. And he and Kamala are going to be in the fight, not for themselves, but for every single one of us. And we sure can’t say that about the president we’ve got right now. You know, I’ve said this before, I never thought Donald Trump would embrace my vision. I understood he didn’t agree with my policies. But I did hope, for the country’s sake, that he might show some interest in the job, he might take the job seriously. He never has. He hasn’t shown any interest in doing the work, or helping anybody but himself and his friends, or treating the presidency as anything more than a reality show to give him the attention that he craves. But unfortunately, the rest of us have to live with the consequences. Almost 230,000 Americans are dead. More than a hundred thousand small businesses have closed. Almost 300,000 jobs are gone in Michigan alone. America just had its single worst week of new COVID cases. And what’s his closing argument? Here we are the worst week this week. I mean, we’ve been going through this now for months. The Federal Government has had an opportunity to respond for months. And his closing argument this week is that the press and people are too focused on COVID. COVID, COVID, COVID, he’s complaining. He’s jealous of COVID’s media coverage. And now he’s accusing doctors of profiting off this pandemic. Think about that. He said this just yesterday. He said, “Doctors are over-blowing it because they’re going to make money off it.” Doctors. He cannot fathom, he does not understand the notion, that somebody would risk their life to save others without trying to make a buck. His Chief of Staff says, “We’re not going to control the pandemic.” That’s a quote, said it last week, “We are not going to control the pandemic. We noticed, Mr. Chief of Staff. We understand you’re not going to control the pandemic. But you know who will? Joe Biden will, when we elect him President of the United States. You remember when Republicans were saying, “Let Detroit go bankrupt.” You remember that? Now they might as well be saying, “Let America get COVID.” Because that’s how they’re asking. If Trump were focused on COVID from the beginning, cases wouldn’t be reaching new record highs across the country. Cases wouldn’t be reaching new record highs across the country. Some of the places he holds rallies have even seen new spikes after he leaves town. There was just a study by Stanford University that just came out showing thousands of people are likely to have gotten sick because of these rallies he’s holding. What is his obsession, by the way, with crowd size? You notice that? This is the one measure he has of success. He’s still worrying about his inauguration crowd being smaller than mine. It really bugs him. He’s still talking about that. Well, I’ve had crowds before. Had to have quite a few, but when a country is going through a pandemic, that’s not what you’re supposed to be worrying about. That’s the difference between Joe Biden and Trump right there. Trump cares about feeding his ego. Joe cares about keeping you and your family safe. He’s less interested in feeding his ego with having big crowds than he is making sure he’s not going around making more and more people sick. That’s what you should expect from a president. You can expect something different from reality TV star, but from a president, you want them to put you above their own ego. Look, here’s the truth, Michigan. This pandemic would have been challenging for any president, but this idea that somehow this White House has done anything but completely screw this up is nonsense. Canada identified its first case the same week that the U.S. did, just few miles up. It’s not close. I may not be pointing north though. But Canada’s pretty close by. Our mortality rate in the United States is two and a half times higher than Canada. Think about that. If we had the same percentage of folks dying in Canada as we do here, nearly 90,000 Americans would have died instead of 230,000 Americans. If we had handled this pandemic like Canada did, 140,000 of our fellow Americans might still be alive today. Think about that. Think about that. Yet despite that, last week when Trump was asked if he’d do anything different, he said “Not much.” Really? “Not much. Can’t think of anything.” Listen, I understand the president was anxious to downplay it because he wanted to get credit for the economy that he inherited and zero blame for the pandemic he ignored, but it doesn’t work that way. The job doesn’t work that way. Pointing at the TV doesn’t fix things. Making stuff up doesn’t make people’s lives better. You got to have a plan. You’ve got to put in the work, and along with the experience to get things done, Joe Biden has concrete plans and policies that will turn our vision of a better, fairer, stronger country into reality. Joe’s not going to screw up testing. Joe’s not going to call scientists idiots. He’s not going to host superspreader events around the country. What Joe will do is get this pandemic under control with a plan to make testing free and widely available, to get a vaccine, every American, cost free, and make sure our frontline heroes never have to ask other countries for the equipment that they need. That’s what Joe Biden will do. Joe’s plan will guarantee paid sick leave for workers and parents affected by the pandemic. He’ll make sure the small businesses in every community, not just some, not just big corporations, but small businesses that hold our communities together and employ millions of Americans can reopen safely. Donald Trump likes to claim he built this economy. America created 1.5 million more jobs in the last three years of the Obama/Biden administration than in his first three years, and that was before he could blame the pandemic. Joe Biden and I, with the help of a democratic Congress, rescued the auto industry. Gary Peters was there. He told us to bet on Michigan, and we did, and manufacturing in Michigan grew by 15% over our last four years. Trump promised he’d make Michigan the manufacturing hub of the world again. It’s up 1% under his first four years, 15% under Obama/Biden. 1% under him. That’s Michigan right here. We handed him the longest streak of job growth in American history, but the economic damage he inflicted by botching the pandemic response means he’ll be the only president since Herbert Hoover to actually lose jobs. Herbert Hoover. That’s a long time ago. Joe Biden and Gary Peters know that the key to a strong economy isn’t cutting more taxes for billionaires. It’s lifting up the prospects for working Americans. Joe’s got a plan to create 1 million new auto-related jobs by accelerating electric vehicle production. He’s got a plan to create 10 million good clean energy jobs and fight climate change and a secure environmental justice, something that’s relevant to Flint, Michigan. You know something about that. He’ll pay for his plans by rolling back Trump’s tax cuts for billionaires. This is important. Joe sees this moment not to get back to where we were, but to build on the progress we made together and finally make long overdue changes so that our economy actually makes life a little easier for everybody, for the waitress trying to raise a kid on her own, for the student figuring out how to pay for next semester’s classes or the shift worker always on the edge of getting laid off or the cancer survivor who’s worried that her preexisting conditions protections will be taken away. Let’s talk about healthcare for a second. Let’s talk about healthcare for a second. Republicans love to say right before an election that they’ll protect your preexisting conditions. That’s what they say. Well, you know what? Joe and I actually protected them 10 years ago with the Affordable Care Act, and since we did so with no help from Republicans, no votes from Republicans, Republicans have tried to repeal or undermine the ACA more than 60 times. 60 times they’ve tried to take people’s healthcare away. When asked, “Why are you doing that? Why are you being so mean? You don’t think these people should have healthcare.” They say, “No, no, no, no. We’ve got a new plan. It’s going to be beautiful. It’s going to be terrific,” except it’s been 10 years now, and they still don’t have a plan. They’re trying to bamboozle you. Instead of actually coming up with a plan, they’ve attacked the ACA at every turn. They’ve driven up costs. They’ve driven up the number of uninsured. Now they’re trying to get the Supreme Court to take your healthcare away in the middle of a pandemic right at the time when people need healthcare. They’re signed onto a case right now in the Supreme Court where they’re trying to take insurance away from folks who need it with nothing but empty promises to take its place. Now Mitch McConnell is pouring millions of outside super PAC dollars into Michigan to try to beat Gary Peters because that’s part of their agenda. Michigan, here is the truth: Joe and Kamala and Gary will protect your healthcare, they will expand Medicare, they will make insurance more affordable for everybody. The reason you know that’s true is because they were there when we did it the first time. Here’s another thing with Joe and Kamala at the helm. This is a big benefit. Michelle and I were talking about this over dinner the other day. You’re not going to have to think about them every day. You’re not going to have to argue with your family about them every day. It won’t be so exhausting. You’ll be able to get on with your lives knowing that the president is not going to suggest we inject bleach as a possible cure of COVID. You won’t have to find out… You won’t wake up in the morning, open your phone, “Oh, news flash: The president retweeted conspiracy theories. The Navy SEALs then actually kill Bin Laden. You’re not going to have a president who goes out of his way to insult people just because they don’t support him. This is not normal behavior, people. We would not tolerate it from a teacher or a coach or a coworker or a family member. If a neighbor was acting like this, you’d stay away from that neighbor. Why would we accept it from the president of the United States? You know what? There are consequences to this action. There are consequences to his actions. This is not just a joke. It’s not funny. Those actions embolden other people to be mean and divisive and racist and a phrase of the fabric of all of our lives and it affects how our children see the world and how they treat each other. It affects the way our families get along. It affects the way the world sees America. That’s why Joe talks about the soul of America. That’s why he talks about decency and kindness and responsibility and hard work. That more than anything is what separates Joe Biden from his opponent. He actually cares about every American. He does not have a mean-spirited bone in his body. I have seen him. Spent time with people, strangers that he doesn’t know when he hears about… they’re going through a hardship, he talks about what he’s gone through. When he sees a kid, his eyes light up because he thinks about his own kids and grandkids. Joe Biden tries to live the values we cherish: honesty, hard work, kindness, humility, responsibility, helping somebody else out. That used to be the definition of manliness, not strutting and showing off, acting important, bullying people. Used to be being a man meant taking care of other people, not going around bragging, but just doing the work, not looking for credit, trying to live right, passing on those values to your kids, looking out for a community, carrying your weight, giving up a little bit of what you might have to help somebody who has a real need. When you elect Joe, that’s what you’ll see reflected from the White House. Those shouldn’t be Republican or Democratic values. They didn’t used to be. They’re what we grew up learning from our parents and from our grandparents, and they’re the values we still try to teach our kids. They’re not white or black or Hispanic or Asian or Native American values. They’re American values. We’ve got to reclaim them right now, but to reclaim them, we’re going to have to turn out like never before. If we’re going to reclaim those values, we need to leave no doubt. We can’t afford to be complacent. Not this time. Not in this election. We got a little complacent the last election. Listen, I understand why Americans get frustrated and sometimes think government’s not going to make a difference, voting’s not going to make a difference. I understand that government’s not perfect. The people in government are not perfect, even when it’s working. Government’s not going to solve every problem. But we can make things better. But we can make things better. A president can’t, by himself, solve every challenge facing the economy here in Flint or Michigan. But if we elect people like Gary Peters and Dan Kildee, and we get a House and a Senate joined with a White House that are more focused on working people and getting you the help that you need, they will make a difference. And some folks will get jobs that wouldn’t have otherwise had jobs, and some folks will have healthcare that wouldn’t otherwise have healthcare. A president by himself can’t eliminate all racial bias in our criminal justice system. But if we elect district attorneys and state’s attorneys and sheriffs focused on equality and justice, and we once again have a Justice Department and a Civil Rights Division in the Justice Department that cares about these issues, we can make things better. And that’s what voting’s about, not making things perfect, but making things better. It puts us on a track so that generations from now, we can look back and say, “You know what? Right about then, things started getting better again.” The fact that you don’t get a hundred percent of what you want right away, that’s not a good reason to vote. You just got to keep at it. You know, typically just over 50% of us vote who are eligible. Think about that. Almost half of the people in most elections who are eligible to vote, don’t vote. Imagine if 60% of us voted. Imagine if 70% of us voted. Imagine what’s going to be like to have a president and a vice president who believe in science, and who have a plan to protect this planet for our children, and who believe in racial equality, and are sending a clear signal that we’re all in this together, and are doing the work to bring us closer so that we have an America where no matter what we look like, where we come from, who we love, or how much money we’ve got, we can make it, and we have a place, and we’re treated with dignity and respect. Michigan, that’s what’s possible. And I’m asking you to remember that it’s possible. I want you to remember what this country can be, but you can’t just imagine a better future. You can’t just wish for it. You’ve got to fight for it. You’ve got to fight for it. We got to out-hustle the other side. We got to vote up and down the ticket like never before, right here in Michigan and all across the country. We’ve got to leave no doubt about who we are and what this country stands for. And if we do, we will send Gary Peters back to the Senate, and we will elect a man who loves this country and who cares about you and who will fight for every single one of us. And we’ll look out, not just for folks who support him, but even the folks who don’t. My friend, the next president of the United States of America, Joe Biden. Joe Biden. Joe Biden. Honk if you’re fired up. Honk if you are ready to go. Joe Biden. Hello, Flint. Mr. President, thank you, thank you, thank you. It kind of reminds you how good it can be listening to him, doesn’t it? As my mother would say about Barack, “God love him. He’s a good man.” Folks, it’s good to be back with friends. [inaudible 00:04:54], Governor Whitmer, Lt. Governor Gilchrist, Debbie Stabenow, my good buddy Gary Peters, who you are going to send back to the United States Senate, because I’m going to need him. We can always count on him to be your Senator for you and your family. And my good friend, Congressman Dan Kildee, who we need to send back to the House. Dan’s a good man, a good man. We used to have an expression up in Scranton. We’d say when someone wasn’t somebody else’s equal, we’d say, “He wasn’t a patch on his jeans.” I tell you what, Mr. President, you’re still driving him crazy because he knows he wasn’t a patch on your jeans. I tell you what, Barack Obama, it’s great to be with the president again. It reminds me what we can be when you have a president of character, a president respected around the world, a president our kids looked up to and did look up to. I want to say something we don’t say often enough, and I mean this on the bottom of my heart. Barack Obama was a great president of the United States of America. And I want to make sure we say it here today. Mr. President, thank you, thank you, thank you. Went through eight years without one single trace of scandal, not one single trace of scandal. It’s going to be nice to return to that. Flint, three days. Three days. We can put an end to this presidency we have now that has divided the nation. Three days. We can put end to a presidency that has failed to protect this nation. Three days. We can put an end to this presidency that has fanned the flames of hate all across this nation and made us a laughingstock around the world. Millions of Americans have already voted. Millions more are voting today, tomorrow, and God willing, all the way through to the close of the polls on Tuesday. And my message is simple. The power to change the country is, not figuratively, it is literally in your hands. I don’t care how hard Donald Trump tries. There’s nothing, let me say that again, there’s nothing that he can do to stop the people of this nation from voting in overwhelming numbers and taking back this democracy. And when Americans vote, no matter how many threats he makes, America will be heard. When America’s heard, I believe the message is going to be loud, and it’s going to be clear. It’s time for Donald Trump to pack his bags and go home. We’re done with the chaos, the tweets, the anger, the hate, the failure, refusing to take any responsibility. We’ve got a lot of work to do, got a lot of work to do. If I’m elected your president, we’re going to do it. We’re going to act. We’re going to need your help in doing it as well. We’re going to act to get COVID under control. On day one of my presidency, I’ll put in action a plan I’ve been talking about for months, already laid out, a national mandate. Mask wearing, social distancing, testing, tracing, all things, as President Obama just said, that should have and could have been put in place months and months ago. A plan for a full and fair, and free, I might add, distribution of therapeutics and vaccines when we get one. Imagine where we’d be if we had a president of wore a mask instead of mocking it. I can tell you this. We wouldn’t have 9 million confirmed cases of COVID in this nation, over 230,000 deaths. We wouldn’t be seeing a new record of cases we’re seeing right now. 90,000 cases yesterday. 90,000 new cases. By the way, 500,000 in just the past week. This guy tells us it’s going away. [inaudible 00:39:30] if he goes away. Folks, we wouldn’t be facing another 200,000 deaths in the next few months. This president knew in January the virus was deadly, and trying to improve his image. He tried to talk to Bob Woodward. He thought he could change his mind, but what he did, he let it be known all the way back in January, he knew how dangerous this pandemic was. And he hid it from the American people. He knew it was worse than the flu, but he lied to the American people. He knew it wasn’t going to disappear, but he kept telling us a miracle is coming. And yesterday, he had the gall to suggest that American doctors, people who are putting their lives on the line, on the front lines to save other lives, along with nurses and so many others, he suggested falsely that they’re inflating the number of COVID deaths to make more money. What in the hell is wrong with this man? Excuse my language, but think about it. It’s perverted. He may believe it because he doesn’t do anything other than for money. People of this nation have suffered and sacrificed for nine months, none moreso than the doctors in the front lines and healthcare workers. And this president is questioning their character, their integrity, their commitment to their fellow Americans. It’s more than offensive. It’s a disgrace, especially coming from a president who was waved the white flag of surrender to this virus. Our frontline health workers, they’ve given their all to beat the virus. We have a president who’s just given up. I will never raise the white flag of surrender. We’re going to beat this virus, and we’re going to get it under control. And the first step to doing that is beating Donald Trump. Look, Donald Trump keeps telling us what a great job he’s done as president. Oh, man. Well, did you know President Obama and I, as he pointed out, created more jobs in the last three years of our administration that he did in the first three years before the pandemic? How about this? Or did you know Donald Trump’s going to be the first president in nine years who’s going to finish his term with fewer jobs under his leadership than when he started? Look, that’s a lot of presidents. That’s a lot of crises, but only Donald Trump is going to have fewer jobs at the end of his presidency than when he started. You see, I and Barack understands something Donald Trump doesn’t. Wall Street didn’t build this country, you did. Working people built this country, and unions built the middle class. He’s done nothing but wage war on American labor. I see the UAW sign out there, first outfit ever endorsed me when I was a 29 year old kid. God love you. Look, we have a different view. We believe we should be rewarding work, not wealth, in this country. Under my plan, if you make less than $400,000 a year, you’re not going to pay a penny in additional taxes. But the wealthiest people, the biggest corporations… 91 of the fortune 500 companies paid zero in federal income tax last year. They’re going to start to pay their fair share. The super wealthy are going to pay the same rate they paid at the beginning of George Bush’s administration, and corporations are going to start to pay their fair share. Why should a firefighter, an educator, a nurse pay at a higher tax rate than someone making literally a billion dollars? Or should you? Why should you pay more taxes than Donald Trump? He paid $750 in taxes, the one year we know of. I released 22 years of my tax returns. You can go online and look. He hasn’t released one. He talks about corruption. What is he hiding? He owes $41 million out there. Who’s he owe it to? If you notice, he’s the only president I know of that has secret bank account in China, paid 50 times more taxes in Beijing than he’s paid in the United States, and this guy talks about corruption. Look, we’re also going to act to protect healthcare. Trump and the Republicans just jammed through a Supreme Court nominee for one overwhelming reason. For one overwhelming reason. As Barack said, the president said, we have been, they have been trying over 50 shots to take out Obamacare, destroy the Affordable Care Act, but they’re going to be in court. I believe it’s seven days after the election. Win or lose, they’re going to be in court. If they get their way a hundred million Americans will lose protections for preexisting conditions, including more than 4 million Michiganders. Donald Trump thinks healthcare is a privilege. Barack and I think it’s a right for people to have [inaudible 00:45:44] healthcare. We’re not only going to store Obamacare, we’re going to build on it. We’re going to keep your private insurance if you like it, and you can choose a Medicare like public option, if you don’t, we’re going to increase subsidies to lower your premiums and deductibles. Out of pocket spending, reduce prescription drug costs by 60%. Look, we’re going to make sure you keep the protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Meanwhile, Donald Trump laid out what he’s going to do in his second term, if he’s elected to [Social 00:46:17] Security. The actuary at the Social Security Administration says if he gets that plan passed, it will quote, bankrupt Social Security by 2023, something millions of Americans live on, paid for their whole life. When I said back six years ago, as Debbie will tell you, when I said the Republicans are going to try to eliminate Medicare, everybody said, “Nah, that’s crazy.” First thing Paul Ryan and Republicans in the Congress did, was cry to cut billions of dollars out of Medicare. These guys mean what they say. I’m going to protect Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, because there’s a lifeline for so many hard working folks. But folks I have to admit to you, it’s kind of personal with me. There’s nothing worse that this president has done in my view, than the way he speaks about our women and men in uniform, and those who have given their lives. He called them losers and suckers. My son, Beau, was a major in the United States Army, gave up the Attorney General’s job and petition to be able to go with his unit to Iraq for one solid year. After his US attorney, being in Kosovo, I might add I’m going to be a typical dad, he’s the only foreigner in Kosovo that has a 12 foot memorial dedicated to him. The major highway they built, the Beau Biden Highway because of his commitment. My son came home with a bronze star that could speak with his service but like so many others before he passed away. But guess what? He wasn’t a sucker. He wasn’t a loser, nor any of you who served, you’re patriots. And just like all of your sons and daughters, your parents or grandparents who serve. The president likes to portray himself, I love this, likes to portray himself as a tough guy. When you’re in high school, wouldn’t you have liked to take the shot? Anyway, that’s a different story, but anyway, a macho man, but when’s the last time you read about, saw or heard about a president of United States, literally be laughed at by world leaders when he spoke to the United Nations, laughed at out loud. When’s the last time you saw a president of United States being openly mocked by the leaders of NATO at a NATO conference? And can you believe we have a president who acts like Vladimir Putin’s puppy. Putin put boundaries out in the heads of American soldiers, serving in Iraq. And Trump was too scared to challenge him. Talk to him six time he’s never mentioned it. Trump’s not strong, he’s weak. He commands little respect to the international stage. This is the president who not only doesn’t understand sacrifice, you don’t understand courage, physical courage it takes to serve in uniform in a war zone. Maybe that’s why six generals and admirals who worked for him left his administration and said he was unfit to command, be commander in chief. When’s is the last time any president has had that happen? Tough guy. That’s why [Joy’s 00:50:07] special operations’ commander, General Stanley McChrystal. That’s why head of the Navy Seals, the one who saw the rate of Bin Laden, Admiral Bill McRaven, and 22 other four-stars have endorsed me say they support me to be their next commander in chief because like Obama and Bush and before him, they know we respect them, we support them. I’ve been in and out of war zones as Senator and vice-president over 35 times. I tell you what, these folks we have, only 1% of the country is in the military. We owe them, they’re the backbone, they’re the sinew, they’re the heart of who we are. That’s why we have to support our military and get rid of Trump. Folks, I want to tell you something, think about this. This is a guy who says there’s no such thing as climate change, he calls it a hoax. I see it as jobs, health, and safety. The impacts on climate are too often fall disproportionately on poor communities and communities of color. We’re going to make sure communities benefit from the hundreds of billions of federal investment in infrastructure and climate change. We’re going to do as a consequence of the change in the structure. We’re going to create local jobs to rebuild roads, fill sidewalk cracks, install broadband, create spaces to live, work, and play safely, to modernize infrastructure so you can turn on the faucet and clean water comes out. And when that happened in Flint will never happen again, anywhere in America. We can and must do this. Donald Trump has rolled back more than 100 environmental protection laws, many inactive under Barack and me. It’s also a host polluter, I’ll call polluters accountable with the most ambitious environmental justice agenda ever. Folks, we’re going to act to deliver on racial justice in America. Protesting is not burning or loading. Violent acts cannot be tolerated and it won’t, but these protestors is a cry for justice, the names of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Jacob Blake will not soon be forgotten. They’re going to inspire a new wave of justice in America. America has had their eyes opened up, they’re ready. Look, I believe this country has to come together. I know when I announced well over a year ago, when I said I wanted to unite the country, everybody said, “That’s naive. That was a long time ago. You did it before Biden, but you can’t do it again.” Oh, we can and we must, we have no choice. That’s how democracies work. I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president, I’ll work as hard for those who don’t support me as those who do. That’s the job of a president. It’s a duty to care, duty to care for everyone. So please vote, you still have an absentee ballot. Get it to a drop box as soon as you can. You could also safely vote earlier until Monday afternoon, or you can vote on Election Day, just make a plan, help get out the vote. As you’s heard this 10 times already, visit, iwillvote.com/mi. Folks, we have such an incredible opportunity. We’re voting for you. Well, God love you. Thank you very much, but here’s the deal guys. We got to vote up and down the ticket here. I honest to God believe, I give you my word as a Biden. I honest to God believe we’re in the cusp, we’re in an inflection point, we have a chance to make such enormous progress because the American people have seen what the other looks like. They’ve gotten a glimpse of the abyss. I really mean it, they’re ready. They’re ready to change so much. I’ll never forget what president Kennedy said when he promised to send us to the moon. He used the phrase that has guided me. He said, ” We’re doing it because quote, we refuse to postpone.” Well, I refuse to postpone the incredible opportunities to the United States of America for the American people. There is nothing beyond our capacity. There is no limit to America’s future. The only thing that can tear America apart is America itself. And that’s exactly what Donald Trump has been doing from the beginning of this campaign, divided America, pinning Americans against one another based on race, gender, ethnicity, national origin, it’s wrong. It’s not American, that’s not who we are. Folks, everybody knows who Donald Trump is. Let’s keep showing them who we are. We choose hope over fear. We choose unity over division. We choose science over fiction and yes, we choose truth over lies. My fellow Americans it’s time for us to stand back and stand up and take back our democracy. We can do this, we’re so much better than we’ve been. We can be what we are at our best. The United States of America. God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."
"139","11-01-20"," Hello, hello, hello. Hello, Philadelphia. It’s great to these everyone. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I want to thank Bishop Reid. I really mean it. Sharon Baptist Church for letting us borrow your parking lot. And the DNC Vice Chair, I tell you what, that man can make a speech, can’t he? He’s pretty darn impressive. Vice Chair Blake, for all you do for our party and all you do to get out the vote. And thank you Congressman Dwight Evans for coming out and speaking today. And for all of you, all of you, all you do to fight for the people of Philadelphia and every single day in Congress. I also want to say thank you to Bishop Hunter and Reverend Mark Tyler, State Representative Morgan. Where’s Morgan. Is he … there you go. Okay. Thank you for being here. Thank you for being here. And Bishop Louis Felton, and also want to thank Sharon Baptist choir, church choir. You know, one of the things I most enjoyed about being back on the campaign trail was meeting with the Black faith leaders all around the country. The churches I get to go to during the primaries and over 400 Black leaders, church leaders, supporting us. Almost every Sunday I’d get to sit in the pew and get inspired. I’d go to mass first early in the morning, then I go to the Black church to get some hope and some invigoration, man. I’d talked to people. I talked to people, hear what was on their minds. Pray with them. And that’s what, it was renewing. It was not about me, but our entire family. Jill would be with me and my grandkids. One of my grandkids is with me today, who’s a senior here in Philadelphia in college. I also thought a lot about this campaign. It’s been unlike any other campaign in history. There’s one thing that remains the same, we have to earn our democracy. We have to get out and vote. And as my late friend John Lewis reminded us, freedom is not a state, freedom is an act. We have to defend it. We have to vote. And this is the most important election of our lifetimes. We’re at an inflection point. So we have to vote like we never did before. Every day, every day is a new reminder of how high the stakes are, of how far the other side will go to try to suppress the turnout, especially here in Philadelphia. President Trump is terrified of what will happen in Pennsylvania. He knows if the people of Pennsylvania get to have their say, if you don’t have your say, he doesn’t stand a chance. But the American people, the American people will not be silenced. Over 90 million people have already voted. Already voted. They’ve had enough. They’ve had enough. There’s too much on the line to sit it out, but we only have two more days. Two more days we can put an end to this presidency that has from the very beginning sought to divide us, to tear us apart. Folks, in two days we can put an end to a president that has failed to protect this nation. In two days, we can put and end to a presidency that fanned the flames of hate, poured gasoline on every opportunity he had all across this nation. As I said, millions of Americans have already voted. Millions more will vote in the two days ahead, but there’s still a lot of Pennsylvanians who haven’t voted yet, and we need every single one of you to get out and vote on Tuesday. My message is simple, Pennsylvania is critical in this election. I live in Delaware, but I’m a Pennsylvania boy born in Scranton. And I want to tell you, the last time Donald Trump ran he won this state by 44,000 votes. So every single vote matters. The power, the power to change this country is literally in your hands. I don’t care how hard Donald Trump tries, there is nothing, nothing he’s going to do to stop this nation from voting. No matter what he tries. And folks, when American’s vote, America will be heard. When America’s heard, I believe the message is going to be loud and clear. It’s time for Donald Trump to pack his bags and go home. Time to breathe some life back into this nation. We’re done. We’re tired of the tweets, the anger, the hate, the failure, the irresponsibility. We got a lot of work to do. I’m I elected your president, we’re going to do it and we’re going to act and we’re going to start from the very first day. We’re going to act to get COVID under control. It’s almost criminal the way he has handled it. On day one of my presidency I’m going to put in action a plan I’ve been talking about for months, masking, social distancing, testing, tracing, a plan for full and fair and free distribution of therapeutics, vaccines, when we get one. A plan to address the disproportionate way this virus … vaccines when we get a one. A plan to address the disproportionate way this virus has been hitting and devastating the black community across America. Folks, every single day we’re seeing race-based disparities in every aspect of this virus. Higher infections rates, lower access to testing, harder time quarantining safely, lower access to quality treatment when you become infected, and tragically, higher mortality rates, three times as many African Americans are dying as white Americans … when they get the virus One in 100 Black Americans, excuse me, one in 1,000 Black Americans have died from COVID-19. And if we don’t change between now and January, it’s estimated one in 500 by the end of this pandemic. That is a mass casualty event in the Black community. And it’s totally unnecessary. Totally uncalled for. My public health plan will ensure the needs of communities that are being hit the hardest by this virus are a priority, not an afterthought. We’re going to have the plan to get our economy back on track. Not to get the back where we were, but to build back better, to make sure everyone is dealt in on a full scale share of the American dream. We’re going to address systemic racism and build real rural economic opportunity and equality for the Black community. The blinders have been taken off. The American people have seen, they’ve seen how bad things are. To make it easier to start a business, to buy your first home, to pursue an education after high school without being burdened with debt, to invest in HBCUs that do so much to mold Black leaders of tomorrow. I mean it. It’s not just talk. I mean it. We’re going to have to deliver racial justice in America. I see in all the protests here in Philadelphia and across the country a cry for justice. Folks, protesting is not burning or looting and violence must never be tolerated. It won’t. But the names of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Jacob Blake, Walter Wallace Jr., they will not soon be forgotten. They will not be forgotten by me, they will not be forgotten by you, and they’ll not be forgotten by the American people because here’s what they’re going to do. They’re inspiring a new wave of justice in America. And George Floyd’s little girl, six years old, said to me when I went to be with the family … I knelt down to say hi to her and she looked at me and she said, “Daddy is going to change the world.” Daddy, that’s what she said to me. Six years old. Daddy. Look, we can change the world. Not in one fell swoop. We can change it. We all know this country has to come together. We can not afford four more years of anger, hate, and division that we’ve seen under this president. Folks, look, from the day he announced, from the moment he came down that escalator, what did he say in New York? He said, “We’re going to go out and get those rapist Mexicans.” Rapist Mexicans. He put a ban on all Muslims coming to the United States. And the way he talked about the African-American community. The way he talked about the Hispanic community. Look, folks, we got to come together. I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president for everybody. I will work as hard for those who don’t support me as those who do support me. I mean it. That’s the job of a president, the duty to care, the duty to care for everyone. In President Biden’s America, there will be no red states or blue states, there will only be the United States of America. Look, our faith in our country is being tested, but our faith in God is helping us through because of all of you. Thank you for your commitment to the greatest commandment, love our neighbors as ourselves. And for our dedication to never grow weary of doing good. Being with you all reminds me of that gospel hymn that inspired so many of us. When I last talked to John Lewis, as he’s dying, he reminded me of it. I don’t feel no ways tired. I’ve come too far from where I started from. Nobody told me the road would be easy. I don’t believe he brought me this far to leave me. He did not leave us. We are not tired. The road hasn’t been easy, but we’ve come too far to stop now. So please vote. Get everyone you know to vote. We need to get every soul in Philadelphia to the polls. Your voice, your vote matters. Your voice deserves to be heard. And if you still have an absentee ballot, get it to a dropbox as soon as you can. Or you can vote on election day, but make a plan. And I mean it, make a plan now. Help get out the vote. Go to iwillvote.com/pa. Folks, folks, you know I’ve been doing this awhile. One of the reasons I got elected in the first place in Delaware across the line was because of the folks in Pennsylvania. All the media and Pennsylvania, all the media in Delaware for the first 25 years of my career was all Philadelphia television. There wasn’t no Delaware television. And I was very happy to have the moniker of being known as Pennsylvania’s third Senator. I know Philadelphia well. I married a Philly girl, by the way. And by the way, I got my Eagles jacket on. Folks, here’s what I want to say and I’ll conclude. You’ve been here a long time. I’ll never forget when President John F. Kennedy said, when he promised that we’re going to go to the moon. He said, he said words and my colleagues in the senate always used to kid me for repeating. He said, “We’re doing it because we Americans, we refuse to postpone.” Well, I refuse to postpone the incredible opportunities available to the American people. I refuse to postpone what we can do. There’s nothing beyond the capacity of the United States of America. Nothing. There’s no limit to America’s future. The blinders have been taken off. The only thing could tear America part is America itself. And that’s exactly what Trump’s been trying to do from the very beginning, dividing America based on race, religion, gender, national origin. It’s wrong. It’s not who we are. This is not who we are. Everybody knows who Donald Trump is. Let’s keep showing them who we are. Folks, and I mean this, this is not just campaign rhetoric. We choose hope over fear. We choose unity over division. We choose science over fiction and yes, we choose truth over lies, the multiple lies he repeats. It’s time to stand up. It’s time to take back our democracy. We can do this. We’re better than this. We’re better than what we’ve been. We can be at our best. This is the United States of America. God bless you all and may God protect our troops. I love you. I love you. You brought me to the dance. Thank you, thank you, thank you. God love you all. Keep the faith. Every time I walk into my grandpop’s house in Scranton, walk out the door, Bishop B’d yell, “Joey, keep the faith.” When my grandmother was alive, she’d yell, “No Joey, spread it.” Let’s spread the faith."
"140","11-02-20"," … centers, the living room down the block. You’ll be where? Okay, we’ll be there. We are the movement that will beat Donald Trump. Welcome. We’re going to have to sweat for it. We’re going to have to sacrifice and fight. We’re going to have to lead. Everyone is going to have to lead with kindness, humility, empathy, and not just talk, but action. Action today. Action tomorrow. Action until we win. And we will win if we do this together. It’s who we are. It’s who we always have. Now, let’s show them. As a reminder, today’s event has been set up to adhere to social distancing guidelines as outlined by health experts in the state of Ohio. Thank you for being here. Please. Welcome Courtney Mosley. Good morning, everyone. My name is Courtney Mosley and I am a local attorney and secretary for the Northeast, Ohio Young Black Democrats. Cleveland is a city I am proud to call home. I was born here, raised here, and despite yesterday’s game, I am still a loyal Cleveland Browns fan. I’ve seen first hand the impact this president’s inaction and indifference that has had on my community. People are hurting. Businesses are shuttered. Our people have lost their jobs and too many families have lost a loved one. And the truth is, it didn’t have to be this bad. It doesn’t have to be this bad. And we can make it better by voting for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. With so much on the ballot, the stakes in this election couldn’t be any higher. And the choice, well, it couldn’t be any clearer. Joe Biden understands the issues we face and will provide the strong leadership and unity. We need to move our country forward. I’m voting for Joe and Kamala because I know they’ve got my back. They see me and they’ll fight for me. They have a plan to get this virus under control, to get our economy back on track and to build Ohio better than it was before. For healthcare, for jobs, for justice, for education, and for a clear, brighter future, the choice is clear. We need Joe Biden and Kamala Harris’s leadership in the White House. Just a few months ago, the pundits and pollsters said we didn’t have a shot in Ohio. Now, a day before the election, we’re neck and neck in what has become this country’s closest race. Ohio, we’re so close, but there’s more work left to do. We can’t let up just yet. We need to work for it. We need to turn up and turn out like our lives and our futures depend on it, because it does. If you have a ballot, turn it in. If you haven’t voted, make a plan. If you haven’t reached out to friends and family, do it now. We don’t want to wake up on November 4th wondering if we did enough. It is up to us to bring this home for Joe and for Kamala. If we win Ohio, we deny Trump another four years, period. It’s that simple. We can’t afford to let this opportunity pass us by. We need to do everything we can to turn every voter and elect Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and Democrats down the ballot. I’m fired up, I’m ready to go, and I hope you are too. And with that, it gives me great honor to introduce the next president of the United States, Joe Biden. Hello, Cleveland. Whoa. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. And you guys can push the other something real quick, I tell you. Thank you very, very much. And Courtney, thank you for that introduction. And I want to thank Representative Marcia Fudge. We’ve been hanging out in the back here in the tent, along with [inaudible 00:06:51] out there, and Joyce is out here. Joyce Beattie, I can’t see it. Oh, there you are. Okay, I see you guys. And by the way, I want you all to meet, I got four of my grandchildren with me today. All my grandkids, stand up, stand up. They’re my good luck charms. They’re my heart. And Marcy and Joyce and Tim Ryan. Tim, you over there too? Hey, Tim. Tim, you’ve been so great the whole campaign. Thank you very, very, very much. And he as tough as nails. They’re all incredible leaders and we need to send them back to Congress, every single one of them. Folks, I want to thank my buddy, Sherrod Brown. No one fights harder for the dignity of working people than Sherrod does. Sherrod won reelection in ’18 about at the same margin that Trump did. And so when Sherrod tells me to come to Ohio the day before, I come to Ohio. That’s what I do because he and I have something in common. We married way up. He married a Pulitzer prize winner. I married a professor, and I tell you what, Connie you’ve been wonderful. Connie actually reviewed my wife’s book, I found out. Anyway, I want to thank you for being here. Folks, Ohio, one more day, one more day. Tomorrow. Tomorrow we have an opportunity to put an annual presidency. That’s divided this nation. Tomorrow we can put an ad to a president as has failed to protect this nation. And tomorrow we can put it down to a president who has fanned the flames of hate all across this country. Millions of Americans have already voted. Almost a hundred million have voted so far, a hundred million voted already, and more are going to vote today. And my message is simple. The power to change the country is in your hands. No matter how much Donald Trump tries, there’s nothing, nothing he’s going to do to stop the people in this nation from voting. Folks, he hasn’t figured it out. Presidents don’t determine who gets to vote. Voters determine who’s going to be the president. When America votes, America will be heard. When America is heard, I believe the message is going to be loud and clear. It’s time for Donald Trump to pack his bags and go home. We’re done. We’re done with the chaos. We’re done with the tweets, the anger, the hate, the failure, the irresponsibility. We’ve got a whole lot of work to do. When I’m elected your president, I’m going to act, and I’m going to act on day one. Folks, we’re going to act to get this COVID under control. On day one of my presidency, we’re going to put it in action a plan that I’ve been talking about for months, and he’s been paying no attention to. Masking, social distancing, testing, tracing. A plan for a fair and full and free distribution of therapeutics and vaccines, when we get one. Imagine, imagine where we’d be, had this president, from the beginning, just wore a mask instead of mock wearing a mask. I can tell you this. We wouldn’t have 9 million confirmed COVID cases in this nation, wouldn’t have over 230,000 deaths, wouldn’t be seen those new record numbers of cases we’re seeing every single day, right now. Nearly 100,000 cases in one day, just two days ago. 100,000 new cases. We wouldn’t be facing another 200,000 projected deaths in the next few months. This president knew, last January, the virus was deadly, but he hid it from the American people. He knew it was worse than the flu. He lied to the American people. He knew it wasn’t going to disappear, but he kept telling us a miracle was coming. And just Friday, you had the gall… Figure this, now. The president of the United States of America, who’s responsible for so many deaths, he had the gall to suggest that American doctors, the people who have been on the front lines of this crisis for nine months, along with nurses and so many others, many of whom have died, to suggest that doctors are falsely inflating deaths due to COVID because they want to make more money. I’m serious, man. This guy’s a disgrace. The people of this nation have suffered. They’ve sacrificed for nine months, not more than those doctors and nurses and those healthcare workers. And this president is questioning their character, their integrity, their commitment to their fellow Americans. As I said, it’s a disgrace. And last night, Trump said he was going to fire Dr. Fauci. Isn’t that wonderful? I got a better idea. Elect me, and I’m going to hire Dr. Fauci, and we’re going to fire Donald Trump. Donald Trump waved the white flag of surrender to this virus. He did that. His own chief of staff said, last week, we’re giving up on the virus. We’re not going to do anything about it. I’m never going to raise the white flag and surrender. We’re going to beat this virus. We’re going to get it under control, I promise you. Look, the first step to beating the virus is beating Donald Trump. Donald Trump keeps telling us what a great jobs president he is. I was just with Barack in Detroit and Flint. It was great to be with a president of some character, a president respected around the world, a president our kids could and did look up to. But did you know that, after President Obama and I bet on American workers and helped rescue the auto industry, nearly 500,000 jobs created here in Ohio. Meanwhile, 330,000 of those have been lost since Trump’s become president. You know, Donald Trump is going to be the first president in 90 years… that’s a lot of presidents… in 90 years, is going to finish his four years in office with fewer jobs than when he got elected to office. It’s no surprise. Remember the lies he told all the workers. He told the families of the GM plant in Lordstown. He said, “Don’t move. Don’t sell your house.” But then the plant shut down. And after the first debate in Cleveland, I met an Ohio woman named Tiffany whose husband lost their job at the plant. And he had to take a job eight hours away in another state. He drives home weekends, 16 hours round trip, to be home with his kids. So much for “Don’t worry. What about his threat and his grudge against Goodyear? What about his broken promise to protect pensions for workers, especially [inaudible 00:14:35] employer pensions? And what about… He stopped the overtime for millions of American workers, over $1,200,000,000 for American workers, the president and I was helping your delegation put in place. But let’s not forget how Donald Trump is wreaking chaotic with China on trade. Farm bankruptcies are way up. Exports are way down. Agricultural exports to China during the Trump years have been 40% lower than they were when we were in our second term. And he even says, because of his bailouts to the farmers… that’s your tax dollars, by the way… his bailout of the farmers, “Our farmers are doing better now than when they actually had a farm.” Can you believe that? Our farmers are doing better now than when they actually had a farm because they were able to be bailed out, although they may not have a farm anymore. Who does this guy think he is? My policies are going to hold China accountable. I’ll end the Trump tax loopholes that incentivized companies to ship jobs overseas. I’ll add a 10% surtax on companies who do ship jobs overseas. But for companies who bring and come back and invest in American manufacturing and bring jobs back home, I’ll offer a 10% tax credit. And folks, it’s no violation of any trade agreement, but no government contracts. And the president has about $600 billion in contracts from the military on down. No government contract will be given it to a company that isn’t have all the products, including the supply line, all products made in America, every product. Look, and our future will be made right here, right here in Ohio. Folks, we’re in a position that we can do so much more, so much more. Folks, Donald Trump forgot and betrayed Ohio workers. Quite frankly, I grew up around guys like Donald Trump. I grew up in neighborhoods like probably many of you did, working class neighborhoods where most people didn’t have a college education. But we had guys like Trump we used to play against, when we played ball and Scranton and [inaudible 00:08:07]. And because they had more money than we did, they kind of look down their nose on us. I got to admit to you. I got a bit of a chip on my shoulder, when I read about… Once we won the nomination and things began to look a little better, I read from serious press people… they’re decent, honorable people… that if I get elected, I’ll be the first president who didn’t have an Ivy League degree, in a long time. Well, let me tell you something. Somehow that’s got to mean I didn’t belong, because I went to a state university. But let me tell you what. It’s about time a guy from a state university graduated into the White House because, if I’m there, you’re going to be there, too. Trump sees the world from Park Avenue, looking down on Wall Street. I see it from Scranton and Claymont, where I grew up. I shaved from here in Cleveland. Wall Street didn’t build America, the middle class built America. And guess what? Unions built the middle class. That’s a fact. The day is long past time, we start rewarding work, not wealth in this country. Under my plan, if you make less than $400,000, you won’t pay a single penny, more in taxes. You have my word on it. But I tell you what, the wealthiest of MOS, big corporations, 91 of which don’t pay any tax, that paid zero federal income tax. They’re going to start paying their fair share. It’s not right. Why should you pay for taxes than Donald Trump for God’s sake? Look, I released 22 years of my tax returns. You can look them up online. Donald Trump didn’t release any. Wonder what the hell he’s hiding. I wonder why he won’t let anybody know what his tax returns are. Who’s he owe the money to? This is the guy, by the way we found out recently has a secret bank account in China. Paid 50 times more tax in Beijing than he did in the United States. And overall, the one income tax the New York Times got, he paid $750 in federal taxes. How about you? And when he was asked how he could pay so little, remember what he said? He said, “because I’m smart. I know how to game the system.” And that’s the kind of guy you want as president? That can game the system, be a billionaire pay 750 bucks in taxes. While you all break your necks, break your necks to pay a fair share. We’re going to act to protect healthcare by the way. Trump and Republicans just jammed through a new Supreme Court nomination for one basic reason. Within a week after the election, they’re going to be before the Supreme Court and this new nominee is going to be out of the court. It’s all about destroying the Affordable Care Act, getting rid of it completely. They’ve been trying to do it now for nine years, if they get their way, 100 million Americans will lose protections for preexisting conditions, including nearly 5 million folks here in Ohio. Look, Donald Trump doesn’t understand healthcare. He thinks it’s a privilege. I think healthcare is a right. By the way, because of the way he ruined the economy, even before the pandemic, 10 million Americans have already lost their employer-based healthcare because the employer has gone out of business. Now he wants to go after the 22 million, who have healthcare only because of the Affordable Care Act. I’m not only restore the Affordable Care Act, I’ll build on it. You can keep your private insurance, or you can choose a Medicare-like public option in the new plan. I’m going to increase subsidies and lower premiums and deductibles, out of pocket expenses and surprise billings. We’re going to reduce drug costs by 60% by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices for all of us. Folks, folks, it’s going to cost more money, but guess how I’m going to pay for it? Trump’s going to start paying some taxes. We’re going to make sure we keep protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Meanwhile, the Social Security expert, the person the Social Security department says if Donald Trump’s plan that he announced, if he’s reelected, he’s going to put in place, if in fact it’s put in place, it would bankrupt Social Security by 2023. This guy really cares a lot about this, doesn’t he? He really understands, [inaudible 00:22:56] my parents before me and everyone else paying into Social Security. So go home and tell your parents and grandparents, what a great deal they’re going to get if Trump gets reelected. But folks, the fact is I’m going to protect your Social Security. I guarantee it. Because I got people behind me who’re going to make sure it’s protected. We’re going to protect Social Security, and we’re going to have a situation where guess what? We have a majority in the United States Senate. Well, folks, look, the thing that’s bothered me most, maybe emotionally bothered me the most, but substantively as well. That this president has done, there’s been nothing worse than the way he’s spoken about those who have served in uniform. He called you all losers and suckers. My son Beau was the attorney general of the state of Delaware. My son Beau volunteered. He had to give up the seat of attorney general to volunteer, to go to Iraq for a year. He won the Bronze Star, the Conspicuous Service Medal, and he saw the people die in Iraq. He was not a loser. He was not a sucker, he was a Patriot, just like all your sons and daughters, parents, or grandparents who served. Folks, six generals who worked in the white house with the president of United States and admirals worked in his administration have since left. And they’ve said he is unfit to be Commander in Chief. Best of my knowledge, that’s never happened before for any president of the United States. And that’s why special operations commander Stanley McChrystal, as well as the commander special ops and the Navy Seals who took out Brin Laden, along Bill McRaven, Admiral McRaven, along with 22 other four stars, they’ve endorsed me saying they’d be proud to have me as their Commander in Chief. This president likes to portray himself as a tough guy, a macho man. When the last time you saw a president of United States, literally being laughed at by the world leaders when he spoke to the United Nations? I don’t ever recall that ever happening. Can you believe when the president of United States, who acts like Vladimir Putin’s puppy, Putin put bounties on the heads of American soldiers in Afghanistan. Trump spoke to him six times and he was too frightened to challenge him. Why? Donald Trump is not strong, he’s weak. This is a president who not only doesn’t understand sacrifice, he doesn’t understand courage. Physical courage it takes for so many of you to put on that uniform. We must support our military. Let’s make this vote for them as well. God love them. We have to vote to meet the challenge, the climate crisis as well. We can act to meet that climate crisis. Trump calls the climate crisis a hoax. I see it as a great opportunity to improve our health as well as great millions of good paying jobs. I see America’s working to build and install 500,000 charging stations all across this country. American consumers switching to clean electric vehicles. We can own the electric vehicle market, creating minutes of jobs here in Cleveland and in Ohio and in Detroit. Folks, I see the federal government harnessing the purchasing power by buying these electric vehicles. Made in Ohio, made in Detroit, made in America. It’s going to mean one million, according to the experts, one million new good paying auto jobs in the automobile industry alone. Folks, if we don’t act China’s going to own the market. China’s going to own it all. And we will act, in addition to deliver racial justice in America. Folks, protesting is not burning and looting, violence must never be tolerated and it won’t, but these protests are a cry for justice. The names of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Jacob Blake will soon not be forgotten. You know I’ve met with all these families. Well I met with Floyd’s little girl, I think she was six years old. I knelt down to say, or to be at eye level with her. She looked at me and she said, I swear to God, said, “Mr. Vice President, my daddy is going to change in the world. My dad is going to change the world. Folks, I’m not going to forget. You’re not going to forget. This country’s not going to forget. This is going to inspire a new wave of justice in America. But guess what? Because we have the X generation, I mean the Z generation, that in fact is the most open, least prejudice, best educated generation in American history. They’re already moving. They’re already insisting on justice. They know who we are. A new wave of justice America, but also true justice isn’t just about how they deal with police, it’s about jobs. It’s about building wealth. It’s about families. It’s about education. It’s about opportunity. It’s about being able to make a decent living. Nobody should have to work two jobs to stay out of poverty. That’s why, honk if you agree with me that a $15 minimum wage is necessary nationwide. Honk. Honk, if you think assistance for a down payment, for a real shot of home ownership should be coming forward with me with $15,000 for first time homeowner, to start a small business, send the child to college debt-free. Folks, Ohio in 2008, 2012, you place your trust in me and Barrack. In 2020, I’m asking you to trust me again. I’m proud of the coalition this campaign is built. To welcome Democrats, Republicans and Independents. I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I’ll govern as an American president. There will be no red States and blue States, just the United States. And I promise you I’ll work as hard for those who don’t support me as those who do. That’s the job of a president, to care, to care about everybody, everybody. That’s the duty of a president. And look, you too, have a duty, a duty to vote. Folks, make a plan, go to Iwillvote.com/OH. Folks, the amazing thing about this moment in our history, on the one hand, we’re facing the biggest threat of who we are, what we believe, and what we seen, what we’ve been in our lifetimes. Another hand, our future has never been more promising. I’ve said it many times, the character of America is literally on the ballot. The character of our country, but I’m more optimistic about America’s future today than when I was elected to the United States Senate as a 29 year-old kid. Let me tell you why. We are better positioned than any nation in the world to lead the 21st century. Our workers are three times as productive as other workers. We have the biggest economy in the world. We have the strongest military in the history of the world. We have the most innovative entrepreneurs in the world and we are virtually energy independent. We have more great research universities in America than all the rest of the world combined, out of which all these doing inventions have occurred. No other nation can match us. We lead by the example of our power, not just by the power of our example. The only thing that can tear America apart is America itself. And that’s exactly what Donald Trump has tried to do from the beginning of his campaign, divide America. The only way he can win, separate us. Pit Americans against one another based on race, gender, ethnicity, national origin. It’s wrong. It’s not who we are, but it’s his only prospect. Everybody knows who Donald Trump is. Let’s keep showing them who we are. We choose hope over fear. We choose unity over division. We choose science over fiction and yes, we choose truth over lies. Folks, it’s time to stand up. It’s time to take back our democracy. We can do this. We’re so much better than this. We can be our best, ladies and gentlemen. This is the United States of America. There’s not a damn thing we can’t do, nothing. So let’s get up and do it. God bless you all and may God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."
"141","11-03-20","Crowd: Here we go, Joe. Joe Biden: Can you hear me? Crowd: Yeah. Joe Biden: My name is Joe Biden. Crowd: That’s right. Joe Biden: I was born in Mercy Hospital in Scranton. By the way, you have no idea how that old expression, when my dad lived up here and we had to move because things kind of fell apart in terms of jobs, but my great grandfather, Edward Francis Blewitt, was the first Irish-Catholics elected to the state senate in the state of Pennsylvania from Scranton in 1907. It’s a long, long history, but it’s good to be home. One of the things, I know everybody says, “Why do you keep calling it home?” Well, I left here when I was going into the fourth grade, but I came home almost all summer, every summer. Joe Biden: When I got married to my deceased wife, my wedding party was seven people, five of them are friends from Scranton. I grew up here. So Scranton’s where I learned, like you did, all my basic values. I learned at my grandpa’s table at 2446 North Washington Avenue, that money did not determine your wealth. I learned that if you want anything to do it, then do it when you set your mind to it. I learned that basic responsibility everybody had was just to look out, just to look for the other guy, look out at what’s going on, beware what’s going on. Joe Biden: My dad used to have an expression when we left Scranton and moved down to Delaware. He said, “Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s like your dignity. It’s about respect, it’s about your place in the community. It’s about who you are. It’s about being [inaudible 00:01:49] and how it’s going to be okay.” Well, guess what, an awful lot of people can’t say that now. A lot of people can’t look at their kids now and say it’s going to be okay. Joe Biden: I ran for three reasons and I’m going to stop and not keep you out here. Number one, I said when I announced that I wanted to restore the soul of the country, but I wasn’t being melodramatic. All I meant was restore basic decency and honor to the White House. When I saw those folk come out of those fields down in Charlottesville, carrying those torches and you close your eyes and remember what you saw, [inaudible 00:02:34]. They were carrying Nazi flags and talking about how [inaudible 00:02:40]. This country’s soul is so black with prejudice that it just… That’s when I decided I had to run. That’s when my granddaughter and the other three of them came to see me, after that happened, because they knew I was going to say, “Poppy’s got to run. We know it’s going to ugly.” Because their whole life, they’ve either had a father who was the Attorney General of the State of Delaware or a Grandpop who was the senator or Vice President. That’s why we ran. Joe Biden: The second reason we ran is we’ve got to restore the backbone of the country. You all know it. The middle class built this country. Wall Street didn’t build it, the middle class built it. And Unions built the middle class. They’re getting clobbered right now. They’re getting clobbered. The third reason I’m running, is what I want to update about today and that is uniting this country. Crowd: Yeah. Joe Biden: We have to unite the country and we can do it. I think the country’s ready. But I basically came to say thank you and thank you and thank you. Crowd: Thank you, thank you. Thank you, Joe. Joe Biden: It’s no sacrifice, it’s the greatest honor in my life. It’s the greatest honor in my life. I’m sure the mayor and Bobby feel the same way about serving. It’s a great honor. I want to thank you all and I know you’re out canvasing, knock on three or four thousand doors, we’ll have no problem. No, I’m only kidding with you. Exactly what you’ve done, I really appreciate it."
"142","11-04-20"," Your patience is commendable. We knew this was going to go long, but who knew we’re going to go into maybe tomorrow morning, maybe even longer. But look, we feel good about where we are. We really do. I’m here to tell you tonight, we believe we’re on track to win this election. We knew because of the unprecedented early vote and the mail-in vote it was going to take a while. We’re going to have to be patient until the hard work of tallying the votes is finished. And it ain’t over until every vote is counted, every ballot is counted. But we’re feeling good. We’re feeling good about where we are. We believe one of the nets has suggested we’ve already won Arizona, but we’re confident about Arizona. That’s a turnaround. We also just called it for Minnesota. And we’re still in the game in Georgia, although that’s not one we expected. And we’re feeling real good about Wisconsin and Michigan. And by the way, it’s going to take time to count the votes, we’re going to win Pennsylvania. I’ve been talking to the folks in Philly, Allegheny County, Scranton, and they’re really encouraged by the turnout and what they see. Look, we can know the results as early as tomorrow morning. But it may take a little longer. As I’ve said all along, it’s not my place or Donald Trump’s place to declare who’s won this election. That’s the decision of the American people. But I’m optimistic about this outcome. And I want to thank everyone of you who came out and voted in this election. And by the way, Chris Coons and the Democrats, congratulations here in Delaware. John Carney. Hey John, you’re the gov. Yeah, the whole team man. You’ve done a great job. I’m grateful to the poll workers, to our volunteers, our canvassers, everyone that participated in this democratic process. And I’m grateful to all of my supporters here in Delaware and all across the nation. Thank you, thank you, thank you. And folks, you heard me say it before, every time I walk out of my grandpa’s house up in Scranton he’d yell, “Joey. Keep the faith.” And my Grandma, when she was alive, “Y’all know Joey spread it.” Keep the faith guys, we’re going to win this. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Your patience is great."
"143","11-05-20"," Senator Harris and I just completed briefings on both COVID and the economic crisis facing this nation, and we’re reminded again of the severity of this pandemic. Cases are on the rise nationwide and we’re nearing 240,000 deaths due to COVID, and our hearts go out to each and every family has lost a loved one to this terrible disease. In America, the vote is sacred. It’s how people of this nation express their will, and it is the will of the voters, no one, not anything else, that chooses the President of the United States of America. So each ballot must be counted and that’s what we’re going to see going through now, and that’s how it should be. Democracy is sometimes messy. It sometimes requires a little patience as well, but that patience has been rewarded now for more than 240 years with a system of governance, and that’s been the envy of the world, and we continue to feel, senator and I, we continue to feel very good about where things stand. We have no doubt that when the count is finished, Senator Harris and I will be declared the winners. So I ask everyone to stay calm, all people to stay calm. The process is working. The count is being completed and we’ll know very soon. So thank you all for your patience, but we’ve got to count the votes. God bless you all and may God protect our troops. Thank you so much."
"144","11-07-20"," Good evening. Good evening. Good evening. Thank you. Thank you. Good evening. Thank you. Good evening. So Congressman John Lewis, Congressman John Lewis, before his passing, wrote, “Democracy is not a state. It is an act.” What he meant was that America’s democracy is not guaranteed. It is only as strong as our willingness to fight for it, to guard it and never take it for granted. Protecting our democracy takes struggle, it takes sacrifice, but there is joy in it and there is progress, because we, the people, have the power to build a better future. When our very democracy was on the ballot in this election, with the very soul of America at stake, and the world watching, you ushered in a new day for America. To our campaign staff and volunteers, this extraordinary team, thank you for bringing more people than ever before into the democratic process and for making this victory possible. To the poll workers and election officials across our country, who have worked tirelessly to make sure every vote is counted, our nation owes you a debt of gratitude. You have protected the integrity of our democracy. And to the American people who make up our beautiful country, thank you for turning out in record numbers to make your voices heard. I know times have been challenging, especially the last several months, the grief, sorrow, and pain, the worries and the struggles, but we have also witnessed your courage, your resilience, and the generosity of your spirit. For four years, you marched and organized for equality and justice for our lives and for our planet. Then you voted and you delivered a clear message. You chose hope and unity, decency, science, and, yes, truth. You chose Joe Biden as the next president of the United States of America. Joe is a healer, a uniter, a tested and steady hand, a person whose own experience of loss gives him a sense of purpose that will help us as a nation reclaim our own sense of purpose, and a man with a big heart who loves with abandon. It’s his love for Jill, who will be an incredible First Lady. It’s his love for Hunter and Ashley and his grandchildren and the entire Biden family. While I first knew Joe as vice president, I really got to know him as the father who loved Beau, my dear friend who we remember here today. And to my husband Doug and our children Cole and Ella and my sister Maya and our whole family, I love you all more than I can ever express. We are so grateful to Joe and Jill for welcoming our family into theirs on this incredible journey. And to the woman most responsible for my presence here today, my mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, who is always in our hearts. When she came here from India at the age of 19, she maybe didn’t quite imagine this moment. But she believed so deeply, and in America, where a moment like this is possible. And so, I am thinking about her and about the generations of women, Black women, Asian, white, Latina, Native American women who, throughout our nation’s history, have paved the way for this moment tonight, women who fought and sacrificed so much for equality and liberty and justice for all, including the Black women who are often too often overlooked, but so often prove they are the backbone of our democracy. All the women who have worked to secure and protect the right to vote for over a century, 100 years ago with the 19th Amendment, 55 years ago with the Voting Rights Act, and now in 2020 with a new generation of women in our country who cast their ballots and continue the fight for their fundamental right to vote and be heard. Tonight I reflect on their struggle, their determination, and the strength of their vision to see what can be unburdened by what has been. I stand on their shoulders. What a testament it is to Joe’s character, that he had the audacity to break one of the most substantial barriers that exist in our country and select a woman as his vice president. But while I may be the first woman in this office, I will not be the last, because every little girl watching tonight sees that this is a country of possibilities. To the children of our country, regardless of your gender, our country has sent you a clear message: dream with ambition, lead with conviction, and see yourselves in a way that others may not, simply because they’ve never seen it before. But know that we will applaud you every step of the way. And to the American people, no matter who you voted for, I will strive to be a vice president like Joe was to President Obama, loyal, honest, and prepared, waking up every day thinking of you and your family, because now is when the real work begins, the hard work, the necessary work, the good work, the essential work to save lives and beat this epidemic, to rebuild our economy so it works for working people, to root out systemic racism in our justice system and society, to combat the climate crisis, to unite our country and heal the soul of our nation. The road ahead will not be easy, but America is ready, and so are Joe and I. We have elected a president who represents the best in us, a leader the world will respect and our children will look up to, a commander-in-chief who will respect our troops and keep our country safe, and a president for all Americans. And it is now my great honor to introduce the President-elect of the United States of America, Joe Biden. Hello, my fellow Americans and the people who brought me to dance, Delawareans. I see my buddy Senator Tom Carper down there and I think Senator Coons is there and I think the governor’s around. And now former governor Ruth Ann Minner. Most importantly, my sisters-in-law and my sister Valerie. Anyway, folks, the people of this nation have spoken. They’ve delivered us a clear victory, a convincing victory, a victory for we the people. We’ve won with the most votes ever cast for a presidential ticket in the history of the nation, 74 million. Well, I must admit it surprised me. Tonight, we’ve seen all over this nation, all cities in all parts of the country, indeed across the world, an outpouring of joy, of hope, renewed faith, and tomorrow bring a better day. I’m humbled by the trust and confidence you’ve placed in me. I pledge to be a president who seeks not to divide but unify, who doesn’t see red states and blue states, only sees the United States, and work with all my heart, with the confidence of the whole people, to win the confidence of all of you. For that is what America, I believe, is about. It’s about people. And that’s what our administration will be all about. I sought this office to restore the soul of America, to rebuild the backbone of this nation, the middle class, and to make America respected around the world again and to unite us here at home. It’s the honor of my lifetime that so many millions of Americans have voted for that vision. Now the work of making that vision is real. It’s a task, the task, of our time. Folks, as I said many times before, I’m Jill’s husband, and I would not be here without her love and tireless support of Jill, and my son Hunter and Ashley, my daughter, and all our grandchildren and their spouses and all our family. They’re in my heart. Jill’s a mom, a military mom, an educator. She’s dedicated her life to education. But teaching isn’t just what she does. It’s who she is. For American educators, this is a great day for you all. You’re going to have one of your own in the White House. Jill’s going to make a great First Lady. I’m so proud of her. I’ll have the honor of serving with a fantastic vice president. You just heard from Kamala Harris, who makes history as the first woman, first Black woman, the first woman from South Asian descent, the first daughter of immigrants ever elected in this country. Don’t tell me it’s not possible in the United States. It’s long overdue. We’re reminded tonight of those who fought so hard for so many years to make this happen. But once again, America’s bent the arc of the moral universe, more toward justice. Kamala, Doug, like it or not, you’re family. You’ve become an honorary Biden. There’s no way out. To all those of you who volunteered and worked the polls in the middle of this pandemic, local elected officials, you deserve a special thanks from the entire nation. To my campaign team and all the volunteers, and all who gave so much of themselves to make this moment possible, I owe you. I owe you. I owe you everything. All those who supported us, I’m proud of the campaign we built and ran. I’m proud of the coalition we put together, the broadest and most diverse coalition in history. Democrats, Republicans, independents, progressives, moderates, conservatives, young, old, urban, suburban, rural, gay, straight, transgender, white, Latino, Asian, Native American. I mean it, especially in those moments and especially for those moments when this campaign was at its lowest ebb, the African American community stood up again for me. You’ve always had my back, and I’ll have yours. I said at the outset I wanted this campaign to represent and look like America. We’ve done that. Now that’s what I want the administration to look like and act like. For all those of you who voted for President Trump, I understand the disappointment tonight. I’ve lost a couple of times myself. But now let’s give each other a chance. It’s time to put away the harsh rhetoric, lower the temperature, see each other again, listen to each other again. To make progress, we have to stop treating our opponents as our enemies. They are not our enemies. They’re Americans. They’re Americans. The Bible tells us to everything, there’s a season, a time to build, a time to reap and a time to sow, and a time to heal. This is the time to heal in America. Now this campaign is over, what is the will of people? What is our mandate? I believe it’s this: American have called upon us to marshal the forces of decency, the forces of fairness, to marshal the forces of science and the forces of hope in the great battles of our time, the battle to control the virus, the battle to build prosperity, the battle to secure your family’s healthcare, the battle to achieve racial justice and root out systemic racism in this country. And the battle to save our planet by getting climate under control. The battle to restore decency, defend democracy, and give everybody in this country a fair shot. That’s all they’re asking for: a fair shot. Folks, our work begins with getting COVID under control. We cannot repair the economy, restore our vitality, or relish life’s most precious moments, hugging our grandchildren, our children on our birthdays, weddings, graduations, all the moments that matter most to us until we get it under control. On Monday, I will name a group of leading scientists and experts as transition advisors, to help take the Biden-Harris COVID plan and convert it into an action blueprint that will start on January the 20th, 2021. That plan will be built on bedrock science. It will be constructed out of compassion, empathy, and concern. I will spare no effort, none, or any commitment to turn around this pandemic. Folks, I’m a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president. I’ll work as hard for those who didn’t vote for me as those who did. Let this grim era of demonization in America begin to end here and now. The refusal of Democrats and Republicans to cooperate with one another is not some mysterious force beyond our control, it’s a decision, a choice we make. If we can decide not to cooperate, then we can decide to cooperate. I believe that this is part of the mandate given to us from the American people. They want us to cooperate in their interests, and that’s the choice I’ll make. I’ll call on Congress, Democrats and Republicans alike, to make that choice with me. The American story is about slow yet steadily widening the opportunities in America. Make no mistake, too many dreams have been deferred for too long. We must make the promise of the country real for everybody, no matter their race, their ethnicity, their faith, their identity, or their disability. Folks, America has always been shaped by inflection points by moments in time where we’ve made hard decisions about who we are and what we want to be: Lincoln in 1860 coming to save the union, FDR in 1932 promising a beleaguered country a new deal, JFK in 1960 pledging a new frontier, and 12 years ago when Barack Obama made history and told us, yes, we can. Well, folks, we stand at an inflection point. We have an opportunity to defeat despair, to build a nation of prosperity and purpose. We can do it. I know we can. I’ve long talked about the battle for the soul of America. We must restore the soul of America. Our nation is shaped by the constant battle between our better angels and our darkest impulses, and what presidents say in this battle matters. It’s time for our better angels to prevail. Tonight, the whole world is watching America, and I believe, at our best, America is a beacon for the globe. We will lead not only by the example of our power, but by the power of our example. I know I’ve always believed, and many of you heard me say it, I’ve always believed we can define America in one word: possibilities. That in America everyone should be given an opportunity to go as far as their dreams and God-given ability will take them. You see, I believe in the possibilities of this country. We’re always looking ahead, ahead to an America that’s freer and more just, ahead to an America that creates jobs with dignity and respect, ahead to an America that cures diseases like cancer and Alzheimer’s, ahead to an America that never leaves anyone behind, ahead to an America that never gives up, never gives in. This is a great nation. It’s always been a bad bet to bet against America. We’re good people. This is the United States of America. There’s never been anything, never been anything, we’ve been not able to do when we’ve done it together. Folks, in the last days of the campaign, I began thinking about a hymn that means a lot to me and my family, particularly my deceased son, Beau. It captures the faith that sustains me and which I believe sustains America. I hope, and I hope, we can provide some comfort and solace to the 230,000 Americans who’ve lost a loved one due to this terrible virus this year. My heart goes out to each and every one of you. Hopefully this hymn gives you solace as well. It goes like this. “And he will raise you up on eagle’s wings, bear you on the breath of dawn, and make you just shine like the sun, and hold you in the palm of His hand.” Now together on eagle’s wings, we embark on the work that God and history have called upon us to do. With full hearts and steady hands, with faith in America and in each other, with love of country, a thirst for justice, let us be the nation that we know we can be, a nation united, a nation strengthened, a nation healed, the United States of America. Ladies and gentlemen, there’s never, never, been anything we’ve tried we’ve not been able to do. Remember, as my grandpappy said when I walked out of his home, when I was a kid up in Scranton, he said, “Joey, keep the faith.” And our grandmother, when she was alive, she yelled, “No, Joey. Spread it. Spread the faith. God love you all. May God bless America and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you."
"145","11-09-20"," As I said on Saturday, I’m humbled by the trust this country and the American people have placed in me and Vice President Elect Harris. And we’re ready to get to work, addressing the needs of the American people. Today our work begins. It starts with doing everything possible to get the COVID-19 under control so that we can reopen our businesses safely and sustainably, resume our lives and put this pandemic behind us. And we just received positive news in this fight, announcement of progress made for a successful vaccine. Soon, expectation will run the process of [inaudible 00:00:47] and approvals. And the process results must also be grounded in science and fully transparent so the American people can have every confidence in any approved vaccine is safe and effective. At the same time, it’s clear that this vaccine, even if approved will not be widely available for many months yet to come. The challenge before us right now is still immense and growing. And although we are not in office yet, I’m just laying out what we expect to do and hope can be done, some of it between now and the time we are sworn in. So the purpose of this is to let you know what we’re going to do once sworn in. There’s a need for bold action to fight this pandemic. We’re still facing a very dark winter. There are now nearly 10 million COVID cases in the United States. Last week we topped 120,000 new cases on multiple successive days. Infection rates are going up. Hospitalizations are going up. Deaths are going up. This crisis claimed nearly a thousand American lives a day, nearly 240,000 deaths so far. The projections still indicate we could lose 200,000 more lives in the coming months before a vaccine can be made widely available. So we can’t forego the important work that needs to be done between now and then to get our country through the worst wave yet in this pandemic, to reduce the spread, to save lives. So that’s why today I’ve named the COVID-19 Transition Advisory Board comprised of distinguished public health experts to help our transition team translate the Biden-Harris COVID-19 plan into action. A blueprint that we can put in place as soon as Kamala and I are sworn into office on January 20th, 2021. And we will seek to add other members to this board to bring additional important perspective on public health and expertise throughout the transition. This group will advise on detailed plans, built on a bedrock of science and to keep compassion, empathy and care for every American at its core, making rapid testing widely available… More widely available, much more widely available, and building a core of contact tracers who will track and curb this disease while we prioritize getting vaccines first to the most at risk populations, developing clear and detailed guidance, providing the necessary resources for small businesses, schools, childcare centers to reopen and operate safely and effectively during the pandemic, protecting both workers and the public, scaling up productive lifesaving treatments and therapeutics. And when it’s ready, making sure an approved vaccine is distributed equitably and efficiently and free for every American. With cases rising once more, it’s imperative that we ramp up our production of personal protective equipment, to make sure our brave healthcare workers have what they need to do battle safely against this virus. We’re going to get states, cities and tribes, the test and the supplies they need. We’re going to protect vulnerable populations who are at risk, most at risk from this virus, older Americans and those with preexisting conditions. We’re going to address the health and economic disparities that mean this virus is hitting the Black, Latino, Asian American, Pacific Islanders, Native American communities, harder than white communities. Focusing on in these communities is one of our priorities, not an afterthought. The bottom line, I will spare no effort to turn this pandemic around once we’re sworn in on January 20th, to get our kids back to school safely, our businesses growing, and our economy running at full speed again, and to get an approved vaccine manufactured and distributed as quickly as possible to as many Americans as possible free of charge. We’ll follow the science, we’ll follow the science. Let me say that again. And we’ll adjust the new data when it comes in and we’ll listen and work in cooperation with governors and local leaders of both parties who are fighting this virus in their communities this very day. There is so much good work happening at state and local levels across the country, governors, mayors, they’re stepping up. The advisory board will listen and learn lessons from their experience. Because we know that we won’t fully defeat COVID-19 until we defeat it everywhere, my advisory council also includes experts on global health security so that we can restore U.S. global leadership to fight this pandemic. This is a crisis that affects everyone. As I’ve said throughout this campaign, I will be a president for every American. This election is over. It’s time to put aside the partisanship and the rhetoric that designed to demonize one another. It’s time to end the politicization of basic responsible public health steps like mask wearing and social distancing. We have to come together to heal the soul of this country so that we can effectively address this crisis, as one country, where hardworking Americans have each other’s backs. And where we’re united in our shared goal, defeating this virus. As we work toward a safe and effective vaccine, we know that the single most effective thing we can do to stop the spread of COVID is wear a mask. The head of the CDC warned this fall, that for the foreseeable future, a mask remains the most potent weapon against the virus. Today’s news does not change that urgent reality. I won’t be president until January 20th, but my message today is to everyone, is this, it doesn’t matter who you voted for, where you stood before election day, it doesn’t matter your party, your point of view, we can save tens of thousands of lives if everyone would just wear a mask for the next few months. Not Democrat or Republican lives, American lives. Maybe we’d save a life of a person who stocks the shelf at your local grocery store. Maybe saves the life of a member of your place of worship. Maybe saves the lives of one of your children’s teachers. Maybe saves your life. So please, I implore you, wear a mask, do it for yourself, do it for your neighbor. A mask is not a political statement, but it is a good way to start pulling the country together. I want to be very clear, the goal of mask wearing is not to make your life less comfortable or take something away from you. It’s to give something back to all of us, a normal life. The goal is to get back to normal as fast as possible and masks are critical in doing that. It won’t be forever, but that’s how we’ll get our nation back, back up to speed economically. So we can go back to celebrating birthdays and holidays together. So we can attend sporting events together. So we can get back to the lives and connections we shared before the pandemic. It doesn’t matter whether or not we always agree with one another. It doesn’t matter who you voted for. We are Americans and our country is under threat. We’re now called to do the same thing that generations of proud Americans have done when faced with a crisis throughout our history. Rise above our differences to Defend the strength and the vitality of our nation. That’s the character of patriots, that’s the character of America. We have to do this together. Wearing a mask seems like a small act. Maybe you think your individual choice won’t make any difference. Throughout our history, throughout the history of our nation, we’ve seen over and over how small acts add up to enormous achievements. It’s the weight of many small acts together that bend the arc of history. I know there’s nothing that the American people can’t accomplish when we work together, as one people, with one mission. We can get this virus under control, I promise you. We can rebuild our economy back better than it was before. We can address race based disparities that damage our country. It’s in our power. So let’s wear a mask. Let’s get to work. Thank you. May God bless you. And for all those who have lost somebody, our heart goes out to you. We know what it’s like. Our heart goes out to you. May God protect our healthcare workers and all Americans. Thank you."
"146","11-10-20"," Good afternoon. Today, the Supreme Court heard arguments in a case that could strike down the Affordable Care Act in its entirety. If the Supreme Court agrees with the opponents of the act, their decision could take healthcare away from 20 million Americans. It could take away protections from more than 100 million people with pre-existing conditions in our country, and hurt the millions of Americans who have come to rely on the Affordable Care Act. Getting rid of the Affordable Care Act will take us backwards to a time when people could charge a woman more for her healthcare than they could charge a man simply because she’s a woman, to a time when pregnancy could be considered a preexisting condition. It will take away free birth control and contraceptive coverage for women. This is all happening at a moment when our country is suffering through a pandemic that has claimed more than 238,000 lives. And we all know that if the Affordable Care Act is struck down, communities of color would be hit particularly hard: black, Asian, Hispanic, and native American, because they are at a greater risk of pre-existing conditions from asthma to diabetes, to lupus. And they are also three times as likely to contract COVID-19, and twice as likely to die as others. Now, I know we all know that we just had an election in America, an election where healthcare was very much on the ballot. Our country had a clear choice in this election. Each and every vote for Joe Biden was a statement that healthcare in America should be a right and not a privilege. Each and every vote for Joe Biden was a vote to protect and expand the Affordable Care Act, not to tear it away in the midst of a global pandemic. And Joe Biden won the election decisively with more votes than have ever been cast in American history. It amounts to 75 million voices and counting, calling on the Supreme Court to see this case for what it is: a blatant attempt to overturn the will of the people. And the president-elect and I cannot let that happen. And now it is my honor to introduce President-Elect, Joe Biden. Thank you, Kamala. Good afternoon, everyone. This morning, as was stated, United States Supreme Court heard oral arguments on the case of grave importance to the American people. This case represents the latest attempt by the far-right ideologues to do what they’ve repeatedly failed to do for a long time in the courts and the Congress and the Court of Public Opinion over the last decade to eliminate the entirety of the Affordable Care Act. Twice already the Supreme Court has upheld the landmark law. In 2012, and again in 2015, and the Congress expressing the popular will of the American people on a bipartisan basis has rejected numerous attempts, numerous efforts by president Trump to erase the law as well. Now, in the middle of a deadly pandemic that has infected more than 10 million Americans, nearly one in every 32 Americans, often with devastating consequences to their health, these ideologues are once again trying to strip health coverage away from the American people. The goal of the outgoing administration is clear from the brief they filed in the Supreme Court. It asserts, and I quote, “The entire ACA thus must fall.” End of quote. Now, I’m not naive about the fact that healthcare is an issue that has divided Americans in the past, but the truth is the American people are more united on this issue today than they are divided. Recently as last month, a leading survey found that American people want to keep the Affordable Care Act in place by an overwhelming margin of 58% to 36%. 79% of the American people, including nine out of 10 Democrats, eight out of 10 independents, and two thirds of republicans want to keep the ACA protections for people with pre-existing conditions, which would be eliminated if this lawsuit were to succeed. This doesn’t need to be a partisan issue. It’s a human issue. It affects every single American family. We can’t subvert the growing consensus of the American people based on an argument put forward in the briefs seeking to invalidate the law that even many conservative legal scholars, including in a national review considered to be, “ridiculous.” Let’s be absolutely clear about what’s at stake. The consequences of the Trump administration’s argument are not academic or an abstraction. For many Americans, they’re a matter of life and death in a literal sense. This argument will determine whether healthcare coverage of more than 20 million Americans who acquired under the Affordable Care Act will be ripped away in the middle of the nation’s worst pandemic in a century. Over 100 million people, as the vice president-elect pointed out. Over 100 million people with pre-existing conditions like asthma, diabetes, cancer could once again be denied coverage, whether complications from COVID-19 like lung scarring and heart damage will be the next flood of preexisting conditions that could be used as an excuse to jack up premiums or deny coverage altogether. For millions of survivors who have struggled, won and fought the coronavirus, fought against the loss of their life. This argument is going to determine whether women, as is pointed out, will once again be charged higher premiums, just because they’re women, or seniors will see their prescription drug costs go up. And like kids whether or not they can stay on their parents’ plan, til age 26, whether annual lifetime benefits will be reimposed, so someone can walk in and say, “Die in peace. You’re run out of your coverage. This ain’t hyperbole. It’s real. As real as it gets when a family is faced with the awful news of a child’s diagnosis of leukemia or a mom forced to battle against breast cancer, an accident that leaves loved ones unable to live the life they’ve always known. It stops your heart. It stops your heart and wrenches your entire world right off its axis when that happens. And many of you know that from your own personal experiences. Believe me, I know the feeling, and too many American families do as well. And that moment, the very last thing on your mind, the very last thing that should be on your mind, is whether you can afford the treatment. The Affordable Care Act was created to put a stop to that inhumanity. It was created to ensure that families, thrust into their worst nightmare of their lives, could focus not on money, but on the fight that really matters. Obama Care is a law that every American should be proud of. It’s why people with pre-existing conditions are protected in this country. It’s a law that delivered vital coverage, as I said before, for 20 million Americans that did not have coverage. It’s a law that reduced prescription drug price costs for nearly 12 million seniors. It’s a law that save lives and spared countless families from financial ruin. So, this effort to bypass the will of the American people, the verdict of the courts in the past, the judgments of Congress, in my view is simply cruel and needlessly divisive. Regardless of the outcome of this case, I promise you this: beginning on January 20th, the vice president-elect Harris and I, we’re going to do everything in our power to ease the burden of healthcare on you and your families. I promise you that. As I said, I will protect your healthcare like I protect… as my own family, and we’ve been unfortunately significant consumers of healthcare. That starts by building on the Affordable Care Act. With the dramatic expansion of healthcare coverage and bold steps to lower healthcare costs, my transition team will soon be starting its work to flesh out the details so that we can hit the ground running, tackling costs, increasing access, lowering the price of prescription drugs. Families are reeling right now. Particularly the reporters in this room and others listening, you’ve interviewed a lot of these people around the country as you’ve gone all over the world, all over the country. Enduring illness is faced with risky choices, losing their employer plans in droves. Over 10 million have already lost their employer plans. They need a lifeline, and they need it now. They shouldn’t have to hold their breath, they shouldn’t be in that position. Waiting to see if the Supreme Court is going to wrench away the peace of mind they’ve come to now rely on. We’re going to get right to work. I promise you. Addressing the issues that families are talking about around the kitchen tables this morning, making sure that they can get in bed tonight with the peace of mind that they deserve, and fulfilling our moral obligation to ensure that here in America healthcare is a right for all, not a privileged for a few. So, come January, we’re going to work quickly with the Congress to dramatically ramp up healthcare protections, get Americans universal coverage, lower healthcare costs as soon as humanly possible. That’s the promise I make to you. We’re going to fight for your family’s health coverage the same way we fight for our own family’s health coverage. We want every single American to know if you’re sick, if you’re struggling, if you’re worried about how you’re going to get going to get through the day, we will not abandon you. That is a promise. We’ll not leave you to face these challenges alone. We’re going to get through this. We’re going to get through it together. And we’re going to build a healthcare system that puts you and your families first, and that every American can be proud of. I want to thank you all for listening. May God bless you. May God keep you safe in this COVID environment, and may God protect our troops. Sure. [inaudible 00:11:41]. [inaudible 00:11:41]. Okay. Thank you, Mr. President-elect. During the campaign, you said you were not naïve about how difficult it would be to unite the country. It’s now three days after you were projected as the president-elect, the president himself says he has won this election, his own administration has not moved forward to give you access to what you need to do to begin the work of your transition. Just a few minutes ago, The Secretary of State, when asked if he would cooperate with a smooth transition, he said, “There will be a smooth transition to a second Trump administration. Well, first of all, we’re already beginning the transition. We’re well underway. And the ability for the administration in any way, by failure to recognize our win, there’s not a change to the dynamic at all in what we’re able to do. We’ve announced yesterday, as you know, the health group we put together. Today, we’re going to be going, moving along in a consistent manner, putting together our administration in the White House and reviewing who we’re going to pick for the cabinet positions. And nothing’s going to stop that. So, I’m confident that the fact that they’re not willing to acknowledge we won at this point is not of much consequence in our planning and what we’re able to do between now and January 20th. You’ve a response to Secretary Pompeo? And I’m also wondering you warned during the campaign that as the walls closed in on the president, he would behave more erotically. Yesterday, he fired his defense secretary on Twitter. Well, first of all, I’m letting them know that America is back. We’re going to be back in the game. It’s not American alone. Number one, I’ve had the opportunity to speak with now six world leaders and the response has been very fulsome, energetic, and they’re all looking forward to being able to, from Great Britain, to France, Germany, to Canada, et cetera, and Ireland. So, I feel good about the ability to… I said when we announced that the next president is going to inherit a divided country and a world in disarray, the reception and welcome we’ve gotten around the world from our allies and our friends has been real, and I have a number of other calls to return, and so I feel confident that we’re going to be able to put America back in the place of respect that it had before. Thank you, sir. Mr. President elect, senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, has suggested today that he may not recognize the outcome of this election until the electoral college meets next month. Have you spoken to your long time friend in the Senate, Mr. I haven’t had a chance to speak to Mitch. My expectation is that I will do that, not too distant future. I think that the whole Republican Party has been put in a position, with a few notable exceptions, of being mildly intimidated by the sitting president. But there’s only one president at a time. He’s president, we’re going to have a electoral college will be making their judgment in December. It’ll be announced in early January. But in the meantime, I hope to get a chance to speak to Mitch. I’d like to follow up. We can get through without the funding. We’re in a position that we feel very good about our… there’s nothing that slows up our efforts to put things together. Obviously, the PDB would be useful, but it’s not necessary. I’m not the sitting president now. And so we don’t see anything as slowing us down, quite frankly. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President-elect, and congratulations to you both. Mr. President, I look forward to speaking with you. And you say that you are being able to move ahead without interruption, but to Jeff’s point, presumably at some point you will need access to more classified information to secure facilities and the like. Well, look, access to classified information is useful, but I’m not on a position to make any decisions on those issues anyway. There’s one, as I said, one president at a time and he will be president until January 20th. It would be nice to have it, but it’s not critical. So, we’re just going to proceed the way we have. We’re going to do exactly what we’d be doing if he had conceded and said we’ve won, which we have, and so there’s nothing really changing. No, I don’t see a need for legal action, quite frankly. I think the legal action is you’re seeing it play out with the actions he’s taking. And so far there is no evidence of any of the assertions made by the president or Secretary of State, Pompeo. Secretary of State Pompeo. Thank you, Mr. President-elect. Democrats are on track to lose a handful of seats in the House of Representatives, that could make it harder to pass legislation with just democratic votes. Well, I’ve spoken to the Leader and I’ve spoken to the minority Leader in the House. And one of the urgent things that need to be done is people need relief right now. Right now. Small businesses, people who are about to be evicted from their homes because they can’t pay their mortgage, unemployment insurance. What’s going to happen is you’re going to see… what people don’t realize is the failure to provide state and local assistance, you’re going to see police officers, firefighters, first responders laid off. And I think the pressure is going to bill. But the fact is that I would hope that the president at least has the sensitivity and knowledge to know that a lot of people are in real trouble right now, between now and the time we get elected, that we get sworn in. And so it’s my hope and expectation, I’m sure that the Speaker of the House, as well as the Minority Leader, are working right now with the priorities they have laid out. Well, we’ve been talking and they know my views, and I support what they’re doing. And then my second question was about the Senate. Obviously, it’d be much better if we had a tie in the Senate, which means that [inaudible 00:20:29] vice president become incredibly important beyond what she already is, but we’re going to do anything we can that they think we can do to help. No, I don’t think so. I take McConnell at his word. I understand he said that he will make it clear who he’s prepared to support, not support, and that’s a negotiation that I’m sure we’ll have. Look, one of the things that I would do as president-elect and when I become president is layout to Republicans, as well as the Democrats, who we intend to name for each cabinet position. I hope we’re able to be in a position to let people know at least a couple that we want before Thanksgiving. And we’ll just work this out. Look, I am not a pessimist, as you know, and I think there are enough Republicans who’ve already spoken out, and I think there’ll be many more… Not many more, there’ll be a larger number once the election is declared and I’m sworn in, to be able to get things done. I think they understand. For example, I can’t imagine there not being a willingness on the part of Republicans. There’s going to be significant pressure to deal with healthcare. Their own constituencies are in that position. I think we can get a lot done. Thank you. Okay. We’ll have one last question [inaudible 00:22:05]. Well, I just think it’s an embarrassment, quite frankly. The only thing that… How can I say this tactfully? I think it will not help the president’s legacy. I think that I know from my discussions with foreign leaders thus far that they are hopeful that United States’ democratic institutions are viewed once again as being strong and endured. But I think at the end of the day, it’s all going to come to fruition on January 20th, and between now and then my hope and expectation is that the American people do know and do understand that there has been a transition. Even among Republicans who are people who voted for the president, I understand the sense of loss. I get that. But I think the majority of the people who voted for the president, a lot voted for him, a significantly smaller number, but a lot voted for him, I think they understand that we have to come together. I think they’re ready to unite and I believe we can pull the country out of this bitter politics that we’ve seen for the last last five, six, seven years. They will. They will. Thank you all so very much. [inaudible 00:23:57]. Thank you. Thank you, guys. [crosstalk 00:24:06] take it."
"147","11-16-20"," Good afternoon. President-Elect Biden and I just met with some of our nation’s business and union leaders. Together, they represent millions of workers across our country and some of America’s leading technology, auto, and retail companies. We had an important conversation about the impact that this pandemic has had on workers, especially essential workers, frontline workers who have risked their own health and the health of their families, and many whom have given their own lives to keep us safe and keep our economy running. And we all know that this pandemic and this recession have hit communities of color particularly hard. Black Americans and Latinos are three times as likely to contract COVID as others and more likely to die. Native Americans are more than four times as likely to be hospitalized as others. And last month, the unemployment rate for Black Americans was almost twice the rate of others. And we have also had a conversation about the impact this pandemic has had on our economy as a whole, from the Fortune 500 to the small businesses that so many communities rely on. Over the past few months on the campaign trail, the president-elect and I saw that impact firsthand. In state after state, we met with workers who shared their struggles and told us about their pain. Essential workers who have had to stay on the job, even as they worry about their family’s well-being and their own. Small business owners, who are dipping into their own savings to make payroll and keep their doors open. And many others who have had to close their doors and fear never reopening at all. Their stories have stayed with us, and the president-elect and I are focused on building our country back better for them and all Americans. And as I said the night we won this election, now is when the real work begins, the necessary work, the good work of getting this virus under control, saving lives, and beating this pandemic and opening our economy responsibly, while rebuilding it, so that it works for working people. And we will do it by protecting the health and safety of our workers and creating millions of good-paying union jobs from auto and construction jobs, to domestic workers and caregiving jobs, to service and hospitality jobs. The road ahead, it will not be easy, but the president-elect and I are hitting the ground running because we all know the challenges facing America today are great. The American people deserve no less, and we don’t have a moment to waste. And now, it is my incredible and great honor to introduce our President-Elect Joe Biden. Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Vice President Harris and I, as she indicated, just met with a group of America’s top business leaders and labor leaders. And I must tell you, it reinforced what I thought from the beginning – we’re ready to come together. The unity was astounding. I want to go back and talk about the people who actually participated in that. I’m going to list all the people, just so you know who we spoke with. Number one, there was Mary Barra, CEO of General Motors, Brian Cornell, CEO of Target, Mr. Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, Rory Gamble, president of the UAW, Mary Kay Henry, president SCIU, Mark Perrone, president of the UFCW, Lee Saunders, president of AFSCME and Sonia Syngal, president of Gap, Richard Trumka president of the AFL-CIO. It was really encouraging, quite frankly, to get people, business and labor, together agreeing on the way forward, which I’m convinced the American people will rally to do when they hear what we have in mind. And I’m very pleased it all came together around the same table to advance areas of common ground. And we agreed we’re going to continue these conversations. They represent very different perspectives, but I’m convinced that we can all come together around the same table to advance areas of common ground, which are really, I wish you could have all heard the conversation. It was really encouraging, and that’s what we were ready to discuss today. We all agreed that we want to get the economy back on track. We need our workers to be back on the job by getting the virus under control. We’re going in a very dark winter. Things are going to get much tougher before they get easier. And that requires sparing no effort to fight COVID so that we can open our businesses safely, resume our lives and put this pandemic behind us. It’s going to be difficult, but it can be done. And they all agreed that means rallying the country behind a national strategy with robust public health measures like mandatory masking, widely available testing with rapid results, scaled up production of life-saving treatments and therapeutics, and safe, equitable, and free distribution of the vaccine. It’s great news that Moderna and Pfizer have each come up with vaccines that are in excess of 90% effectiveness. And getting the vaccine and a vaccination, though, are two different things. Everyone on our call today, in our Zoom today, agreed that the sooner we have access to the administration’s distribution plan, the sooner this transition would be smoothly, move forward. And you know, as we battle COVID what have to make sure that business and workers have the tools, the resources, the national guidance and health and safety standards to operate safely. And we can do that. We can bring Democrats and Republicans together, work with business and labor to deliver those necessary resources. And for millions of Americans who’ve lost hours and wages, or have lost their jobs, we all agreed on our call that we can deliver immediate relief and it need be done quickly. Affordable healthcare for millions of people who have lost it, or are in danger of losing it. Childcare, sick leave, family leave, so workers don’t have to choose between work and family. Corporate America agreed on this today, the folks on the call. We need to support small businesses and entrepreneurs that are the backbone of our communities but are teetering on the edge. And we all agreed on the urgent need for funding for States and localities to keep frontline workers and essential workers on the job, vital public services, running law enforcement offices, educators, first responders, like we did with The Recovery Act of 2009, saving literally millions of jobs. There’s a reason why the federal government is able to run a deficit. Because the States must, must balance their budgets. And they’re in real trouble. You’re going to see hundreds of thousands of police officers, firefighters, first responders, mental health clinics, you’re going to see them going out of business. Right now, Congress should come together and pass a COVID relief package like The Heroes Act that the House passed six months ago. … months ago. Once we shut down the virus and deliver economic relief to workers and businesses, then we can start to build back better than before. We talked about how we have an opportunity to come out of this stronger, more resilient than we were when we went in, and I wish you could have heard corporate leaders and the major labor leaders singing from the same hymnal here. Throughout the campaign, I laid out my Build Back Better plan. We laid out a plan that an independent analysis put out by Moody’s, a well-respected Wall Street firm, projected would create 18.6 million jobs. We talked about the need to own the electric vehicle market. We talked about climate a lot, building 550,000 charging stations, creating over a million good-paying union jobs here at home. The need for a federal government to invest more in clean energy research. It’s based on a simple premise, it’s time to reward work, not just wealth in America. We’re going to have a fair tax structure that makes sure the wealthiest among us and corporations pay their fair share. Our plan will create millions of good-paying union jobs in manufacturing, building the vehicles, products, technologies that we’re going to need for the future to compete with the rest of the world. From autos to our stockpiles, we’re going to buy American. No government contract will be given to companies that don’t make their products here in America. To secure our position as a global leader in research and development, we’re going to invest $300 billion in the most critical, competitive new industries in technologies creating 3 million good-paying jobs. And the corporate American technology firms like Microsoft on the call, they all agreed. We can make sure a future is made here in America. And that’s good for business and it’s good for American workers. We can also modernize infrastructure, roads, bridges, ports. 1.5 million new affordable housing units. High-speed broadband, we talked about, for every American household, which is more important than ever for remote learning, remote working, telemedicine in 21st century. Building a digital infrastructure to help businesses, healthcare workers, first responders and students. A hundred billion dollars to rebuild our crumbling schools. They talked about the need, the business community, talked about the need to invest in HBCUs and community colleges. Retrofitting 4 million new buildings, our old buildings, retrofitting them and making them new. Weatherizing 2 million homes. Building more climate resilient cities and towns. These investments will specifically target communities of colors so we can break the cycle where in good times they lag, and in a bad times, they get hit first and the hardest and in a recovery, it’s the toughest to bounce back. These are the kinds of investments that are going to strengthen our economy and our competitiveness, create millions of jobs, union jobs, and in doing so, respect the dignity of work and empower the voice of workers. You’ve heard me say it before. My dad, when he lost his job in Scranton, eventually moved to Wilmington and got a good job. He’d say, Joey, a job’s about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity, respect, your place in the community. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, honey, everything’s going to be okay. When we build back better, we’ll do so with higher wages, including a $15 minimum wage nationwide, better benefits, stronger collective bargaining rights that you could raise a family on. That’s how we build back the middle-class better than ever. That’s how we make sure workers are treated with the dignity and respect they deserve. I can go on. I can tell I was very encouraged by our conversation, but the point is this: there’s so much we can do. The only way we do any of this is if we work together. I know we can do this. For example, on the call, I made it clear to the corporate leaders. I said, I want you to know I’m a union guy. Unions are going to have increased power. It is not, they understand. It’s not anti-business. It’s about economic growth, creating good-paying jobs. 11 years ago when Barack and I took office during the great recession and implemented the recovery act that saved us from another Great Depression. We didn’t see a map in red and blue states – it was the United States of America. We didn’t care whether the city had voted for us or against us, the state voted for us or against us. We work with everyone and we recovered and rebuilt together as one nation. We can do this again. Refusal of Democrats and republics to cooperate with one another is not due to some mysterious force beyond our control. It’s a conscious decision. It’s a choice that we make. If we can decide not to cooperate, then we can decide to cooperate. I believe this is in part, a mandate for American people. Part of the mandate they gave us. They want us to cooperate. They want us to deliver results. And the choice that Kamala and I will make is that we’re going to do that. That’s why I’m so pleased today we were able to bring together business and labor leaders to make the choice jointly with us. We’re all Americans. Let’s get to work. As I’ve said, many times. Thank you. May God bless you. And may God protect our troops. I understand now I’m going to take some questions, Megan, fire away. Thank you, President-Elect Biden, vice president-elect. I’m looking in the wrong direction, sorry. Good to see you. I’m going to start with a question about your pandemic planning and then a question about your economic plan. You spoke about the need to access the outgoing administration’s COVID vaccine distribution plans. More people may die, if we don’t coordinate. Look, as my chief of staff, Ron Klain would say, who handled Ebola, the vaccine is important. It’s of little use until you’re vaccinated. So how do we get the vaccine? How do we get over 300 million Americans vaccinated? What’s the game plan? It’s a huge, huge, huge undertaking to get it done, prioritize those with greatest need and working our way through it, and also cooperate with the World Health Organization and the rest of the world in dealing with this. And so they say they have this Warp Speed program that the not only dealt with getting vaccines, but also how to distribute this. If we have to wait until January 20th to start that planning, it puts us behind over a month, month and a half. And so it’s important that it be done, that there be coordination now. Now as rapidly as we can get that done. On the economy, the vice president-elect talked about having an economy that works for working people. One thing I didn’t hear you talk specifically about is canceling student loan debt. It does figure in my plan. I’ve laid out in detail. For example, the legislation passed by the democratic house calls for immediate $10,000 forgiveness of student loans. It’s holding people up. They’re in real trouble. They’re having to make choices between paying their student loan and paying the rent, those kinds of decisions. It should be done immediately. In addition to that, as you know, I think that everything from community college straight through to doubling Pell grants, to making sure that we have access to free education for anyone making under $125,000 for four years of college. And there is a program that exists now under the law that forgives student loans for being able to engage in public service. I’m going to institute that fundamental change in that so it’s able to be available to everyone, that in fact, is engaged. It’s not being very well managed right now. So I’m going to do all of those things. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President-elect. … of the President’s continued stonewalling of this transition, but it doesn’t appear that the President is going to come around anytime soon and admit defeat. Deal with every individual organization in the country, from business, to labor, Republicans and Democrats, to try to pull together a serious and consistent plan so we’re ready on day one. Everything from staffing to ultimately naming the cabinet members, to moving along on coordinating with business and labor, the COVID attack, how we’re going to attack COVID. And, so it would make it a lot easier if the President were to participate. You have a number of Republicans suggesting that. The good news here is my colleague is still on the Intelligence Committee, so she gets the intelligence briefings. I don’t anymore. So that is, but there’s a number of Republicans calling for that. I am hopeful that the President will be mildly more enlightened before we get to January 20th. And what is your message to Republicans who are backing up the President’s refusal to concede? You clearly need to work with them going forward. My message is, I will work with you. I understand a lot of your reluctance because of the way the President operates, but I’ve been in contact with and will be in contact with more of them as we move along. And if it has to wait until January 20th to actually become operational, that’s a shame, but maybe that’s the only way to get it done. Thank you very much, Mary. Thank you very much, Mr. President-elect. I want to kind of piggyback off of that. I want to get your thoughts on the President’s tweet over the weekend, where he first seemed to acknowledge that you won, then he said he won’t concede, then he said, “I won. I interpret that as Trumpianism. No change in his modus operandi, and I think the pressure will continue to build. Look, I’m having a lot of meetings with world leaders on the telephone. I can not get into negotiating with them about things that are going to be done, but they’re calling with some degree of enthusiasm. Everyone from our Holy Father to prime ministers across the globe. And so we’re along knowing what the outcome will be, and as I said earlier, and I probably shouldn’t repeat it, but I find this more embarrassing for the country than debilitating for my ability to get started. And then secondly, I want to follow up with you on the vaccine. Well, first of all, we’ll see if that comes forward. And secondly, it’s important that people who are in the greatest need get it. I wouldn’t hesitate to get the vaccine, but I also want to set an example. But I wouldn’t hesitate to get the vaccine if in fact Dr. Fauci and these two organizations, whether it’s Moderna or Pfizer, who have been extremely responsible, conclude that it is safe and able to be done. Look, the only reason people question the vaccine now is because of Donald Trump. That’s the reason why people are questioning the vaccine, because all of the things he says and doesn’t say, whether, “Is it truthful? Is it not truthful?” The exaggerations. I think we’re on a clear path now. We’re on a clear path with the international community and national leaders in the scientific community have focused on these two vaccines. They appear to be ready for prime time, ready to be used, and if that continues on those roads. I would take the vaccine. Thank you. [inaudible 00:22:50]. Thank you, Mr. President-elect. Look, it depends on the state. What I failed to mention earlier is the enormous respect I have for Republican, conservative Republican governors who have stepped up and issued mandates for wearing masks. In North Dakota. One of the leaders in this area has been the Republican Governor in Ohio. And in addition to the folks who have already been leading, like the governor of Michigan, the idea that the President’s now existing remaining advisor on COVID is saying that they should resist. What the hell is the matter with these guys? What is the matter with them? Resist? You know, every major individual of any consequence in the health field is saying, “We can save 100,000 lives just between now and January 21 by wearing these masks.” It’s going to take a while for the vaccine to be able to be available, distributed, and get to people. We’re talking about 350,000 to 400,000 people dying. What are they doing? It’s totally irresponsible. Irresponsible. And so I compliment the governors who’ve stepped forward, who have been stepping forward, but also the Republican governors who stepped forward. I left out the Governor of Utah, very conservative state, Governor of North Dakota, and all the Democratic governors who have been doing it all along. I just ask a rhetorical question. Do you guys understand this? Does anybody understand why a governor would turn this into a political statement? It’s about patriotism. It’s about being patriotic. It’s about saving lives. For real. It’s not hyperbole. It’s about being patriotic. And I think you’re seeing more and more as this god awful virus continues to spread almost unabated that governors are stepping up. Well, here’s what I’d do. Let me tell you what the health experts have said to me. And it’s not because I’m unique and President-elect. It’s because of my family. They strongly urge that if in fact we’re going to have Thanksgiving with anyone, that we limit it to a maximum, maximum, they suggest five people, maximum 10 people, socially distanced, wearing masks. And people who have quarantined. So Jill and I spent this morning, like many of you, trying to figure out, “What are we going to do for Thanksgiving? How are we going to do it?” And we’ve narrowed down which family members, and that they were tested, recently tested, within 24 hours. And so I would strongly urge for the sake, not just your sake, for the sake of your children, your mother, your father, your sisters, your brothers, whoever you get together with at Thanksgiving, think about this. There should be no group more than 10 people in one room, I mean, inside the homes. That’s what they’re telling me. That’s what they’re telling me. They’re telling me, they’re making sure that that’s the case. And I have the more potent mask behind this one, I took it off when I came out here, I wear it inside this, that to be masked saves lives. And so, look, I just want to make sure that we’re able to be together next Thanksgiving, next Christmas. It is an international crisis. It’s an international health crisis. And the idea, we’re at war with a virus. And it is, we’re at war, for real. And all kidding aside, I hope all of you, I’ve watched you all. You all seem to wear masks all the time when you’re… And the group that follows me, that is here… Follows me, that is assigned to Delaware with me, seem to do that. I strongly urge you to do it. There’s nothing much about not wearing a mask. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President-Elect, Madam Vice President-Elect. Your plan… My mask is stuck in my earring. Classy. Hold on a second. Demonstrating for America. I’ve watched Jill try to take it off. It’s hard. Thank God I don’t have an earring. Your plan that you’ve outlined just now about a million union jobs, clean energy jobs, investments in HBCUs, those are things that take time. We have a problem with long-term unemployment that’s growing fast right now. What I would do, I would pass the Heroes Act. It has all the money and capacity to take care of each of those things, now. Now, not tomorrow. Now. And the idea the President is still playing golf and not doing anything about it, is beyond my comprehension. You’d at least think he’d want to go off on a positive note, but what is he doing? And there’s virtually no discussion. And the Republican were told, I don’t know that it’s true, you may know Senator, but there’s 22 Republicans say they won’t vote for anything. Well, there ought to be at least a dozen of them have the courage to stand up and save lives and jobs now. We should be doing it now. Keeping those businesses open, providing the PPE, the protective equipment, as well as the PPP, the money that we allow people to get funding to keep their businesses open, everything from separation, to testing, to a whole range of things that allow businesses to open and stay open. That’s what the plan was at the beginning. And by the way, if you notice in the very beginning, when they passed the stimulus program, the first two pieces, what happened? Businesses were staying open. And then when they weren’t open, they were still able to make people able to get paid. But look where they are now. People are running out of unemployment insurance. What are they going to do? 20 million people are on the verge of losing their home because they can’t make a mortgage payment. You have a larger number being kicked out, and will be kicked out, on the street because they can’t pay their rent. And by the way, it’s not just the renter, it’s the outfit that owns the building. A lot of them aren’t multimillionaires, they’re running small operations. How can they do it? This is about keeping Americans afloat. Get them through this pandemic, get them through where their business are able to come back. The money’s there. The money is there. And also on the economic front, as we fight the pandemic, world trade continues. And there is great debate over world trade agreements, international trade agreements. It seems that, in the last couple of days, 15 countries, Asian Pacific countries, have signed onto a new trade deal, the RCEP. I’ve talked with a number of these world leaders. And I told them under the law, I’m not able to begin to discuss with them. There’s only one President at a time, as to who can say what our policy will be. So I’m reluctant to answer that question now, but here’s what I can say, we make up 25% of the world’s trading capacity, of the economy of the world. We need to be aligned with the other democracies, another 25% or more, so that we can set the rules of the road, instead of having China and others dictate outcomes because they are the only game in town. But what I’m insisting on, and what I’ve been asked by world leaders, as to what I would do, without getting into detail, I’ve said, “But I want you to know that there are three things are going to happen if I’m elected. One, we’re going to invest in American workers and make them more competitive. Number two, we’re going to make sure that labor is at the table and environmentalists are at the table in any trade deals we make.” And I’m not looking for punitive trade. The idea that we are poking our finger in the eyes of our friends and embracing autocrats makes no sense to me. But I’m reluctant to get in more detail at this moment. I promise you I have a pretty thorough plan, and I hope you’re prepared to announce that to you on January 21st. You have indicated changes you want to make in US International Policy on other fronts, like the Paris Climate deal. Yes, that’s a generic notion of rejoining, but I didn’t get into the detail of what we will do in that agreement. The same thing with rejoining the World Health Organization. Because you’re asking me about whether I’d join a specific proposal, the details of which are now only being negotiated among those nations. In requiring negotiation. Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you all so much. Mr. Thank you so much. Thank you guys."
"148","11-18-20"," … my fire department got me down. My fire department got me down. So I couldn’t be talking to a group of people I have more admiration for. Look, thanks for doing this and for being willing to share what you’re going through. Because I want to know firsthand. I don’t want to know from reading about it in the press. This crisis has showed the nation we literally couldn’t survive without you all. And I mean that sincerely. You’ve always been essential, even if most of America hasn’t learned that term until recently. You’ve been protecting our communities from months. You’re being called on once again, as a virus surgeons across the nation. And I think in each year areas, it’s basically double in the near term. It’s not enough to praise you. We have to protect you. We have to pay you. And you deserve leadership that listens to you, and that works as hard for you as you do for the families and your communities. Because you are in your own communities. You know, the people you’re caring for. So I want to hear from you what’s on your mind, what you think is needed most, what I can do as your president to help you and your colleagues and the challenges you have. I’m not going to talk much more, but I’d like to hear from each of you. And then what I like to do is maybe ask you some questions and get a little more detail if that’s possible. Is that okay? Doc, how are we doing this? Dr. You’re doing perfect. Thank you so much, President-Elect Biden. Agree, it’s time to hear from our guests. So I’ll turn it over to Mr. Tony Murray. Please, Tony, introduce yourself and share with us your experience. Hello, first of all, thank you, President-Elect Biden for the opportunity and Dr. Nunez Smith and this great panel of people. It’s such an opportunity to talk about our perspective of things, so thank you. So I’m a firefighter paramedic. I’ve been in public safety for 26 years. Today, I’m speaking to you as the IFF local president for Hamilton County, Indiana, just North of Indianapolis. And I’m happy to provide a perspective here. I’m actually quarantining myself because of potential close contact exposure. So, living this just like so many other people are. As firefighters and EMT and paramedics, we see America at 2:00 AM. We recognize and see that people are struggling. We’ve seen this firsthand during this pandemic. We see what people are going through. In 26 years, I have not had the experience that I’ve experienced through this pandemic in terms of how our response has changed in such a prolonged period of time. Talk about just a concern, a couple of things. One is personal protective equipment. This is a concern for the following reasons. One, availability and access from our perspective. Firefighters, EMTs, paramedics, we are most folks first access to the public healthcare system. We’re treating wherever a person is, whatever they need and not just because they’re sick or with the virus or have symptoms, but whatever the emergency is. We’re the first access. We take people in our ambulances and treat them and get them to the hospital system. PPE is so important for our patients. To protect our patients, first and foremost. If we’re able to protect their patients, we need to then be able to protect ourselves by having access to this equipment. It’s so important. It’s vital. This stuff is intended for a single use, it’s disposable in essence. And we are wearing personal protective equipment, sometimes over and over again, because we don’t have quite the access that we need. It’s not intended for reuse. That puts people at risk. That puts our patients at risk in the community at risk. When it comes to PPE stockpiles, those really have been in this pandemic issued to hospitals and care facilities first, which leaves fire departments and EMS agencies left to the open market to go seek out and find what PPE is available. Obviously there’s a cost to that as well. And we’re sort of at a disadvantage from fire departments perspective when we operate in this way, going out into the market. Healthcare systems, they get their PPE by the semi-load. Fire departments are getting PPE what we can get through cases or maybe a skid or something. So PPE is, first and foremost, a concern. And as we progress through this pandemic, and we’re seeing numbers surge, we’re going through more and more PPE. Part of the issue here too, is that our workspace, wherever we work is really defined by the emergency. We work in uncontrolled environments. We can’t predict where we’re going to be working. This virus, respiratory virus is invisible. Oftentimes we don’t know who is positive and who is not. So we treat every call really by protecting ourselves and protecting our patients. Whether that’s Mrs. Smith who fell down. Is not injured, but, but she can’t get family access or has no other nobody else to call at the middle of the night. She calls the fire department, we show up and put Mrs. Smith back in bed and see what she needs. But we have to wear that personal protective equipment, both for Mrs. Smith and for our members. And when you talk about places that we work, it’s crawling into the inside of a car that’s flipped over on the side of a highway to take care of a mother and her child. That is close contact. You can’t get any more close contact than that. Those are the environments that we’re working in, which require us to be prepared and have access. Frontline healthcare workers, including firefighters, EMTs, paramedics, we’re seeing and experiencing increased exposures, increased firefighters, EMS workers who are having to go through quarantine. We’re seeing infection rates of our responders increase. This is becoming taxing, we know that. We know that there is a hopeful vaccine opportunities. And because of this, we live, as you know, Mr. President-Elect, we live communally in the firehouse. We’re doing what we can to space and to separate and to alter our meal eating schedules. But every time we get in those rigs to go answer the bell, we’re less than six feet away from each other. The other concern I would say is that as we go into vaccination, that our workers, our frontline healthcare workers and fire EMS have priority access to a vaccine. I think that that’s really important. And it has to be identified as a resource for us so we can continue to deliver these vital services when people need us the most. Well, thank you, Tom. Appreciate it, Mr. President. By the way, thanks for describing the first one in for me. Seriously, fire firefighters are incredible. All right. I’ll ask questions after everybody speaks. And by the way, if you see me in your camera looking up is because you’re on a big screen with me and they keep telling me to look in the camera. When I’m looking at the camera, I can’t see you when you’re talking. So I’m not, not paying attention. There’s a great big board in front of me and Tony’s to my left and Mary you’re my bottom left and so on. So anyway, I just want you to know that I’m not, not paying attention. Dr. Thank you for that. So thank you so much, Tony. So now I’ll turn it over to Brittany Williams. Please introduce yourself, Brittany and share your insights. My name is Brittany Williams and I am a third generation home care worker. And I’m a proud member of SEIU Service [inaudible 00:13:38] out of Seattle, Washington. [inaudible 00:13:41] before I understand more than ever the importance of the work that caregivers like myself do. It’s one of the fields that was literally birthed out of slavery and bondage. [inaudible 00:13:57] and seeing you, President-Elect Biden and Vice-President-Elect Harris put health care workers as one of your top priorities. It’s literally life changing for home care workers. Thank you. Caregivers, we’re the maintainers of life. You have first responders that’s on the screen with me. But once they take care of those people, it is us, the home care workers that maintain that care. We have to go in and out, into the elements, going to the pharmacies, going to the grocery stores to make sure that those people that we care for, because they’re more than clients, they become family. Make sure that they continue to [inaudible 00:14:53]. Even before COVID, even before we fought and won PPE in Washington State, caregivers were out there doing what had to be done, and we still are. We have to live with the ideal in the back of our head. That because of the job that we do going in and out of our homes and in and out of our client’s homes, taking them to their appointments, pharmacy as I said earlier, we could become guilty of passing COVID unknowingly. Like I said, we continue to do our job because it means so much to us. And as a third generation, it’s in my blood. This win is a lot more than just from the face of a caregiver, but I’m a woman of color and a mother of two beautiful black children. For them to see someone in office who has a heart for them, and truly understands the importance of rebuilding and bringing back this nation’s grandure, while we deal with a new situation of Trump influenced regime in Congress. And I understand that you have to bring balance with that. My [inaudible 00:16:21] is in the midst of working with that, in the midst of rebuilding this economy, please remember to push for it with the plan that you have [inaudible 00:16:33] put together, making sure that caregiver’s workforce is center, when it comes to rebuilding this nation. Most importantly, making sure that everyone that’s in home care and all workers are able to have good, strong unions. Thank you, Brittany. And I promise you, you have my word, I will do that. I’ve already begun to contact people about how we could put something like that together. My plan, which you know well, yes, ESIU has been strong on your behalf and behalf of all healthcare workers, and there’s a lot more we have to do, but thank you. And I have a couple of questions when we get finished. Thank you. Dr. Thank you, Brittany. So I’ll turn it over now to you, to Mary Turner, to introduce yourself and share with us what you’re seeing in the ICU. Okay. Good afternoon. My name is Mary Turner and I’m the president of Minnesota Nurses Association, which is an affiliate of the National Nurses United. That’s the largest union and professional association of registered nurses in the country. I proudly work as an ICU nurse on the night shift in a COVID unit at North Memorial in Robbinsdale, Minnesota, and I have been since the end of February. Thank you, Mr. President Elect, for inviting us to take part in this round table. National Nurses United has been proud to work closely with you, and we so deeply appreciate your commitment to addressing this pandemic and fighting to protect nurses and other frontline workers. Right now, COVID-19 infections are surging across Minnesota and the country. Our hospitals, I tell you, are overflowing with COVID patients and we aren’t prepared. We don’t have the necessary resources to keep patients and our workers safe. Nurses, I’m telling, you are feeling extremely anxious right now. We know the right way to battle this virus, but our employers and our government are not supporting us. We’re trying to care for patients, despite limited supplies, limited staff, and a rapid decline in the hospital beds. And all the while, we know that we could become infected and our families could be infected at any time. The physical impacts of this virus have been devastating. I myself have held the hand of dying patients who are crying out for their family that they can’t see. I’ve taken care of coworkers as they fight for their lives on a ventilator, and knowing that they got sick because of the hospital or their government hasn’t protected them. Throughout this pandemic, we’ve had to reuse N95s so many times. Sometimes the masks literally fall off our faces. In my hospital, we’re still reusing N95s two times, but I know hospitals that they’re still using eight to 10 shifts. We can’t stay safe when we are using these kind of standards. As a result, nurses are getting sick. A month ago in my hospital, nine ICU nurses were out with COVID. Just recently, we had 12 emergency room nurses out with COVID. We need to protect their frontline workers so that we can take care of you. Remember, there is no second line of defense. It’s us. As president of the Minnesota Nurses Association, I have been on multiple picket lines with frontline healthcare workers who are protesting to get the PPE that they need and other protections. President Elected Biden, there is something seriously wrong when nurses have to take to the streets to beg for protection in the middle of a pandemic. What we’re experiencing in Minnesota is what nurses are experiencing all over the country. We’re not being given the protection that we need. We need to have optimal PPE for all staff to prevent airborne and droplet transmissions. We need testing of our workers and patients and contact tracing, and notification of exposure for healthcare workers. Do you know that I have not been tested yet? And I have been on the front lines in the ICU since February. You’re kidding me. No. We also need safe staffing of nurses in the hospital units and patients who are, or may be, COVID positive patients must be isolated from the general patient population. Workers who have been exposed or who are sick need to be allowed to quarantine at home without fear of losing income in their jobs. This is a novel virus, but the principles of infection control are not. Our hospitals have not been providing these basic protections. This is why it is so critical for the federal, state, and local governments to step in to ensure that nurses are protected. Unfortunately, the federal government has not been there. As a result, the pandemic is surging and frontline workers are getting sick and dying. Nurses across the country were so relieved and grateful, Mr. President Elect, when you committed to taking action that we need to have to get this pandemic under control. Thank you for committing to invoke the Defense Production Act, to increase manufacturing and distribution of PPE, which we need to establish, and also for establishing an OSHA emergency temporary standard on infectious diseases, which could enforce protections we need from our employers. Thank you for that. We are also grateful that you have committed to a robust and comprehensive pandemic stimulus plan to make sure that our patients have the economic support they need. We nurses, we know that we are facing immense death and suffering in the coming weeks and we will be there, but we need to act now. We need to act quickly to protect our healthcare workers so that we can save as many lives as possible. Thank you. I’m sorry I’m so emotional. You got me emotional. Look, anyone who’s spent significant time in ICU like I did for months … You know what I used to do? After I got out, I observed, this is not COVID, but I observed the incredible mental strain on nurses and ICU units. And you know what I did for a long time after I got out? I used to drive back and forth to Wilmington, Delaware. I commuted every day. The night shift? Cool. That’s cool. And well, one of the things that one of my neurosurgeons said to me was you only see people walk out of the ICU. Either they’re walking out and they don’t ever want to come back because they don’t want the memory or they’re carried out and they can’t come back. And the [inaudible 00:25:23] for you guys is missing. You don’t see the people you save come back. And so I’m sorry for me to get personal about it, but there’s a lot that I want to talk with you about, but … We used to say in the Senate, excuse the point of personal privilege here. But thank you, thank you, thank you for what you do and all your colleagues, male and female, who are manning those [inaudible 00:25:53]. And now I know we got Patricia’s next and she’s a nurse with students. So I’m anxious to hear you, hear what you have to say, Patricia. Well, thank you. Pat is great. Pat. Is that okay, Pat? You can call me Joe. That’s absolutely fine. Yes. Okay. Well, first of all, thank you for having me. And also thank you to my colleagues here on this call for sharing and just know that we’re all with you and our thoughts are with you. We’re all in this together. And on a positive note, we now have good leadership and that’s going to change things around. That is going to make the difference. I’ve been a school nurse for my whole life, 38 years. I work in the inner city Cleveland schools where there’s 100% poverty and 85% of the children are minority. And I’m also a proud union member of the American Federation of teachers, where I sit on the executive board as the only nurse. And I like to be at the table as a union member, because I like to have a voice. I think we do the work and we should be able to share our voice at the table and I’m so appreciative of that. I think so much of the problem is that there’s been no federal plan, no leadership. And it’s really hurt us. Our health department here in Cleveland really is bare bones. It’s still bare bones. Our contact tracers are working 24/7, but they’re about four days out. They’re about four days from contacting a positive case. So in those four days, that positive COVID person has been in the community, maybe with other family members. And I think that has really contributed to the increasing in cases. Also, when this first happened, the school nurses got together and our schools closed on March 20th. And we all got together and we got all of our PPE out of schools and we drove it to the hospitals because they needed it. It was the right thing to do. So now, as we talk about reopening and going back, we don’t have any PPE. Our school buildings, our infrastructure will be in bad shape. We have no ventilation in some of those schools. And you have to remember, whatever is going on in the community is going to be going on in the schools. So as long as the numbers are accelerated in the community, we, we just can’t reopen. And we want to reopen. We are remote. The school nurses have set up virtual clinics for all our kids in all our schools. They have our number. They can go on and talk to us virtually anytime. And the one thing that concerns me in talking to all these children is their mental health condition. Absolutely. They are really in bad shape. They are traumatized and I fear for them now. And I fear that when we go back, we won’t have the boots on the ground to give them the support. If I could do anything, I would mandate a school nurse in every school every day. And I’m sure Dr. Biden would support me on this as well. She does. Teachers need support. A teacher can’t be a psychologist, a counselor, Johnny has a nosebleed and a meltdown, and they are trying to teach. They love to teach. It’s what they do. But they can’t do it all. And so many times in the past, they’ve been demonized and their evaluations have been based on how students are doing. And it’s not fair. They’ve had value added put into their evaluations many times, and it’s just not been fair to them. They do want to teach. They do. They are good at what they do. I think the science has not carried the conversation. When we talk about people wearing masks in public, I really feel like we need to get the science out there more. If we get the science out there, I think the patterns will follow. I think people will be more willing to wear a mask and follow through. But I think the science has been ignored and I think that’s what has caused all the disruption. Oh, let’s see. I was fortunate enough to be a part of the Clinton Global Initiative. We went and took care of children in the last hurricane. And I just wanted to say thank you for that as well, because we’re about taking care of children everywhere. I’m also worried about the children at the borders right now. AFT went there. We tried to get in. We tried to see some children and they threw us out. I thought we were going to get arrested, and we never did really get to see how the children were doing. But listen, those are going to be our children. They’re going to come into our country. We need to make sure they’re healthy, make sure they’re immunized. And I would like the opportunity to, as a school nurse, to be able to somehow be a part of that. I think that’s about all I had on my list. I hope school nurses are going to stand ready to help with this vaccine distribution. School nursing has a public health foundation. We’ve been through smallpox and polio and measles. And actually it was a school nurse that discovered H1N1 in the schools. So we’re ready to help. If we could just have some more boots on the ground, we’ll do whatever we can do to help you. Well, thank you all. Let me say a few things and I want to ask you each specific questions if I may. Dr. Nunez Smith up at Yale knows a great deal about the science and I could see the look on her face as each of you were talking, it struck her as well. Look, number one, I am optimistic, but we should be further along. One of the problems that we’re having now is the failure of the administration to recognize. The law says that the General Services Administration has a person who recognizes who the winner is. And then they have to have access to all the data and information that the government possesses to be prepared. And it doesn’t require there to be an absolute winner. It says the apparent winner. The apparent winner. Yes to the kinds of things we need to know about the depth of the stockpiles. We know there’s not much at all. We get to the point where we have a sense of when these vaccines comes out, how they’ll be distributed, who will be first in line, what the plan is. There are over 300 million Americans and beyond our border that they’re going to have to be taken care of. And there’s a whole lot of things that we just don’t have available to us. Unless it’s made available soon, we’re going to be behind by weeks or months being able to put together the whole initiative relating to the biggest promise we have with two drug companies coming along and finding 95% effectiveness efficiency in the vaccines, which is an enormous promise. So, I just want to tell you that that’s the only slow down right now that we have. We put together I think a first rate team that you would all be proud of. And we’re all ready to go and doing an awful lot of work right now. But here’s the thing that I want to mention. There’s already a circumstance where nationwide, because of the requirement of school districts, county offices, mayors, governors having to balance their budgets, they’ve already had to lay off 666,000 teachers. 666,000 teachers have been laid off already since March. And I’m worried that, Tony, that I know in Noblesville, you have a force about 135 firefighters. Correct. And the question’s going to be: When do we have to start laying off, because the counties and the cities don’t have the money? They can’t deficit spend, they have to spend based on balancing their budget when the first responders and fire service will be laid off, including all those folks like you who run those emergency ambulances and get people to where they have to get quickly. And so the point I want to make to you is that I was the guy who ran the Recovery Act when we inherited the Great Recession when we got elected back in 2009. And I was asked to figure out how to do distribute, to keep us from going into a depression, $800 billion in 18 months. And I was in constant contact with all the local officials, governors, city, county, all folks, including the various unions you all belong to and the skills that you all possess. And we were able to put, I was authorized, I was able to spend $140 billion on state and local governments to keep you all employed. They didn’t get fired to make sure that the fire service maintained its same strength, because the community badly needs to make sure that the nurses, doctors, et cetera, mental health clinics all were able to stay open. That law enforcement was able to still function, et cetera. And Congress has already passed that money, it’s sitting there. It’s available right now. But we’re unwilling, some of our friends on the Senate side are unwilling to spend the money. When we talk about states going bankrupt and having to lay off thousands upon thousands of people, one of the leaders on the other side said, “Well, let the states go bankrupt. Just let them go bankrupt.” It’s not a responsible position. And I’m hoping that the reason why my friends on the other side have not stepped up to do something is because of their fear of retribution from the President. And hopefully when he’s gone, they’ll be more willing to do what they know should be done, has to be done in order to save the communities they live in. And so, let me begin by asking you all, and I’d like each of you to give me a brief answer. Tony, how much do you worry about, as a president of the firefighters, do you worry about the mental health, the need for your employee, your firefighters? And I know it’s not something people are comfortable talking about, but mental health is the same as physical health. There should be no distinction whatsoever, none whatsoever. And just like an awful lot of my son’s compatriots who fought with him in Iraq for a year, coming home with PTSD and needing help. But they’re trained not to ask for anything, we’ve got to get by this. (silence). 107 students. It just can’t go on like this. And think of all those families you serve, Pat, that in fact don’t have enough food to eat and are worried whether or not the cafeteria will stay open to be able to get food to their homes. You see the lines. You see the lines for miles and miles and miles on television. People in their cars, because of the enormous food shortages people have right now. And, Brittany, when I look at what you guys are doing is enormous. Think of all the people on the screen who in fact have children or have an elderly parent who’s really sick and in trouble, and they have to make a choice between do they give up their job and stay home to take care of the child who’s home, who’s young, and/or make sure that they take care of that elderly parent who is sick and needs help. And you’re there. You’re there. No, I really mean it. I’m not being solicitous. My dad was in hospice at my home and my mother as well later. I watch it. I have great family and I had an income as a US senator, but I thought of all those people that I know who had to make a choice, do they eat or take care of their by keeping their job, or do they take care of their child, or take care of their elderly parent? And so, there’s a lot of things we can do and we can easily afford to do as a nation. But let me ask a couple of specific questions. What is your sense, Pat, and tell me about your, what you call your Corona Crew. What’s your Corona Crew is? Because I read the background on is. Talk with me about it for a minute. So, the Corona Crew is made up of four school nurses that just got on a Zoom call, like we are and said, “Okay, what are we going to do? What are we going to do? Our children are suffering, our parents are suffering, our teachers are suffering. What are we going to?” So, we created a hotline it’s 838-WELL. And anyone in the community can call and talk to us. And we direct them, if they’re sick or sometimes they just want empathy. They just want someone to listen to what they’re going through. And we’re, of course now with the increase in the virus, we need to put more nurses on it. And we are, but from that, we’ve been able to collect data and we share it with the health department and we have a plan to figure out what direction we have to go with this virus. We are taking a lot of calls from children. I had a call the other day, the child said, “I have a fever. My mother said, ‘Take some Tylenol, I have to go to work.'” Most of our parents, I would say all of our parents are essential workers. So, the children are home and they’re trying to do remote learning. And some of them are sick. And so, we called this child’s mother and we were able to get her tested and she was positive. And that’s how we’re trying to help the people in our community. Mary, let me ask you a question, Mary, you talked about the hospital’s administrators not stepping up. First, I will say at our hospital that we’re down to the two shifts that we wear N95. And we’re a level one trauma, and they have tried to bring down the numbers, ’cause we started off back in February wearing our N95s 10 times, 10 shifts. So, they have tried, but this is where the lack of a federal plan has really hurt the states. I mean, I’m on the governor’s task force in Minnesota. And so, I know all about when we had shipments of a million N95s coming our way and all of a sudden they were sidetracked and they didn’t come. And so, I have to place the blame on the lack of our hospitals being able to get secure supply lines. Okay. What our problem is now is that we need to be… My hospital’s going down in their use, but I have other hospital systems all across M&A and we span four different that are not doing that. Nurses that are still wearing at 10 times a piece, hospitals that aren’t doing universal masking. Every person in a hospital should be wearing some kind of personal protective equipment. I mean, everybody. The housekeepers, the food service, everybody. From the moment you get out of your car, you should be wearing personal protective equipment. That’s not happening. Well, that’s the thing is that we have yet to hear how much equipment that they actually have. And this is where it’s the go ask mom, go ask dad. You’ve got the state saying, “We’ve got the supplies, they just need to ask for it.” And also the transparency is what we need. We need the transparency as far as how you’re going to handle elective surgeries and all the COVID patients at the same time. We need transparency on how much staffing we have. What’s it going to look like? When are we going into a surge plan? A lot of our anxiety is the not knowing what the plan is. All right. I understand that. My son-in-law is a surgeon in Philadelphia at one of the major hospitals, and they’re going through a similar crisis, but it’s mainly because not being able to access PPE. And the idea that hospitals should have to compete with one another to get PPE is bizarre. That shouldn’t happen at all. Let me ask you another question, if I may. I mean, ’cause I’ve observed but I’ve never seen a firefighter decide whether it’s going to crawl under that car that is upside down, the roof crushed and say, “By the way, are you black or white in there?” Or, “Do you have COVID or don’t you have COVID? Do you have a child or don’t you have a child?” You guys just go do it. And what is the major concern your women and men are talking about these days? About whether they’re going to be rescuing someone who has COVID and they’re going to get it or is it just the constant concern and frustration about constantly being called on in times when there’s no one else to call, call your fire department? No matter what it is. I mean, talk to me about… Look, I spent a lot of time in firehouses. Tell me what’s going on around that table, other than social distancing, in the firehouse when you’re having a meal. And thanks for bringing up the mental health piece, because that is in all of us. That transcends every worker. It’s the mental health piece. And so, thanks for bringing that up. And my union’s done a great job, even before the pandemic, of bringing this issue out of the shadows and to talk about this and to get the treatment that people need. So, we’ve been blessed to have a foundation and guidance to go to it. We’re a brother and sisterhood too, so oftentimes we’re checking in with one another. But to answer your question about the greatest concern of firefighters and paramedics, I really would answer it this way, that it’s not about doing the job, because every time the bell rings, our commitment and our pledge is to respond. You can count on us always. But I think always in the back of the mind is, “Okay, if I contract this disease, I don’t want to bring it home to my family. I don’t want to bring it home to my kids. I don’t want to bring it inside. So, I literally have people sleeping in their car for a certain amount of time outside of the home in the driveway, so they don’t take it into their family until they can get a test or get a results of the test. So, there’s many, many things happening. People sleeping in campers. That I think is the biggest the component here is to we have to do our job and we’ll always find a way to do our job. And we’ll never ask a question, we’ll just do it. That’s what we do. We go and answer the call and take care of the emergency, take care of the person. This is a humanitarian effort every day, 365, that’s the work that we do. But I think that those two things go hand in hand is that of fear of transmitting to family, but also having to just push all of these feelings down, because you got to get up and go the next day. You got to get up and do it again. Yeah. Mary, let me ask you. I’ve done a number of these kinds of calls over the last 10, 15 months. And what I’m finding, I spoke to. What I’m finding, I spoke to a registered nurse. She happened to be an ICU nurse. It was in Philadelphia. Actually, that’s not true. It was in Norristown, I think, but anyway, Pennsylvania. She talked about when she got home her husband would, as she pulled in the garage … Her husband would make sure she had a change of clothes in the garage. They installed a portable shower in the laundry room as you went in. She’d strip down completely, take a shower and cleanse, and put on a new set of clothes before she’d go in the house because she was scared to death that she would transmit it to her children. She happened to have young children, but it’s irrelevant whether young or old. Is that something your nurses talk about, or do they do …? Talk to me about when they leave a shift and they’re dealing with a COVID patient. That’s exactly what’s happening all across the nation. Nurses all across the nation are doing that to protect their households. I’ve heard it. I work with a lot of young nurses with young children, and they describe that very thing. I feel for them when it gets to be 30 below here in Minnesota, changing in the garage. Well, this woman had the garage and she was able to go in the laundry room. It’s right off the garage. Yeah. I’m just trying to lighten the mood a little bit here, but you bring a very good point. When we’re at work and just like with the firefighters, we do not have the luxury. We do not have the luxury of stopping and thinking about our emotions. I think sometimes my release is when I do some kind of a media thing because it all comes crashing around me. I listen to nurses all over my organization, text me, call me, Facebook me their concerns. Like you said, you’re on 24/7, 365 days a year, and you don’t get the luxury to stop and think about your emotions at all. Well, one of the things, I think is … I’m sorry, go ahead, Pat. I wanted to chime in on what Mary was saying. We had a little bit of a conversation before you came on. She shared with me, and I heard this on my AFT call this past week, that nurses are having a positive COVID test, and they are being made to come to work, positive COVID. They can’t take off because they won’t be paid. Even some with symptoms are being told they must show up on the job and that is just very troubling to me. It is very troubling and should have been anticipated because we’re in a situation where we lost a hundred and how many died last week? We’re up to a quarter million dead. We have hundreds of thousands of people on a weekly basis now, 1,000 people a day dying, and now it’s up beyond that. There’s just such an overwhelming shortage. I’m keeping you all awfully long here, and I’m going to end this, but look. One of the things that I have concluded, and the team that we put together, I’ve been for the last seven months three times a week getting an hour and a half brief from some of the leading docs in the country on a regular basis about the state of play that day, that week, exactly who’s sick where, how, why, et cetera. One of the things that we should be investing our money is finding out how to get and quick turnaround testing available. Yes. You notice that that is running short. The idea, you can get a test and find out in four days doesn’t help you a whole hell of a lot. No. In terms of being able to do much of anything. That’s one of the things that we’re going to be working on as well, but look. What I’d like to do is I’d like to make sure that we can figure out how to stay in contact with you all. There’s a group of all the folks I’ve spoken to we do that with, and to let you know what we’re doing, what we plan on doing. Now I have no budget. I can’t do any of this until I’m sworn in or I can convince the President now to do things that should be being done already. There’s hardly been a meeting that’s taken place in the White House about any of this, but I’m convinced that we can get it done. The question is whether we wait till another … The estimates are, Dr. Nunez-Smith can tell you and the group we put together. The estimates are we’re going to have another, as many as another 200,000 dead, maybe exceed 400,000 people by the time we get sworn in. This is reached a proportion that is way, way, way, way out of whack. You look at those curves I look at every day in the brief I get. It is skyrocketing. It is skyrocketing with no real end in sight now in 44 states. One of the things that I’m going to be doing, matter of fact, I’m not even going to wait till we’re sworn in. There’s enough Republican and Democratic governors who have now come around, the Democratic governors, and I’m not being partisan with the exception of a few Republicans like the Governor of Ohio who’s been straightforward about wearing masks and the like. Now you have the Governor of North Dakota, you have others figuring out that this is real, we’ve got to do something. It’s not a political statement. It’s not about whether you’re a tough guy or not a tough guy, whether you’re … It’s about patriotism. If you really care about your country, what you want to do is keep your neighbors and your family safe. That’s what you do, and you wear a mask, and you socially distance. You wash your hands regularly, and you access, when available, the ability to get testing. I don’t mean to in any way suggest there’s not a lot more we could talk about, but I want to thank you for sharing your stories with me and everything you’re doing to keep your community safe. You really are, it’s not hyperbole, you’re heroes. You’re struggling to get your personal protective equipment you need to do your job, protect yourself, protect your families. You’re focused on your students, your patients while your own kids are struggling with remote learning, by the way. If we don’t figure out how to get these kids back to school, we’re going to find that an entire generation is going to lose a year, a year and a half in terms of their learning ability. They’re going to be behind the curve. This is a building block problem here. We’re worried about your parents and your students, as I said, the mental health in addition to the burdens that you and your families are taking on. All those folks, by the way, are being quarantined at home. There’s a significant rise in spousal abuse. There’s a significant rise in suicides. It’s all real. What I’m hoping is we don’t have to have anymore suffering to convince the public at large that this requires some very significant action. One of the things I’m going to be doing is thanking the governors that have already moved, but calling on all the leaders in the states to have mandatory masking, testing, tracing, social distancing. For example, the docs that have been advising me all along are telling me, and it’s going to cause problems in my family. Thanksgiving is coming up. Well, they said, “Joe, maximum 10 people in your home, maximum, Joe.” I got a big family you probably heard a lot about. We do everything together. There are going to be three of us because you can’t mix the families that have been away, that haven’t been quarantined, not away, in other words, live a different place. All of these difficult decisions, people are going to be making. We got to give them hope. We got to give them hope, and I believe there is reason for optimism. Granted, it could come quicker if we move quicker, but there is hope on the way, not because of me. I’m not like, hope is on the way, but there’s a realization that’s coming upon everyone, and I promise you I will be using the Defense Authorization Act. I will be using the Bully Pulpit. The words of a president matter, whether they’re good, smart, bad or good. A president can make a market climb or cause it to fall, can send people to war, can bring peace. The words of a president matter. I promise you, I’m going to be echoing to the public as President of the United States and as [inaudible 01:01:13] President of the United States, all that you’ve been talking to me about, all that you’ve been talking to me about. It does matter. It does matter, if in fact, you and the organizations you belong to let your local officials know. Contact them, write them. Let them know, Republicans and Democrats, what you want to see done. It will, I believe, change. You’re all making extraordinary sacrifices, and you’re bearing a significant amount of the stress, and that is worsened by, I think, the mismanagement of this virus thus far. I want you to know first and foremost how grateful, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart, how grateful I personally am, and my family is to all of you, all of you. You’ve done so damn much, and I want to thank you. As President, I’m going to fight as hard as I can, as hard as you’re fighting for your communities. We’re going to make sure that you get the personal protective equipment you need. We’re going to make sure you have paid sick leave. We’re going to make sure that you can care for your families. I mean it sincerely. We’re going to make sure we don’t just praise you, but we actually praise you. We’re going to protect your right to collective bargaining, and form a union, and we’re going to lead a robust and aggressive effort to control the virus. We’re going to provide cities, states, schools, businesses with federal guidance on operating. There is no one single place anybody can go to get the kind of guidance they need whether it’s opening a school or maintaining access to healthcare. We’re going to work like the devil with state and local leaders on mask mandates, as I said, Democrat, Republican. Together, we’re going to honor the work you’re doing and aggressively control this crisis. I promise you, that’s what I’m going to attempt to do. When I make a mistake, I’ll acknowledge it. I’ll take responsibility because it is, this is like going to war. This is like going to war. You need a commander-in-chief. I’ve watched a lot of presidents in my career. I’ll make mistakes, but I promise you I’ll acknowledge them when I make them as well as I’ll take responsibility. Thank you, and as my mother would say, hope you keep me in your prayers too that I get it right. Thank you, President. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much."
"149","11-19-20"," Good afternoon. President Elect Biden and I just met with a bipartisan group of Democratic and Republican governors. We talked about what we need to do to make free testing available for everyone, to make a free vaccine available for everyone, and to get this pandemic under control. Governors are elected by their States to take action in moments of crisis. They’re the ones who go to the places and talk to the people who are hardest hit. And during this pandemic, they have been called on to make very difficult decisions about the health and safety of the people they represent, about opening schools and about opening our economy responsibly. I have served in both state and local government, so I understand the critical role our governors play, and they will have partners in the White House starting on January 20th. Because as Governor Herbert said in our meeting, when the states are successful, the country is successful. So our message to our governors and to all of our nation’s state and local leaders is simple. President Elect Biden and I will make sure you have the resources and support you need to save lives and help get our economy back on track. And we will also make sure that our federal state local and tribal authorities are working closely together so we can tackle these challenges as effectively as possible. Because when it comes to this pandemic and the economic recovery, we are not Democrats or Republicans. We are Americans. And we will be there for one another. That’s the kind of leadership the American people need and deserve. And it’s the kind of leadership President Elect Biden and I will provide. And it is now my great honor to introduce President Elect Joe Biden. Hello folks. Good afternoon. Thanks for your patience. The Vice President Elect and I, as just was pointed out, have just concluded a video conference with the executive leadership of the National Governors Conference. That included Governor Cuomo, New York, Governor Hutchinson, Governor Hogan, Governor Whitmer, Governor Ivey, Governor Polis, Governor Baker, Governor Lujan Grisham, Governor Herbert, and Governor Carney. And it was really a worthwhile undertaking. They’ve had to make some really tough calls through this unprecedented crisis, and we’re incredibly for everything they’ve done and keep doing to try to keep their communities safe. Unfortunately, because of the lack of a sermon, as they say, which that’s a fancy word these days, but until the head of the GSA says that we, in fact, our team, this transition team, our team, the Senator and I in fact are the likely winners, until she does that, we don’t have access to all the information that we need to get from all the various agencies. We’re not able to deal with everything from testing to guidance, to the all important issue of vaccine distribution, and even more importantly, vaccination plan to actually get vaccinations. We haven’t been able to get into Operation Warp Speed, but we will take what we’ve learned today and build it into our planning. The country is still in a crisis and there’s a dark winter still ahead. Yesterday, America reached another tragic milestone, 250,000 deaths. A quarter of a million people died due to COVID-19 and there are empty chairs and dining room tables just were filled just days and weeks ago with loved ones, family and friends who laughed and talked together. To those families and friends that are left behind, Jill and I send our love and our prayers. We know like many of you do how tough it is to find purpose in the memory of a loved one you’ve just lost. It will take time, but you’ll find it. You’ll find it. And you’ll find your purpose as we are going to find our purpose for our nation as a nation now. I promise you that. And I promise you that we’ll work together. There’s a great meeting we had today. All the governors, no matter their political party, whether they’re from wherever part of the country they represented, no matter what their political philosophy, shared a strong and abiding sense of a common purpose. There was a real desire for a real partnership between the states and the federal government. Each of the governors emphasized that we might be Democrats or Republicans, but we’re all Americans first. They congratulated us heartedly for our win. What really pleased me was most was the governors made clear that beating COVID-19 is going to require all of us working together as one country. Kamala and I agree. We were deeply impressed with how much consensus there was how to move forward among the governors. What we need to do now is how we need to do it. We discussed a number of critical ways we can work together and unify around a national approach to controlling COVID-19. First, delivering economic relief to the city, states, and tribal communities. The lost revenue from COVID and the cost of COVID recovery is devastating to state and local budgets. As governors, as all of them indicated, we’ve got to come together. The federal government has to deliver this release sooner rather than later, and with flexibility for the states to meet their needs. This includes helping businesses, schools, working families, from unemployment benefits to early education, continued access to affordable health care, all of that’s needed during this pandemic. States and communities shouldn’t have to lay off teachers, cops, firefighters, cut vital services for families and businesses. The second thing there was uniform agreement on, delivering a safe and equitable and free vaccine. The governors all acknowledged that this be a massive undertaking, one of the greatest operational challenges we will have faced as a nation. One statistic that was raised by the governors, it took eight months to provide 100 million COVID tests. Eight months to provide COVID tests. Just imagine how much more difficult will be, they pointed out, if we don’t find a more efficient and effective way to provide 330 million vaccinations. Put it in perspective. They made the point we can’t wait. That’s what the governors are raising. In the meeting, we discussed the challenges that lie ahead in distributing and administering the vaccine. The governors talked about how getting doses of vaccine distributed is just one step. We have to actually get vaccinations into the arms of 330 million Americans. That takes enormous resources, people, product. We discussed the difficulty of that task. It’s going to take time. It’s going to take coordination. It’s going to take the federal government and state governments working hand in glove, working together. The governors all emphasized we need to be clear with the American people about what to expect. No false expectations. Let them know what we anticipate. They all acknowledged that this is going to take a massive public education campaign. And we also need to reach traditionally underserved communities that are being hardest hit by the pandemic. Black, brown, Latino, Latin American communities, native American communities, small towns, rural communes. They talked about that in some detail. Thirdly, we discussed the need to help states with Title 32 funding for the national guard. That’s a fancy way of saying governors need to be able to get funding when they need to bring their National Guard into play. And National Guards are going to have to play this. It costs a lot of money and governors need that paid for. Governor discussed the need for funding when waiving certain FEMA fees. The fact is that this is a national emergency. That’s what FEMA is supposed to deal with. Our view is that should be done. When it comes to deploying the National Guard or COVID or real relief, that should be paid for. That’s something Kamala and I will be very focused on. And fourthly, we discussed the implementation of a national mask mandate. 10 governors, Democrat and Republican, have imposed masking requirements and recognize the need for universal masking. North, South, East, and West. It’s not a political statement. It’s a patriotic duty. And fifth, we discussed making testing more available and accessible. Anyone who wants a test should be able to get one. Period. And finally, while we focused on the immediate needs to control the virus, the governors also raised and talked about how much we have to build back better, especially on infrastructure and education and so much more. This was not a one-off meeting. I committed, we committed. We agreed that we’ll continue to work and meet with the governors on a regular basis, continue to seek their input, and that our COVID teams will follow up and coordinate on the issues coming out of that call because some of them have very competent people on their COVID teams in their states. The bottom line, we can do this. There’s nothing beyond our capacity. But we have to come together as a country. What this meeting along with others we’ve had reinforces in my view is the unity the country is looking for. They’re looking for us to come together and deal with problems, most of which have no ideological basis for disagreement. That’s what we have to do. That’s what the governors talked about. It really was pleasing to hear them. I want to thank you all and may God bless you. And those who lost someone, you’re in our prayers. May God protect our troops. I’m happy to take a few questions. And my boss is going to tell me who that is. Thank you, Mr. President elect. I know you mentioned the economic impact and talked a bit about the relief package you wanted, but I was wondering if we could talk about things that you’ll be able to do just as president or what will sort of govern your decision in terms of the economy. Well, look, let me try to take them one at a time. You’ll soon hear my choice for treasury. I’ve made that decision. We’ve made that decision. And you’ll hear that either just before or just after Thanksgiving, number one. And you’ll find it as someone who I think will be accepted by all elements of the Democratic party, from the progressive to the moderate coalitions. Secondly, it’s not so much about punishing China. It’s about making sure China understands they got to play by the rules. It’s a simple proposition. And so that’s one of the reasons why we’re going to rejoin the World Health Organization. We’re going to rejoin on day one as well. And it needs reform, I acknowledge. And rejoin the Paris Climate Accord. And we have to make sure that the rest of the world and we get together and make sure there are certain bright lines the Chinese understand. We have to not only deal with this pandemic, we got to plan for the next one. The idea that viruses are going to go away is just not rational. We’re going to recalibrate and set up the institutional structures we had in our administration of Obama Biden and build on it. It was about the dollar, sir, whether you think a strong dollar will help or hurt with unemployment. Well, quite frankly, the way the Federal Reserve has been approaching dealing with the dollar I think has been in a positive direction. Our interest rates are as low as they have been in modern history. And I think that is a positive thing. It lends credence to the possibility of us being able to spend the money in deficit spend in order to be able to generate economic growth right off the bat. And so I think it’s been positive so far. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President Elect. You have said that if this transition doesn’t get going, especially coordination on vaccine distribution, that lives will be lost. Well, look, you’ve heard the projections. The projections are that if nothing fundamentally changes between now and beginning of February, we’re likely to lose up to total of 400,000 lives, another 150,000 lives. And so it’s real, whether it’s that, it gets to 360, whatever it is, it’s real. And there is no excuse not to share the data and let us begin to plan. Because on day one, it’s going to take us time. If we don’t have access to all this data, it’s going to put us behind the eight ball by a matter of a month or more. And that’s lives. How many would be lost as a consequence of that? I can’t tell you. We talked a lot about with the governor’s about what the immediate needs are. We’re going to employ the Defense Production Act to be able to go out there and dictate companies build and do following things. We need much more testing. We need much more masking. We need gloves. I asked the National Governors Association through the Governor Cuomo and the ones on the line to let us know what their shortages are, what they anticipate, because we’re going to move on day one. That should be moved on now. Now. But if it waits, it takes a long time to get this thing going. And when you take a step back and you look at the way the president is handling this, his refusal to concede, what do you think is really going on here? In your view, Mr. Let me choose my words here. I think they’re witnessing incredible irresponsibility, incredibly damaging messages being sent to the rest of the world about how democracy functions. And I think it is … Well, I don’t know his motive, but I just think it’s totally irresponsible. No, I’m not concerned the vast majority of the American people. All the polling data has indicated, although the Republicans who worry about it, it’s higher, but over 78% of the American people believe it’s without question, it’s legitimate. And I think most of the Republicans I’ve spoken to, including some of the governors, think this is debilitating. It sends a horrible message about who we are as a country. Thank you, Mr. President Elect. Thank you, Vice President Elect Harris. Appreciate it. Nice to see you in person, not on television. Nice to see you as well. Yes. Appreciate it. You have said that lives could be lost if you don’t start getting briefings from the Trump Administration. And now here we are more than 250,000 lives could be lost. It would take a lot of time. It would take time. It’s not going to speed it up considerably in my view. And in the meantime, I am hopeful that I’m going to be able to get cooperation from our Republican colleagues in the Senate and the House, as well as the governors to build a consensus as to how we proceed when we do. I’m making a judgment based on many years of experience in how to get things done with the opposition. My judgment is that we’ll get further along by actually working with our Republican colleagues now because the time in which we would win would not materially change necessarily. But it’s still an open question. It’s an open question. It could change. We haven’t ruled it out. Okay. And given the death toll now, more than 250,000 Americans who have now lost their lives, you have said that you would support a nationwide shutdown if scientists recommended it. No, no. Everybody asks that question every single time I stand here. It was a hypothetical question. The answer was I would follow the science. I am not going to shut down the economy, period. I’m going to shut down the virus. That’s what I’m going to shut down. I’ll say it again. No national shutdown. No national shutdown, because every region, every area, every community can be different. And so there’s no circumstance which I can see would require a total national shutdown. I think that would be counterproductive. But there are constraints in which the degree to which businesses can be open. For example, it’s one thing to say that you can have, in a state where their infection rate is not as high, you can have a gymnasium open. It’s another thing to say it can only be open four hours a day with X number of people. The church I go to, my Catholic church, they don’t allow more than 40% of the people to come into the church. Those are rational decisions. It’s not shutting down everything. It’s calibrating based on what the threat is. Thank you, Mr. President Elect. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President Elect and Vice President Elect Harris. A question for you first, which is what do you make of the fact that the president is having these calls with Michigan County officials amid his bid to overturn the election? He’s going to be having also Michigan Republican legislators at the White House tomorrow. Is anything that he’s doing making you rethink your strategy? I know you say that you don’t want to have legal action right now. Hang on. I’m on my way. That’s what I say to them. Not a joke. And what the president’s doing now is really, it’s going to be another incident where he will go down in history as being one of the most irresponsible presidents in American history. It’s just not even within the norm at all. There’s questions whether it’s even legal, but it’s going to be interesting who shows up in this call to meet with the leadership. We’ve won Michigan. It’s going to be certified. We’re going to end up making clear, they are, making it clear that we won. It’s hard to fathom how this man thinks. It’s hard to fathom. I’m confident he knows he hasn’t won and is not going to be able to win and we’re going to be sworn in on January 20th. But far for me to question his motive. It’s just outrageous what he’s doing. I’m not going to rule anything out or anything in. But at the moment, the strategy, it’s not changing. Sure. Vice President Elect Harris, you talked about your state experience. My question is, is there anything that you heard from governors today that made you specifically concerned about vulnerable populations, especially as I talked to Americans who say, “I don’t have the privilege to work from home. Well, as the President Elect shared with everyone, we heard a lot from the governors, including that, including the concern that African-Americans, Latinos, Native Americans, people who live in rural communities, people who, as groups of people, have historically been under resourced and underserved. And so there was consensus among the governors, bipartisan consensus, that our federal strategy should reflect those concerns in a way that we support the states with the resources they’ll need to get to the folks who have been often overlooked or ignored. And the President Elect, I think, has made it very clear that it’s one of our highest priorities to support that. As you may know, in the Senate, I actually led what we called Racial Disparities Task Force. And that approach is something that we will be incorporating in our administration to ensure that all people have equal access to resources, but also taking into account equitable distribution of resources based on need. Thank you, President Elect Biden and Vice President Elect Harris. One important thing to understand is there is a, and we’ve talked a lot about this and we’ve talked about it and talked about it when I was running, seeking the nomination as well. And that is that the idea of the brown, black, Asian American, Native American communities are always the first ones hit the hardest. And the last ones who are brought back. We’re going to flip that around. It’s going to be really important to determine priorities based upon access to the information that’s available, access to everything from the vaccine to other opportunities to be able to deal with helping the country, part of the country that’s hurt the worst. Three times as many African-Americans have died than white Americans died from COVID. So there has to be a prioritization. That’s why I’d like to know exactly what this administration has in mind in terms of their Operation Warp Speed and how they plan it. And that’s what we talked about with the governors today. They all mentioned the need to focus on communities that have been left behind, particularly Governor Cuomo. It’s one thing if, for example, vaccines are distributed to all the Walgreens of America. No criticism of Walgreens, but there’s a lot of those facilities that aren’t in rural communities and are not in poor communities, African-American, Latino communities. So we’ve got to make sure there’s access for them. Thank you so much. [crosstalk 00:26:16]. Okay. Thank you. Do you have room for Bernie Sanders in your cabinet? [crosstalk 00:26:24]"
"150","11-20-20"," Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining us for another fun Friday afternoon briefing from the Transition before I turn it over to my colleague Yohannes I just wanted to talk about a few of the things that happened this week. So, as you all know we are still waiting for the GSA administrator to ascertain the outcome of the election but we are still moving full steam ahead and so is of course President Elect Joe Biden and Vice-President Elect Kamala Harris. So this week President Elect Joe Biden and Vice-President Elect Kamala Harris had a pretty busy week. They had a week full of meetings with congressional leaders, governors, national security experts, CEOs and labor leaders, frontline workers. Earlier this week on Monday they hosted a meeting that included both CEOs and labor leaders to discuss ways to begin to put people back to work. And this is just a reminder that he’s somebody who can bring people together and convene them at this time when we need people to come from all sides to come together and address the crisis we’re facing. On Tuesday, the president elect and vice-president elect me with some of the country’s most experienced national security experts about the challenges facing our country and our institutions including the diplomatic defendence and intelligent challenges the administration will inherit on day one. And just as a reminder, these are meetings that of course he would probably have anyway, these are people that many of them he’s known for decades throughout his time and career working on foreign policy issues. But right now he is being shut out and the administration is being shut out of intelligence briefings and national security briefings that real-time information, threat assessments, data about the threats we’re facing around the world, our engagements around the world and information we need to get the pandemic under control. On Wednesday the president elect met with frontline workers hearing firsthand accounts from healthcare workers and first responders who were bearing the high emotional toll of helping others recover from COVID. And just yesterday, the president elect and the vice-president elect met with Democratic and Republican governors from the National Governor’s Association in a meeting, I should say, convened by the National Governors Association, and they talked about the importance of working together as one country to beat COVID. Addressing COVID and getting the pandemic under control is not a partisan issue, it’s not an issue that’s going to be solved by one party. It needs to be a something that’s done together with health experts and scientists and certainly leaders from both parties. And as you also may know today the president elect and vice president elect later this afternoon, I should say, will be meeting, will host Speaker Pelosi and Leader Schumer for a meeting in Wilmington. They’ll discuss emergency aid that families desperately need, small businesses need and state and local governments need at this critical point in time. Of course the president elect and he also named several members of his team, about a little more than a dozen including last week before we spoke of course he had named his White House chief of staff. And this week, including some this morning, they’ve announced several, a number of diverse, qualified and experienced individuals who will be filling important roles in the White House moving forward. And as we look ahead to next week and approach the Thanksgiving holiday he’s going to be focusing on continuing to address, be briefed on, speak out about the crises facing our country. We know this isn’t a holiday season that most people would have envisioned and they will continue to do the work to ensure that during next year’s holiday we can celebrate with our loved ones. So with that, I will turn it over to you on Yohannes. Thanks Jen and thanks everyone for making the time to be here. As Jen mentioned the GSA administrator has yet to ascertain the results of the election despite an overwhelming consensus that Joe Biden is the winner of the election and therefore the president elect. And as Jen also mentioned we continue to move forward in the absence of an ascertainment decision. However, the non-ascertainment does place limits on the resources available to the transition and most importantly our access to federal agencies. This isn’t a game, who gets to talk to whom, our inability to start our formal agency review process has the potential to have real impacts on families across the country. In fact, there’s a growing chorus of national leaders who are calling upon GSA to move forward with the transition and sounding the alarm about the potentially harmful impact of further delays. Earlier this week Dr. Fauci said that the lack of ascertainment would delay vaccine distribution. Leading medical groups including the American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association, and the American Nurses Association also wrote a letter urging the Trump administration to coordinate with the Biden transition on COVID 19 planning. Public health experts around the country echo these sentiments and call for the GSA to stop delaying ascertainment and ensure a seamless transition as COVID-19 infection rates surge across the country. Yesterday, numerous business leaders and groups released statements calling for the transition process to move forward, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, the Black Chamber of Commerce, the Business Round Table, the National Association of Manufacturers, Small Business for America’s Future and other leading business leaders. And finally, as Jen mentioned this week the president elect and the vice-president elect were briefed by former national security officials about the readiness of the diplomatic defense and intelligence agencies. As you know they are still not able to receive the critically important classified briefings that should be available to them. And so, the GSA administrator’s inaction has the potential to have a real impact on families across the country. Now even in the face of that, the transition team continues to do the work it is able to including the continued rollout of senior white house officials. Last week, we announced during this briefing that the public jobs portal would be open on the website and the personnel team is making strong progress and getting us ready to hit the ground on inauguration day with a diverse, talented team. So with that, I’d love to turn it over to a Q and A. Great thank you both. We’ll go to Lisa for our first question, Lisa [inaudible 00:07:11]. Great. Thank you guys for doing this. I really appreciate it. Hi Lisa. Hi guys. I’ve got a couple of questions. One, if generally you can talk about Vice-President Elect Harris’s role. She mentioned to reporters this week that she’s had a very tight role, an important role in the cabinet selections and just anything more on that would be great. And then also on the COVID relief bill that I know President Elect Biden’s talked a lot about. Is he lobbying members of Congress directly including today, Republicans and Democrats to pass something now? Talk to us about that. I’ll take the first question and Jen maybe you take the second one. The answer to the first question is easy in so much as Vice-President Elect Harris has been an integral part of all personnel discussions that happened during the transition and will continue to play that role. I will just add to your second question Lisa. So as you know, President Elect Biden and Vice-President Elect Harris will be meeting with Speaker Pelosi and Schumer later this afternoon. They are going to be working in lockstep and they’re in lockstep agreement that there needs to be emergency assistance and aid during the lame duck session to help families, to help small businesses. There’s no more room for delay and we need to move forward as quickly as possible. He of course is speaking with officials, elected officials from both sides of the aisle and will continue to do that. But it’s an important meeting this afternoon because they’re going to continue to work together on pushing that forward because they know how much that relief is needed especially as we look toward the Thanksgiving holiday. [inaudible 00:09:03] for you, but he’s been doing a range of calls. Well, thanks. Great. We’ll go to our next question from Amen Jabers. Yeah. Hey guys, thanks for doing this. I really appreciate the call. So earlier today a group called Demand Progress put out a list of democratic officials and veterans of previous administrations that it said, “We’re corporate Democrats and too close to oil and gas and other interests that they don’t like.” I’m wondering what effect that list which includes people like Bruce Reed and Steve Bruschetti is going to have on board decisions of how to staff up this White House. Well Amen thanks for the question and as you can see by the number of announcements that we’ve already made to date and the decisions that have been made by President Elect Biden and Vice-President Elect Harris they’re eager to get their team in place. There remains a commitment and we’ve certainly seen this as they’ve had discussions and made decisions already and you’ll see this as more names come out in the weeks to come that they want the cabinet and also the White House team and the teams that will fill these important roles to look like America. And that means there will be people from diverse backgrounds, diverse experiences, and a diversity of political views including from all sides of the democratic party. So we are certainly hearing from and listening to people and their thoughts and views but he’s made that commitment and I would encourage people to wait until we’ve made even one announcement about a cabinet member and certainly more than just a dozen White House names before they pass judgment. The last thing I would just say is that President Elect Biden is, he campaigned as somebody who would be governing for all of the country. That means Democrats, that means independents, that means Republicans, that means people from all political ideologies and his personnel decisions and his approach to how he’s going to fill those seats and fill the important roles will be reflective of that and that’s the approach he’ll continue to take. And Jen, thanks for that. Just one quick followup specifically on Wall Street. Well Amen I think from having lived through the Obama Biden, blissfully lived through, happily lived through the Obama Biden administration myself I think it’s pretty safe to thing to say that he’s not a fan of Wall Street policies or an advocate for a lot of the policies that some people would be in favor of or be pushing for from that end. His record speaks for itself and his advocacy and his words speak for themselves. And his team that he selects will be people who are implementing his policies, who are implementing the Biden agenda. They are people who are committed to putting Americans back to work, to ensuring there’s regulation where there needs to be, to ensuring that people have access to affordable healthcare. Those are the people who will be named to the cabinet and named to his team are there to implement his agenda. So, I would certainly point people to words he said and his own backgrounds over the last several years. Okay. Thanks guys. Great. It looks like our next question is from Sabrina Sidiki. Thank you both so much for doing this today. I just wanted to ask if there has been any outreach to the transition team whatsoever from current Trump administration officials and if so what has their message been to the transition team? And just the second question is President Elect Biden he said yesterday that he’s not ruling out legal action. Well, I’ll start and Yohannes may have some words of wisdom to add. So, on your second question the president elect has [inaudible 00:13:26] that and will certainly share this of course, given we all work for him that our preference would be for the GSA administrator to sign the ascertainment and we can all move forward. We can have access to intelligence briefings. We can have access to the information that’s necessary to have our team working on vaccine distribution, have access to the current information they need. We can ensure that there wouldn’t be a delay in Americans getting relief they need come January 20th. That’s our preference. At the same time, I think there’s a shared view or shared running out of patience happening that that’s happening as we can see on Capitol Hill, that’s happening with business leaders, that’s happening with national security officials. Because a smooth transition and a period of transition where the president elect, the vice president elect, national security officials and experts, experts who are helping us get the pandemic under control, have access to the anything that they may need is essential for our democracy and for our country. So, I would say we’ve seen that escalate externally and Yohannes started off mentioning a couple of the business leaders and business groups they want certainty in the economy. They know that if we have a delay in getting the information we need about vaccine distribution that could delay that moving forward. The Biden administration is going to be responsible for the distribution of the majority of 300 million vaccines. If that is delayed that could impact small businesses, that could impact the economy reopening. Everybody’s looking for certainty at this point. And the last thing I’ll just say is, no presidential transition would take options off the table and we certainly aren’t but we would love it if this afternoon or even during this call, during this briefing, if we learned that the GSA administrator signed the ascertainment and we could all move forward with continuing to prepare to govern. Great and we’ll take… Sorry Yohannes. The only thing I’d add there is we’re consulting with a broad range of stakeholders outside of the government that have expertise in various lanes that will be critical to governing. But at the end of the day exactly as Jen said there’s no replacing the real-time information that can only come from the post ascertainment environment that we should be in right now in terms of regularized contact and regular contact with folks inside of the agencies who have information that would be vital to everything from our national security to as Jen said vaccine distribution. So Sabrina it’s a great question and I know there’s been some confusion about this. Our teams can’t speak with or engage with current administration officials because the ascertainment has been delayed. And we would certainly love to have that engagement and love to be discussing with [inaudible 00:16:20] and people who have been experts on a range of issues from foreign policy to health policy preparations to take over January [inaudible 00:16:29] But our team has been very careful of course about following those rules and guidelines and we’ll have to abide by that until ascertainment happens. Great and we’ll take two more. We’ll move on to Arlette [inaudible 00:16:44]. Hi there. Yesterday, the president elect talked a little bit about his cabinet selections and I was wondering if you’d be able to provide a target date for when you are planning to roll out that first cabinet nominee. Sure well Arlette thank you for the question. So, I’ve been doing this long enough to know not to get ahead of the president elect and certainly when he’s ready to make his announcements about a cabinet he’ll do that. He indicated yesterday that that will be around Thanksgiving so that’s aligned with the timing of the announcement of cabinet nominees back in 2008 when I was working on the Obama transition. And I expect you’ll hear more from him on that soon. But since you gave us the opportunity I just wanted to say one thing about the cabinet and the nominees. He is committed to selecting [inaudible 00:17:44] and as the indicated selected some people who are qualified, who are experienced, who are going to be prepared on day one to address the crisis that our country is facing. And he will also put together a team that looks like America, that is diverse in terms of ideology and background as well. So, that’s how he’s looking at putting together his team. And we certainly saw today that there were a number of Republicans who have indicated they’d be open to supporting nominees. That feels like a positive sign because we know that the American people are not expecting an obstruction, they’re expecting members of both parties, Democrats and Republicans, to come together and help put qualified and experienced people in place to address the various crises that our country is facing. And I expect you’ll know more in the coming weeks. Thanks. And we’ll take our last question from Sam Stein. Hi guys. Thanks for doing this, much appreciated. This is a bit of a weird question but obviously as you’re planning for the transition this is happening during a spike in COVID and there’s articles about the difficulties in actually laying out the physical space of the White House and how to use it. So, our top priority as you saw in the campaign and certainly as you’ve seen throughout the transition is following the science and keeping the safety of our team top of mind. And it’s a dynamic situation with the pandemic but I think we’ll do the exact same adherence to and commitment to the science of keeping the team safe that you saw on the campaign, that you see during the transition. You’ll see that as we enter into the White House physical space. We don’t have anything to share on that at this moment but I think you can rest assured that we will follow the science and we’ll put procedures in place to keep our team safe. And as you can see Sam we are obviously not working in a transition office. I have children’s art and such things. And Yohannes obviously needs more pictures on his wall. But we also, president elect and the vice-president elect have conveyed to all of us that we should do our best to be model citizens as well which means being safe and I know this is about this moment of time being safe, of course wearing masks. Most of us are of course, the vast majority are working remotely because we want to be models for the country too. Thanks guys. Great. Well, thank you everybody for joining us and we’ll have plenty of news in the coming weeks that we’ll discuss with all of you."
"151","11-24-20"," Everybody, okay. Well, good afternoon, everyone. Today, I’m pleased to announce nominations and staff for critical foreign policy national security positions in my administration. It’s a team that will keep our country and our people safe and secure. And it’s a team that reflects the fact that America is back, ready to lead the world, not retreat from it. Once again sit at the head of the table. Ready to confront our adversaries and not reject our allies. Ready to stand up for our values. In fact, in calls from world leaders that I’ve had, about 18 or 20 so far, I’m not sure the exact number, in the week since we won the election, I’ve been struck by how much they’re looking forward to the United States reasserting its historic role as a global leader, both in the Pacific, as well as the Atlantic, all across the world. The team meets this moment, this team behind me. They embody my core beliefs that America is strongest when it works with it’s allies. Collectively, this team has secured some of the most defining national security and diplomatic achievements in recent memory, made possible through decades of experience working with our partners. That’s how we truly keep America safe, without engaging in needless military conflicts, and our adversaries in check, and terrorists at bay. And that’s how we counter terrorism and extremism, control this pandemic and future ones, deal with [inaudible 00:01:55] crisis, nuclear proliferation, cyber threats in emerging technologies that spread authoritarianism, and so much more. And while this team has unmatched experience and accomplishments, they also reflect the idea that we can not meet these challenges with old thinking and unchanged habits. For example, we’re going to have the first woman lead the intelligence community, the first Latino and immigrant to lead the Department of Homeland Security, and a groundbreaking diplomat at the United Nations. We’re going to have a principle on the National Security Council who’s full-time job is to fight climate change. For the first time ever that will occur. And my national security team will be coordinated by one of the youngest national security advisors in decades. Experience and leadership, fresh thinking and perspective, and an unrelenting belief in the promise of America. I’ve long said that America leads not only by the example of our power, but by the power of our example. And I’m proud to put forward this incredible team that will lead by example. As Secretary of State, I nominate Tony Blinken. He’s one of the better prepared for this job. No one’s better prepared in my view. He will be the Secretary of State who previously served in top roles on Capitol Hill, in the White House and in the State Department. He delivered for the American people in each place. For example, leading our diplomatic efforts and the fight against ISIS, strengthening America’s alliance and positions in the Asian-Pacific, guiding our responses to the global refugee crisis with compassion and determination. And he will rebuild morale and trust in the State Department, where his career in government began. And he starts off with the kind of relationships around the world that many of his predecessors have had to build over the years. I know, I’ve seen him in action. Tony’s been one of my closest and most trusted advisors. I know him and his family, immigrants and refugees, a Holocaust survivor, who taught him to never take for granted the very idea of America as a place of possibilities. Possibilities. Tony is ready on day one. As Secretary for Homeland Security, I nominate Alejandro Mayorkas. This is one of the hardest jobs in government, a gigantic agency. The DHS Secretary needs to keep us safe from threats at home and from abroad and it’s the job that plays a critical role in fixing our broken immigration system. After years of chaos, dysfunction and absolute cruelty a DHS, I’m proud to nominate an experienced leader who has been hailed by both Democrats and Republicans. Ally as he goes by is a former US attorney, former Director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services, and a former DHS Deputy Secretary. Helped implement DACA, prevented attacks on the homeland, enhanced our cybersecurity, helped communities recover from natural disaster, combated Ebola and Zika. And while DHS affects everyone, given it’s critical role in immigration matters I’m proud that for the first time ever the department will be led by an immigrant, a Latino, who knows that we are a nation of laws and values. And one more thing, today’s his birthday. Happy birthday, man, happy birthday. He’s 21. As a Director of National Intelligence, I nominate Avril Haine, the first woman ever to hold this post. To lead our intelligence community I didn’t pick a politician or a political figure. I picked a professional. She’s eminently qualified. Former Deputy Director of the CIA, former Deputy National Security Advisor to President Obama, and a fierce advocate for telling the truth and leveling with her decisions with the decision makers, straight up, nothing unnecessary. I know because I’ve worked with her for over a decade. Brilliant, humble, can talk literature and theoretical physics, fixing cars, flying planes, running a bookstore cafe, all in a single conversation, because she’s done all that. And above all, if she gets word of a threat coming to our shores, like another pandemic or a foreign interference in our elections, she will not stop raising alarms until the right people take action. People will be able to take her word because she always calls it as she sees it. I believe we are safer with Avril on a watch. I think she can make a great contribution. And as United States Ambassador to the United Nations I nominate Linda Thomas Greenfield. A seasoned and distinguished diplomat with 35 years in the foreign service who never forgot where she came from, growing up in segregated, Louisiana, the eldest of eight, her dad couldn’t read or write, but she said he was the smartest person she knew. First in her family to graduate from high school, then college, with the whole world literally ahead of her as her dad and mom taught her to believe. Post in Switzerland, Pakistan, Kenya, The Gambia, Nigeria, Jamaica, Liberia, where she was known as the people’s ambassador. Willing to meet with anyone, an ambassador, a student, working people struggling to get by, and always treating them with the same level of dignity and respect. She was our top State Department official in charge of African policy during the Ebola crisis. She received overwhelming support from her fellow career foreign service officers. And she’ll be a cabinet status because I want to hear her voice on all the major foreign policy discussions we have. And my National Security Advisor, I choose Jake Sullivan. He’s once in a generation intellect with experience and temperament for one of the toughest jobs in the world. When I was Vice President, he served as my National Security Advisor. He was a top advisor to Secretary of State Clinton. He helped lead the early negotiations that led to the Iran nuclear deal. He helped broker the Gaza ceasefire in 2012, played a key role in Asia Pacific rebalance in our administration, and in this campaign for the presidency he served as one of my most trusted advisors on both foreign and domestic policy, including help me develop our COVID-19 strategy. Jake understands my vision, that economic security is national security, and it helps steer what I call a foreign policy for the middle class, for families like his growing up in Minnesota, where he was raised by parents who were educators, and taught him the values of hard work, decency, service and respect. What that means is to win the competition for the future we need to keep us safe and secure, and build back better than ever. We need to invest in our people, sharpen our innovative edge, unite the economic might of our democracies around the world to grow the middle class, and reduce inequity and do things like counter predatory trade practices of our competitors and our adversaries. And before I talk about the final person today, let me talk about this new position. … participate in ministerial level meetings. And that’s a fancy way of saying they’ll have a seat at every table around the world. For the first time ever, there will be a principal on the NASA Security Council who can make sure climate change is on the agenda in the situation room. For the first time ever, we will have a Presidential Envoy on climate. He will be matched with high level White House climate policy coordinator and policymaking structure to be announced in December. And that’ll lead efforts here in the United States to combat the climate crisis, mobilize action, to meet the existential threat that we face. Let me be clear. I don’t for a minute underestimate the difficulties of meeting my bold commitments to fighting climate change. But at the same time, no one should underestimate for a minute my determination to do just that. And as for the man himself, if I had a former secretary of state who helped negotiate the Paris Climate Accord, or a former presidential nominee, or a former leading Senator, or the head of a major climate organization for the job, that would show my commitment to the United States and the whole world. The fact that I picked the one person who was all of these things speaks unambiguously to my commitment. The world will know that with one of my closest friends, John Kerry, he’s speaking for America on one of the most pressing threats of our time. No one I trust more. To this team, I thanked them for accepting this call to service. And for their families, I thank you all for your sacrifice. We could not do this without you, in my view. Together, these public servants will restore America globally, it’s global leadership, and it’s moral leadership. And will ensure that our service members, diplomats, and intelligence professionals can do their job free of politics. They’ll not only repair, they’ll also reimagine American foreign policy and NASA security for the next generation. And they’ll tell me what I need to know, not what I want to know, what I need to know. To the American people, this team will make us proud to be Americans. And as more states certify the results of this election, there’s progress to wrap up our victory. I’m pleased to have received the ascertainment from GSA to carry out a smooth and peaceful transition of power so our teams can prepare to meet the challenges at hand, to control the pandemic, to build back better, and to protect the safety and security of the American people. And to the United States Senate, I hope these outstanding nominees received a prompt hearing and that we can work across the aisle in good faith to move forward for the country. Let’s begin that work to heal and unite, to heal and unite America as well as the world. I want to thank you all. May God bless you. May God protect our troops. And now I turn this over, this new team, starting with our next secretary of state, Tony Blinken. Get my mask here, Tony, so I don’t get in trouble. And we’re going to clean off the podium. Good afternoon. Mr. President-elect, Vice President-elect Harris, thank you for your trust and your confidence. If confirmed by the United States Senate, I will do everything I can to earn it. Mr. President-elect, working for you, having you as a mentor and friend has been the greatest privilege of my professional life. So many people have brought me to this day. From college classmates to band mates, my colleagues in the Clinton and Obama administrations, in the Senate, and at the State Department. I thank them all. And I ask forgiveness for my insatiable appetite for bad puns. Mostly, I’d like to thank my family. Sisters and sisters-in-law, brothers-in-law, nieces and nephews, my wonderful in-laws, the Ryans, and especially my wife, Evan Ryan, and our children, John and Leila. They are truly my greatest blessings. For my family, as for so many generations of Americans, America has literally been the last best hope on earth. My grandfather, Maurice Blinken, fled pogroms in Russia and made a new life in America. His son, my father, Donald Blinken, served in the United States Air Force during World War II, and then as a United States ambassador. He is my role model and my hero. His wife, Vera Blinken, fled communist Hungary as a young girl and helped future generations of refugees come to America. My mother, Judith Pisar, builds bridges between America and the world through arts and culture. She is my greatest champion. And my late stepfather, Samuel Pisar, he was one of 900 children in his school in Bialystok, Poland, but the only one to survive the Holocaust after four years in concentration camps. At the end of the war, he made a break from a death march into the woods in Bavaria. From his hiding place, he heard a deep rumbling sound. It was a tank. But instead of the iron cross, he saw painted on its side a five pointed white star. He ran to the tank, the hatch opened, an African-American GI looked down at him. He got down on his knees and said the only three words that he knew in English that his mother taught him before the war, God bless America. That’s who we are. That’s what America represents to the world, however imperfectly. Now we have to proceed with equal measures of humility and confidence. Humility because, as the president-elect said, we can’t solve all the world’s problems alone. We need to be working with other countries. We need their cooperation. We need their partnership. But also confidence because America at its best still has a greater ability than any other country on earth to bring others together to meet the challenges of our time. And that’s where the men and women of the State Department, foreign service officers, civil service, that’s where they come in. I’ve witnessed their passion, their energy, their courage up close. I’ve seen what they do to keep us safe, to make us more prosperous. I’ve seen them add luster to a word that deserves our respect, diplomacy. If confirmed, it will be the honor of my life to help guide them. And so thank you all. And may God bless America. Good afternoon. Mr. President-elect, Madam Vice President-elect, thank you for placing your trust in me to lead the Department of Homeland Security. Thank you for the privilege of returning with the consent of the Senate to government service as a member of your administration. It is the honor of a lifetime. The Department of Homeland Security has a noble mission, to help keep us safe and to advance our proud history as a country of welcome. There are more than 240,000 career employees who selflessly dedicate their talent and energy to this mission. Many risks their lives in doing so. I would be honored to return to the department and support these dedicated public servants in fulfilling their responsibilities and realizing our country’s greatest hopes, all in partnership with the communities we serve. For 12 years, I had the privilege to stand in a federal courtroom and announce, “Alejandro Mayorkas on behalf of the United States of America.” The words “on behalf of the United States of America” meant everything to me and to my parents whom I think of today and every day. My father and mother brought me to this country to escape communism. They cherished our democracy and were intensely proud to become United States citizens, as was I. I have carried that pride throughout my nearly 20 years of government service and throughout my life. My parents are not here to see this day. Mr. President-elect, Madam Vice-President-elect, please know that I will work day and night in the service of our nation to ably lead the men and women of the United States Department of Homeland Security. … Men and women of the United States Department of Homeland Security, and to bring honor to my parents and to the trust you have placed in me to carry your vision for our country forward. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. President elect and Madam Vice President elect, I am grateful and even more so humbled by the trust that you’ve placed in me for this role. I’m especially honored to be standing not only by your side, but also alongside some of the most talented and inspiring public servants this country has ever seen. I know Mr. President elect and Madam Vice President elect, that you have selected us not to serve you, but to serve on behalf of the American people, to help advance our security, our prosperity, our values, that the call to service in this role is what makes this nomination such a tremendous honor. If reported the opportunity to do so, I will never forget that my role on this team is unique. Better than that of a policy advisor, I will represent to you, Congress, and the American public, the patriots who comprise our intelligence community. Mr. President elect, you know that I have never shied away from speaking truth to power. And that will be my charge as Director of National Intelligence. I’ve worked for you for a long time, and I accept this nomination knowing that you would never want me to do otherwise and that you value the perspective of the intelligence community and that you will do so even when what I have to say may be inconvenient or difficult. And I assure you, there will be those times. And finally, to our intelligence professionals, the work you do, oftentimes under the most austere conditions imaginable, is just indispensable. It will become even more complex because you will be critical to helping this administration position itself not only against threats such as cyber attacks or terrorism and the proliferation of nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons, but also those challenges that will define the next generation from climate change to pandemics and corruption. And it would be the honor of a lifetime to be able to work alongside you once again, to take these challenges on together. Thank you so much. Good afternoon. Mr. President elect, Madam Vice President elect, I’m humbled and honored by the trust that you’ve placed in me to become a member of your cabinet as Ambassador to the United Nations. In the years that I’ve worked in government, I’m always struck by how only in America would we be where we are today, where life can be hard and cruel, but there’s hope in the struggle. There’s promise in our dreams, where you learn to believe in yourself and that anything is possible. Like both of you, I learned from my family. Mr. President elect, thank you for those generous words that you said about me. My parents had very little back in Louisiana where I grew up, but they gave me and my siblings everything they had and I know how proud they would be of this day. On this day, I’m also missing my mentor, Ambassador Ed Perkins, who served as the US Ambassador to the United Nations under President George HW Bush and President Clinton. And who was also from Louisiana. He told me constantly, “Linda, don’t undersell yourself.” And he would always do everything possible to lift me up. He passed away last week, but I know he’s here with us today. And on this day, I’m thinking about the American people, my fellow career diplomats and public servants around the world. I want to say to you, “America is back, multi-lateralism is back. Diplomacy is back.” Mr. President elect, I’ve often heard you say how all politics is personal, and that’s how you build relationships of trust and bridge disagreements and find common ground. And in my 35 years in the foreign service across four continents, I put a Cajun spin on it. I called that gumbo diplomacy. Wherever I was posted around the world, I’d invite people of different backgrounds and beliefs to help me make a roux and chop onions for the Holy Trinity and make homemade gumbo. It was my way of breaking down barriers, connecting with people, and starting to see each other on a human level. A bit of lagniappe is what we say in Louisiana. That’s the charge in front of us today. The challenges we face, a global pandemic, a global economy, a global climate change crisis, mass migration and extreme poverty, social justice are unrelenting and interconnected, but they’re not unresolvable if America is leading the way. Thank you. Mr. President elect, Madam Vice President elect, thank you. Mr. President elect, I am honored and humbled by the immense responsibility that you’ve placed in me of being your National Security Advisor. I pledge to you and to the American people that I will work relentlessly in service of the mission you have given us to keep our country and our people safe, to advance our national interests, and to defend our values. I pledge to the exceptional national security team you see behind me and to the brilliant and diverse career professionals across our government, that I will manage a humane and rigorous decision making process that honors their work. And I pledge to my parents who taught my brothers, my sister and me to work hard, tell the truth, and serve others, that I will do my utmost to make you proud. Sir, we will be vigilant in the face of enduring threats from nuclear weapons to terrorism, but you have also tasked us with re-imagining our national security for the unprecedented combination of crises we face at home and abroad. The pandemic, the economic crisis, the climate crisis, technological disruption, threats to democracy, racial injustice, and inequality in all forms. The work of the team behind me today will contribute to progress across all of these fronts. You have also tasked us with putting people at the center of our foreign policy. You’ve told us that the alliances we rebuild, the institutions we lead, the agreements we sign, all of them should be judged by a basic question. Will this make life better, easier, safer for families across this country? Our foreign policy has to deliver for these families. And perhaps most importantly, you’ve tasked us with helping unite America, as you said in your remarks through our work to pull people together to tackle big challenges. My wife Maggie, the love of my life and my partner in all things, served as a Senior Advisor to Senator John McCain. She and I shared this commitment to common ground deep in our bones. To the American people, I have the honor of serving as Joe Biden’s security advisor when he was Vice President. I’ve learned a lot about a lot. About diplomacy, about strategy, about policy, but most importantly, about human nature. I watched him pair strength and resolve with humanity and empathy. That is the person America elected, and that is also America at its best. So Mr. President elect, thank you for giving this kid from the heartland and extraordinary opportunity to serve the country I love. Mr. President elect, Vice President elect Harris. Thank you, Mr. President elect for your generous words. … Your generous words. And most of all, thank you for the trust and the responsibility of this appointment. I will do all, in my power, to live up to your expectations and to this moment for our country and for the world. And I began by thanking my family for empowering me and encouraging me to take this task on. Secretary designate Blinken, we’ve worked together for many years on the Foreign Relations Committee and at Foggy Bottom. And it will be a huge pleasure to partner with you again. You will be a terrific secretary. Mr. President-elect you’ve put forward a bold transformative climate plan. But you’ve also underscored that no country alone can solve this challenge. Even the United States, for all of our industrial strength, is responsible for only 13% of global conditions. To end this crisis, the whole world must come together. You’re right to rejoin Paris on day one. And you’re right to recognize that Paris alone is not enough. At the global meeting in Glasgow, one year from now, all nations must raise ambition together, or we will all fail together. And failure is not an option. Succeeding together means tapping into the best of American ingenuity, creativity, and diplomacy, from brain power to alternative energy power, using every tool we have to get where we have to go. No one should doubt the determination of this president, vice-president. They shouldn’t doubt the determination of a country that went to the moon, cured, supposedly incurable diseases and beat back global tyranny, beat world war to win World War II. This kind of crisis demands that kind of thing leadership again. And President Biden will provide it. The road ahead is exciting, actually. It means creating millions of middle-class jobs. It means less pollution in our air or ocean. It means making life healthier for citizens across the world. And it means we will strengthen the security of every nation in the world. In addressing the climate crisis, President-elect Joe Biden is determined to seize the future now, and leave a healing planet to future generations. 57 years, this week, Joe Biden and I were college kids when we lost the president who inspired both of us to try to make a difference. A president who reminded us that here on Earth, God’s work must truly be our own. President Joe Biden will trust in God, and he will also trust in science to guide our work on earth to protect God’s creation. Mr. President-elect, the vice-president-elect Harris, I look forward to getting to work. Thank you. Thank you, Secretary Kerry. And congratulations Mr. President-elect on bringing together this extraordinary team. I have always believed in the nobility of public service and these Americans embody it. Their lives and careers are a Testament to the dedication, sacrifice, and commitment to civic responsibility that has strengthened our democracy and kept America’s promise alive for more than 200 years. President-elect Biden and I have long known that when we were elected, we would inherit a series of unprecedented challenges upon walking into the White House. Addressing these challenges starts with getting this pandemic under control, opening our economy responsibly, and making sure it works for working people. And we also know that our challenges will require us here at home to overcome those issues that block our ability to proceed. Our challenge here is a necessary foundation for restoring and advancing our leadership around the world. And we are ready for that work. We will need to reassemble and renew America’s alliances, rebuild and strengthen the national security and foreign policy institutions that keep us safe and advance our nation’s interests. And confront and combat the existential threat of climate change that endangers us all. I take these issues very seriously. My whole career has been about keeping people safe from serving as district attorney to California’s Attorney General to the United States Senate, where I have served on the Intelligence and Homeland Security committees. I’ve come to know firsthand the gravity of the challenges and threats facing the United States. And over the past few months, I’ve also come to know the sound judgment, expertise, and character of the people on this stage. I can say with confidence that they are to a person, the right women and men for these critical positions. And I look forward to working alongside them on behalf of the American people. And on behalf of a president who will ask tough questions, demand that we be guided by facts and expect our team to speak the truth no matter what. A president who will be focused on one thing and one thing only, doing what is best for the people of the United States of America. When Joe asked me to be his running mate, he told me about his commitment, to making sure we selected a cabinet that looks like America, that reflects the best of our nation. And that’s what we have done. Today’s nominees and appointees come from different places. They bring a range of different life and professional experiences and perspectives. And they also share something else in common, and unwavering belief in America’s ideals and unshakeable commitment to democracy, human rights, and the rule of law. And they understand the indispensable role of America’s leadership in the world. These women and men are patriots and public servants to their core. And they are leaders, the leaders we need to meet the challenges of this moment and those that lie ahead. Thank you. [inaudible 00:38:05]. All right thank you folks. [crosstalk 00: 08:12]."
"152","11-25-20"," Authorized by the Continental Congress, took place on December 18th, 1777. Was celebrated by General George Washington and his troops at Gulph Mills on the way to Valley Forge. And it took place under extremely harsh conditions in deprivation, lacking food, clothing, shelter. They’re preparing to ride out a long, hard winter. And today you can find a plaque in Gulph Mills marking that moment. Here’s what the plaque reads. It says, “This Thanksgiving in spite of the suffering showed the reverence in character that was forging the soul of a nation.” Forging the soul of a nation, faith, courage, sacrifice, service to country, service to each other and gratitude, even in the face of suffering, have long being part of what Thanksgiving means in America. Now, looking back over our history, you see that it’s been in the most difficult circumstances that the soul of our nation has been forged. And now we find ourselves again, facing a long, hard winter. We fought nearly a year long battle with a virus that has devastated this nation. This brought us pain and loss and frustration. And has cost so many lives, 260000 Americans and counting. It’s divided us, angered us, set us against one another. I know the country has grown wary of the fight. We need to remember we’re war with the virus, not with one another, not with each other. This is the moment where we need to instill our spines, redouble our efforts and recommit ourselves to the fight. Let’s remember, we’re all in this together. Sounds trite to say, but we’re all in this together. For so many of us, it’s hard to hear this fight isn’t over. We still have months of this battle ahead of us. For those who have lost a loved one, I know that this time of year can be especially difficult. Believe me. I know. I remember that first Thanksgiving. The empty chair, the silence, takes your breath away. It’s really hard to care. It’s hard to give thanks. It’s hard to even think of looking forward and it’s so hard to hope. I understand. Can’t be thinking and praying for each and every one of you at this Thanksgiving. At your Thanksgiving table, because we’ve been there. This year, we’re asking Americans to forego so many of the traditions that we’ve long made this holiday, which made it so special. For our families, for 40 some years, we’ve had a tradition of traveling over Thanksgiving. Tradition that we’ve kept every year, save one. The year our son Beau die. But this year we’ll be staying home. We’ve always had a big family gathering at Thanksgiving. Kids, grandkids, aunts, uncles, brothers, sisters, and more. With The Bidens, the days around Thanksgiving have always been a time to remember all we had to be grateful for and a time to begin to think about Christmas and begin even to do the Christmas list. But this year, because we care so much for each other, we’re going to be having a separate Thanksgiving. For Jill and I, we’ll be at our home in Delaware with our daughter and our son-in-law. The rest of the family will be doing the same thing in small groups. So I know how hard it is to forgo family traditions, but it’s so very important. Our country’s in the middle of a dramatic spike in cases. We’re now averaging 160000 new cases a day. No one would be surprised if we hit 200000 cases in a single day. Many local health systems are at risk of being overwhelmed. That’s the plain and simple truth. Nothing made up. It’s real. And I believe you always deserve to hear the truth. Hear the truth from your president. We have to try to slow the growth of this virus. We owe it to the doctors and the nurses and other frontline workers, care workers who’ve risked their lives. Some lost their lives. Put so much on the line in a heroic battle in this virus against it for so long. We owe that to our fellow citizens who need access to hospital beds and care to fight this disease. We owe it to one another. It’s literally our patriotic duty as Americans. It means wearing a mask, keeping social distancing, limiting the size of any group we’re in. Until we have a vaccine, these are the most effective tools to combat the virus. Starting on day one of my presidency, we will take steps that will change the course of this disease. More testing. We’ll find people with cases and get them away from one another, slowing the number of infections. More protective gear for businesses and our schools to do the same, reducing the number of cases. Clear guidance, we’ll get more businesses and more schools open. We all have a role to play in beating this crisis. The federal government has vast powers to combat the virus. And I commit to you, I will use all of those powers to lead a national coordinated response, but the federal government can’t do this alone. Each of us has a responsibility in our own lives, do what we can do to slow the virus. Every decision we make matters. Every decision we make can save lives. None of these steps we’re asking people to take are political statements. Every one of them is based on science, real science. And the good news is there has been significant record-breaking progress made recently in developing a vaccine. And several of these vaccines look extraordinarily effective. And it happens that we’re on track for the first immunization to begin by late December, early January. Then we’ll need to put in place a distribution plan to get the entire country immunized as soon as possible, which we will do, but it’s going to take time. I’m hoping the news of the vaccine will serve as an incentive to every American, to take these simple steps to get control of the virus. There’s real hope, tangible hope. So, hang on. Don’t let yourselves surrender to the fatigue, which I understand it is real fatigue. I know we can, and we will beat this virus. America’s not going to lose this war. We’ll get our lives back. Life is going to return to normal, I promise you. This will happen. This will not last forever. So yes, it’s been a really hard year, particularly hard for over 250000 people and their families. But I still believe we have much to be thankful for. There’s so much to hope for. Much to build on. Much to dream up. Here’s the America I see. And I believe it’s the America you see as well. America that faces facts. America that overcomes challenges. An America where we seek justice and equality for all people. An America that holds fast to the conviction that out of pain comes possibility, out of frustration comes progress and out of division unity. You all know in our finest hours, that’s who we’ve always been and that’s what we shall be again. I believe that this grim season of division, demonization is going to give way to a year of light and immunity. Why do I think so? Because America is a nation not of adversaries, but of neighbors. Not of limitations, but of possibilities. Not of dreams deferred, but of dreams realized. I’ve said many times that this is a great country. We are a good people. This is the United States of America. And there’s never been anything we’ve been unable to do when we’ve done it together. Think of what we come through. As a nation, how many things we’ve come through? Centuries of human enslavement, cataclysmic civil war, exclusion of women from the ballot box, world wars, Jim Crow, the long twilight struggle against Soviet tyranny that could have ended not in the fall of the Berlin Wall, but a nuclear Armageddon. Look, I’m not naive. I know that history is just that, history. But to know what came before, what come before, what’s happened before, can help arm us against despair. Knowing that previous generations got through the same universal human challenge that we face, the tension between selfishness and generosity, between fear and hope, between division and unity. What was it that brought the reality of America into closer alignment with the promise of reality, justice and prosperity? It sounds corny, but it was love, plain and simple. Love of country. Love of one another. We don’t talk much about loving our politics. The political run is too loud, too angry, too heated. To love our neighbor as ourselves is a radical act. It is what we’re called to do. We must try. Only in trying, only in listening, only in seeing ourselves as bound together. And what Dr. King called the mutual garment of destiny, can we rise above divisions and truly heal. Look, we all know America is never been perfect. We’ve always tried to fulfill the aspiration of the Declaration of Independence, that all people are created equal, created in the image of God. And then we’ve always sought to form a more perfect union. What should we give thanks for this season? Well, first let’s be thankful for democracy itself. In this last election, one that just took place, we’ve seen record numbers of Americans exercise the most sacred rights, that of the vote to register their will at the ballot box. Think about that. In the middle of a pandemic, more people voted this year than have ever voted in the history of the United States of America. Over 150 million people cast a ballot. Simply extraordinary. Many waiting in line five, six, seven, eight hours to vote. If you want to know what beats deep in the heart of America? It’s this, democracy, the right to determine our lives, our government and our leaders. The right to be heard. Our democracy was tested this year. And what we learned is this, the people of this nation are up to the task. In America, we have full and fair and free elections. And then we honor the results. The people of this nation and the laws of the land won’t stand for anything else. Through the vote, the noblest instrument of non-violent protest ever conceived. We remained a new and reminded a new, that progress is possible that, we, the people, have the power to change, what Jefferson called the course of human events. Now, with our hearts and our hands and our voices, today, we can be better than yesterday and tomorrow, we can be still better than that day. We should be thankful too, that America is a covenant, an unfolding story. We have what we need to create prosperity, opportunity and justice. Americans have grit and generosity, a capacity for greatness and reservoirs of goodness. We have what it takes. Now, we have to act. This is our moment. Ours together to write a newer, bolder, more compassionate chapter in the life of the nation. The work ahead is not going to be easy. It will not be quick. You want solutions, not shouting, reasons, not hyper-partisanship, light, not heat. You want us to hear one another again, see one another again, respect one another again. You want Democrats and Republicans, and independents to come together and work together. And that my friends is what I’m determined to do. America is dream big. As hard as it may seem this Thanksgiving, we’re going to dream big again. Our future is bright. In fact, I’ve never been more optimistic about the future America than I am right now. I honest to God, believe that 21st century is going to be an American century. We’re going to build an economy that leads the world. We’re going to lead the world by the power of our example, not just the example of our power. We’re going to lead the world on climate and save this planet. We’re going to find cures for cancer and Alzheimer’s and diabetes. I promise you. We’re going to finally root out systemic racism in this country. I miss Thanksgiving and anticipation of all the Thanksgivings that come. Let’s dream again. Let’s commit ourselves to thinking not only of ourselves, but of others as well. For if we care for one another, if we open our arms rather than brandishing our fist, we can with the help of God heal. And if we do, and I’m sure we can, we can claim the promised. With the promise who wrote these following words. The Lord is my strength and my shield, and with my song I give thanks to him. I give thanks now for you, for the trust you’ve placed in me. Together, we’ll lift our voices in the coming months and years. And our songs shall be of lives saved, bridges repaired, a nation made whole again. Folks from the Biden family to yours, wherever and however, you may be celebrated. We wish you a happy Thanksgiving. May God bless you and may God protect our troops. Happy Thanksgiving."
"153","12-01-20"," Well, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for being here. Hope everyone had a enjoyable and safe Thanksgiving, even if it was far from the traditional large gathering of family and friends, apart from many we loved, but I hope you had a good Thanksgiving. And I know times are tough, but I want you to know that help is on the way. Last week, I announced the nominations and staff for Critical Foreign Policy and National Security positions. A first rate team that’s going to keep us safe and secure. And today I have the pleasure of announcing key nominations and appointments for the critical economic positions in the administration. A first rate team that’s going to get us through this ongoing economic crisis and help us build the economy back, not just build it back, but build it back better than it was before. A team that’s tested and experienced and includes groundbreaking Americans who come from different backgrounds, but who share my core vision for economic relief here in the United States of America, and given a fair shot and an equal chance, there’s nothing, we all believe there’s nothing beyond the capacity of the American people. Let’s not forget who built this country, working class and middle-class people built this country, and unions built the middle class. And from the most unequal economic and job crisis in modern history, we can build a new American economy that works for all Americans, not just some, all. We need to act now, though. And we need to work together. In the week since winning the election, Vice President Harris and I have covered meetings with a number of people. We convened meetings with labor leaders and CEOs at the same time, mayors and governors of both political parties. There’s a consensus out there, that as we battle the COVID-19 disease, we have to make sure that business and workers have the tools, resources, and guidance, and the health and safety standards to be able to operate safely. The goal is simple, to keep businesses and schools open safely, and for millions of Americans who have lost their jobs or hours and have had to claim unemployment, we have to deliver them immediate relief. That includes affordable health care for millions of people who have lost it and are in danger of losing it. Childcare, sick leave, family leave, so workers don’t have to choose between work and family. Relief from rent and student loans. We need to support small businesses and entrepreneurs who formed the backbone of the communities that we live in, that are teetering on the edge. Know there’s an urgent need to fund state and cities so they can, the frontline workers on those jobs can stay in the jobs. You know, the founders are pretty smart. I could have gotten this lesson from the future Secretary of the Treasury, and there’s a reason why all the States and localities have to have a balanced budget, but we’re allowed federally to run a deficit in order to deal with crises and emergencies, and we have in the past, and we have to keep vital public services running. We have to give aid to local and State governments to make sure they can have law enforcement officers, firefighters, educators, as we did in the recovery act of 2009. And right now the full Congress should come together and pass a robust package for relief to address these urgent needs. But any package passed in a lame duck session is likely to be at best, just a start. My transition team is already working on what I’ll put forward in the next Congress to address the multiple crises we’re facing, especially our economic and COVID crisis. And the team I’m announcing today will pay a critical role in shaping our plan for action, starting on day one, and move fast to revive this economy. They’re going to help me, help us, help the country lay out my [inaudible 00:06:10] better plan, a plan that an independent analysis from Moody’s, a well-respected Wall Street firm, projected would create 18.6 million jobs. It’s based on a simple proposition, reward hard work in America, not wealth. It’s time to invest in infrastructure, clean energy, climate change, manufacturing, and so much more that will create millions of good paying jobs. It’s time we address the structural inequities in our economy that this pandemic has laid bare. Economists call this current economy and recovery K shaped. Well, like the two lines coming off of a K. Some people are seeing their prospects soar upward while others are watching their economic prospects drop sharply. For those at the top, jobs have come back, their wealth is rising. For example, luxury home sales are up over 40% compared to last year, but for those in the middle and the bottom, it’s a downward slide. They’re left figuring out how to pay the bills and put food on the table. Almost one in every six renters was behind in rent payments as of October. Let me be clear, with this team and others we’ll add in the weeks ahead, that we’re going to create a recovery for everybody, for all. We’re going to get this economy moving again. We’re going to create jobs, raise incomes, reduce drug prices, advance racial equity across the economy and restore the backbone of this country, the middle class. Our message to everybody struggling right now is this, help is on the way. My dad, you’ve heard me say this before, when he lost his job in Scranton, when I was a kid, and we eventually moved the family not far from here, Claymont, Delaware, just in the outskirts of Wilmington, used to say, “Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity, it’s about respect, your place in the community. It’s about being able to look a kid in the eye and say, “Honey, it’s going to be okay,” and mean it.” Also used to say, “Joey, I don’t expect the government to solve my problems, but I do expect them to understand my problems.” This team understands. For Secretary of Treasury, I am really pleased to be able to nominate Janet Yellen. No one is better prepared to deal with these crisis. I wish it weren’t as much of a crisis, Future Secretary. She’ll be the first Treasury Secretary who was also Chair of the Federal Reserve, Vice Chair of the Federal Reserve and Chair of the President’s Council of Economic Advisors. Janet is one of the most important economic thinkers of our time. She has spent her career focused on unemployment and the dignity of work, which is really important to me and to all of us. She understands what it means to people and their communities when they have good, decent jobs, respect across… Be looked at by their neighbors and be respected, it matters a lot to them. And respected across party lines and around the world by main street and Wall Street, an educator, a mentor, above all the daughter of a working class, from a working class, Brooklyn neighborhood, who never forgot where she came from. Her husband, George is pretty good too. He’s won a Nobel Prize, but he’s the one that married up. Jan will be the first woman to hold this office. We might have to ask Lin-Manuel Miranda who wrote the musical about the first Secretary of Treasury, Hamilton, to write another musical about the first woman Secretary of the Treasury, Yellen. So that’s what I’m working on right now, Janet. For Director of Office of Managing the Budget, I nominate Neera Tanden. I’ve known Neera a long time, a brilliant policy mind with critical, practical experience across government. She was raised by a single mom on food stamps, an immigrant from India who struggled, worked hard, and did everything she could for her daughter to live out the American dream and Neera did just that. She understands the struggles that millions of Americans are facing. And she’ll be the first woman of color from South Asia, and I think that, to lead OMB. We also have another one of those women as Vice President of the United States of America. And so look, all, being very serious. She’ll be in charge of laying out the budget that will help us control the virus and deal with the economic crisis and build back better. But above all, she believes what I believe, a budget should reflect our values. Again, quoting my dad, for real, my dad’s people would say, “Joe, let me tell you what I value.” And they look at him, as a high school educated guy, very well-read and he looked at me said, “Don’t tell me what you value. Show me your budget. I’ll tell you what you value.” That’s what you’re going to do for us Neera. As Deputy Secretary of Treasury, I nominate Wally Adeyemo. Now, Wally is a… You know, Wally, I don’t know. I tell you what, Senator Warren really likes you. She highly recommended you, but I wasn’t sure she worried that I stole you as well, but thank you for being willing to do this, Wally. Macro economics to consumer protection and from national security international affairs. I’ve worked with Wally during the great recession. That was me my excuse to the Senator saying, that’s why I wanted to steal you. And I saw him tackle one big job after another, deputy national security advisor to president Obama, deputy director for the national economic council, former chief of staff for Elizabeth Warren, where he helped create the consumer protection Bureau and financial Bureau, which has done so much good. It’s designed to protect consumers and working people from unfair, deceptive, and abusive financial practices. And now Wally will be the first African-American ever to hold this post and the highest ranking African-American in the treasury department’s history. An immigrant from Nigeria. A son of a nurse and an elementary school principal. Wally understands everything we do is basically for the people. For families. Hard working people. To understand their struggles and most of all their dreams. He understands both. And I want to thank you Wally, for being willing to do this for it. For chairperson of council of economic advisors I nominate … Notwithstanding, she was a very distinguished professor at Princeton. I joke, my children who went to Penn and you just always kid about, you know … But Cecilia Cece Rouse, one of the most distinguished economists in the country. An expert on labor economics and race, poverty and education. Dean of the Princeton school of public and international affairs. A member of the council of economic advisors to president Obama and advisor to president Clinton at the national economic council. More than that, she’s a proud daughter whose mom, a school psychologist encouraged her to pursue economics and her dad, one of the country’s first African-American astrophysics, who dared her to dream. She’s done both. If confirmed Cece will be the first … Excuse me, the fourth woman to lead the council of national economic advisers and the first African-American ever to hold that post. And as CEA chair she’ll serve as a member of my cabinet, as well. As a member for the council of economic advisors we also appoint Jared Bernstein, an old friend who’s been with me a long time. A brilliant thinker. A quick wit with a heart, as big as his head. A heart he got from his mom and educator, who raised him correctly. A social worker turned economist, Jared is one of my closest economic advisers and friend. He served as my chief economist during the vice presidency. He was there in that foxhole during the great recession with the economy to be on the brink and our country on our back. I couldn’t think of anyone else who I want to be on my side to face the challenges ahead. Jared will be one of the leading voices of my administration on economic policy. I can always count on him to deliver straight from the shoulder as his hero FDR used to say. Straight from the shoulder. The one thing I can assure is working people always have a voice with Jared in this council. As a member of the council of economic advisers I appoint Heather Boushey. Heather, thank you for all the help you had in the transition team and getting me here. She’s one of the foremost economists working to make sure we build an economy that works for all Americans. The daughter of a union family, it’s no wonder she believes so deeply in the idea, leave no one out. Leave no one behind in this economy during the campaign I relied on our council on addressing the structural inequities within the economy. And I’ll do so again as president because that’s one of the central issues of our time. To this team, thank you for accepting the call to serve again. To your families and to your … Thank them for their sacrifices. Because there’s real sacrifice. We could not do this without you. And to the American people. This team will always be there for you and your families. This is family oriented team. We got to make sure ordinary people get a chance to do well, because when given a chance they’ve never, ever, ever, ever let the country down. 11 years ago, president Obama and I entered office during the great recession and implemented the Recovery Act and saved us from a great depression. I didn’t see the map of America at the time, nor did he in terms of blue states and red states. We only saw the United States of America. We work with everyone, for everyone, and we recovered and rebuilt together as one nation. Vice president Harris and I will do that all over again with an outstanding team. They’re ready on day one. To the United States Senate, I hope these outstanding nominees will receive a prompt hearing and that we will be able to work across the aisle in good faith and move forward as one country. Let’s begin the work to heal, to unite, to rebuild an economy for all Americans. They deserve and expect nothing less. Thank you. May God bless you. And may God protect our troops. I now turn this over to the new team, starting with our next secretary of treasury, Janet Yellen. Again, Janet, thanks for accepting. I appreciate it. I think they’re going to clean this off for us here. Excuse me, Janet. Is my mask up there? No, I put in in my book. [inaudible 00:18:14]. Thank you, Mr president elect and Madam vice president elect. It’s my great honor to have this opportunity to serve you and the American people and to join this incredible economic team at this moment of great challenge for our country. Mr President elect, when you reflect on what your father taught you about how a job is much more than a paycheck I hear my own father who raised our family in working class Brooklyn. When he graduated from medical school, during the great depression, he looked for a home in a place to hang his shingle near the Brooklyn docks. Back then Bush terminal on the upper New York Bay was a thriving hub for manufacturing and transportation and for the union workers whose livelihoods depended on them. Knowing they didn’t have cars, my father found a home near a bus line. He started his family practice in the basement. While we lived on the floors above. At the end of the day, he would talk to me, my brother and my mom about what work meant to his patients, our friends and neighbors, especially if they lost a job. The financial problems, the family problems, the health problems, the loss of dignity and self-worth. The value of work always stuck with me. So much so that I became an economist because I was concerned about the toll of unemployment on people, families, and communities. And I’ve spent my career trying to make sure people can work and achieve the dignity and self-worth that comes with it. Mr President elect, I know you’ve done the same. I saw it that understanding during the last great recession and the recovery act that followed and now we’re facing historic crises again. The pandemic and economic fallout fit together have caused so much damage for so many and have had a disproportionate impact on the most vulnerable among us. Lost lives, lost jobs, small businesses struggling to stay alive or closed for good. So many people struggling to put on the table and pay bills and rent. It’s an American tragedy and it’s essential that we move with urgency. Inaction will produce a self-reinforcing downturn causing yet more devastation. And we risk missing the obligation to address deeper structural problems, inequality, stagnant wages, especially for workers who lack a college education. Communities that have seen industry disappear with no good jobs replacing lost ones. Racial disparities in pay, job opportunities, housing, food security, and small business lending that deny wealth building to communities of color. Gender disparities that keep women out of the workforce and keep our economy from running at full force. It’s a convergence of tragedies that is not only economically unsustainable, but one that betrays our commitment to giving every American an equal chance to get ahead. But I know this team will never give up that commitment. As you’ve said before, Mr president elect, out of our collective pain as a nation, we will find collective purpose to control the pandemic and build our economy back better than before. To rebuild our infrastructure and create better jobs, to invest in our workforce, to advance racial equity and make sure that the economic recovery includes everyone. To address the climate crisis with American ingenuity and American jobs. Working together with the outstanding national security and foreign policy team you announced last week to help restore America’s global leadership. And above all, we share your belief in the American dream. Of a society, where each person, with effort, can rise to their potential and dream even bigger for their children. I pledge as treasury secretary to work every day towards rebuilding that dream for all Americans. And to the great public servants of the treasury department I look forward to working with you and Wally to rebuild the public trust. To the American people we will be an institution that wakes up every morning, thinking about you, your jobs, your paychecks, your struggles, your hopes, your dignity, and your limitless potential. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. President-elect, Madam Vice President-elect, I’m humbled and honored by the trust you’ve placed in me to work with this talented team on behalf of the American people. I’m especially proud to work alongside leaders who understand that budgets are not abstractions. They are a reflection of our values. They touch our lives in profound ways, and sometimes they make all the difference. Like the vice president-elect’s mother Shyamala, my mother Maya was born in India. Like so many millions across every generation, she came to America to pursue a better life. I was raised in a suburb of Boston. A middle-class kid. But when I was five, my parents got divorced and my mom was left on her own with two young children and without a job. She faced a choice. Return to India, where at a time, divorce was stigmatized and the opportunities for her and her children would be limited. Or, keep fighting for her American dream. She stayed. And America came through for her when times were tough. We relied on food stamps to eat. We relied on Section 8 housing vouchers to pay the rent. We relied on the social safety net to get back on our feet. This country gave her a fair shot to reach the middle-class and she made it work. She got a job as a travel agent and before long, she was able to buy us our own home in Bedford, Massachusetts, and eventually see her children off to college and beyond. I’m here today, thanks to my mother’s grit, but also thanks to a country that had faith in us. That invested in her humanity and in our dreams. I’m here today because of social programs, because of budgetary choices, because of a government that saw my mother’s dignity and gave her a chance. Now it is my profound honor to help shape those budgets and programs, to keep lifting Americans up, to pull families back from the brink, to give everybody the fair chance my mom got and that every single person deserves. That’s the America, Maya and Shyamala were drawn to. The America the president-elect and vice president-elect are ready to grow. I believe so strongly that our government is meant to serve all the American people. Republicans, Democrats, and Independents alike. All of whom deserve to know their government has their back. I look forward to working together alongside the dedicated career professionals of the OMB to expand possibilities for every American family. I want to thank my own wonderful family. My husband, Ben, without his love and support, I would simply not be here. And our children, Elina and Jayden. Thank you all for this profound opportunity to serve. Thank you. Mr. President-elect, Madam Vice President-elect, thank you for this profound opportunity to return to the Treasury Department and serve the American people. I know firsthand the president- elect’s capacity to lift our country out of hard times, because I had the privilege of working with him to help Americans recover from the Great Recession. In California’s inland empire, where I’d grown up in a working class neighborhood, the Great Recession hit us hard. We were one of the foreclosure capitals in the United States. The pain of this was real for me. It wasn’t just numbers in a report or stories on the nightly news, but neighbors and friends who lost everything. I was proud of the work I got to do with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, protecting American consumers at the Treasury Department, helping to grow the US economy. I was proud also of getting a chance to serve with leaders like the president-elect, who oversaw the Recovery Act’s implementation. Investing in American workers, betting on their resilience and drive and giving families a chance to get up off the mat. I believe that’s what public service is all about at its best. Giving people a fair shot when they need it most, offering hope through the dark times, and making sure that our economy works not just for the wealthy, but for the hardworking people who make it run. Those are the lessons I learned from my parents. An elementary school principal and a nurse who came to America to build a better life for me and my siblings. They taught us that we have a responsibility to serve our community and the country that gave us so many opportunities. But I also learned early on how much more needs to be done to ensure that everyone has a fair chance they deserve. I look forward to working with Janet Yellen to reduce inequality in this country and expand the middle-class and make sure that we build an economy that works for everyone. And as we build back better, we must also remain laser-focused on the Treasury Department’s critical role of protecting our national security. This includes using our sanctions regime to hold bad actors accountable, dismantling the financial networks of terrorist organizations and others who seek to do us harm, and ensuring our foreign investment policy protects America’s national security interest. The challenges before us today are unlike anything we have ever faced, but I know that what the president-elect so often reminds us of is true. The American people can do anything when given a chance. I’m honored to be a part of this talented team and to work with them and all of the American people to build an economy that gives everyone that chance and turns our nation once again from crisis to hope. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Good afternoon. Mr. President-elect, Madam Vice President-elect, thank you for this extraordinary opportunity to join this team. I’m humbled and honored and ready to get to work for the American people. To be perfectly honest, until recently, I did not anticipate I would return to public service. As every academic knows, when you’ve laid down roots at a school you love with incredible students and colleagues you’ve grown with, it isn’t easy to take a leave. It requires a rare combination of urgency and opportunity to pull you away. But that rare combination is precisely what our nation is facing right now. My path as an economist began in my first year of college. My mother, the school psychologist encouraged me to take a course in economics and it happened to coincide with what at the time was one of the worst spikes in unemployment since the Great Depression. It was impossible for me to separate what we were learning in the classroom, from what I know was going on in towns across the country. I found myself drawn to the study of the labor market in all of its dimensions. The reasons that jobs disappear. The impact of education on people’s job prospects. And the ways we can tear down barriers to job growth and make it easier for people to find long lasting economic security. Today, nearly 40 years later, we are once again living through one of the worst job crises since the Great Depression. Millions of families have had their lives turned upside down. The safety net has frayed, leaving vulnerable Americans to slip through into hardship and hopelessness. And importantly, structural inequities that have always existed in our economy are being exacerbated like never before. This is a moment of urgency and opportunity unlike any we’ve faced in modern times. The urgency of ending a devastating crisis and the opportunity to build a better economy in its wake. An economy that works for everyone, brings fulfilling job opportunities and leaves no one to fall through the cracks. I look forward to working with the president-elect and vice president-elect and this amazing entire economic team, to address that urgency and seize that opportunity and make our economic system work better for every American. Thank you. Thank you. Good afternoon. I’m hard pressed to find the words to express my gratitude to the president-elect and vice president-elect for the chance to be here today. In thinking about the path that brought me here, a good place to start is 12 years ago almost to the day, when I met with then Vice President-elect Biden at his home not far from here. It was supposed to be a job interview to be his chief economist, but it quickly turned into a conversation about economic justice and fairness, which as many here know is a common destination in conversations with the president-elect. Over the years, we’ve continued that discussion. Often it takes the form of some policy minutiae, sometimes it’s me hitting him with far more graphics than are necessary, or him telling me to stop speaking economese and start speaking English. Guilty as charged Mr. President-elect. I suspect the reason we had such a meeting of the minds back then dates back to a common saying in my household when I was growing up, “If you’re not part of the solution, you’re part of the problem. I grew up with a single mother, a lifelong educator. There was a picture of FDR on the wall. Her proudest moment wasn’t when I got a PhD. It was when I got a union card. Local 802, the New York City’s Musician’s Union. But that’s a whole other story. Of course, if you intend to be part of the solution, you need to accurately diagnose the problem. … me to accurately diagnose the problem. In that regard, I think the president and vice president-elect’s agenda is timely, resonant and visionary. Yes, they’ve stressed the urgent need to control the virus and provide the relief needed to help families and businesses get to the other side of this crisis, but they’ve been just as adamant that simply getting back to where we were sets the bar too low. We must build back an economy that’s far more resilient, far more fair and far more inclusive. It is precisely the vision this nation needs, and I suspect I’m not the only person on this stage chomping at the bit to get to work on making their vision a reality. Thank you. Thanks, Jared. Thanks. Oh. Mr. President-elect and Madam Vice President-elect, I am honored and very grateful for the chance to be a part of this absolutely exceptional team and excited to get to work helping build an economy rooted in the values that we share: equality, opportunity and the dignity of work. It’s no accident that I focused my career on instilling those values in our economy, developing policies that help our nation grow stronger by growing more equitably. Like the president-elect and the vice president-elect, those values were instilled in me at a young age. In the late 1970s, my dad got a job at Boeing, and if you grew up in Seattle like I did, you know what that means. A lot more than a paycheck, as Janet referenced, and as the president so often reminds us. And for our family, my dad’s job at Boeing meant security. It meant union benefits, a place in the neighborhood, a place in the middle-class. But when the recession hit in the early 1980s, one by one the pink slips arrived for every family in our cul-de-sac. Every kid at my bus stop had a parent who was laid off. Our entire community saw its future dimmed, and one by one it was my turn. So the first time I truly experienced this thing called the economy, it was my parents sitting down and explaining that things were going to be tougher for a while because my dad was on layoff. Too many kids in America experience the economy through those kinds of difficult conversations or far worse. I was struck by the profound power this mysterious force held over my life, my friends and my community, and I wondered if that power couldn’t also be wielded to create happier conversations and fuller lives. I’ve dedicated my career to figuring out how we can grow and sustain the middle-class and uproot the gender barriers and racial barriers that leave too many Americans outside the dream looking in. Through the organization I co-founded, I’ve pursued solutions to reverse the dangerous march of inequality and bring us back to the core value of broadly shared success. That’s the same value I see at the heart of the Build Back Better Plan and why I’m so excited and honored to help this team bring not just good jobs, but the good lives and peace of mind that comes with them to every American community. Thank you. Thanks, Heather. Mr. President-elect, congratulations on choosing this outstanding team of brilliant minds, this economic team. This is the right team for this moment, and to our nominees and appointees, thank you for your continued service tarnation. This is the team we need to deliver immediate economic relief to the American people, to get our economy back on track, and to make sure it works for working people. And as President-elect Biden noted earlier, completing that task could not be more urgent. Cases of COVID-19 are spiking, and beyond the tragic loss of life, the toll of this recession continues to mount. Across America, one in six adults with children say their families are hungry. Janet Yellen talked about food insecurity. This is real. We are looking at a hunger crisis in America right now. One in three adults are having trouble paying their bills, essential bills, the bills that be to be paid at the end of every month to get to the next month. And the number of open small businesses has fallen by nearly 30% due to this pandemic, while many others are hoping they can stay afloat until the vaccine is available. These are the struggles, the worries that keep people up in the middle of the night that have them sitting at their kitchen table past midnight trying to figure out how they’re going to make it work. But Americans are not united by their worries alone. They are also united by their aspirations: the aspirations they have for themselves, for their children, for families and for their community. Because no matter where you live or what language your grandmother speaks, everyone wants to be able to get a job and keep a job. No matter what your gender or who you love, everyone wants to be able to buy a home and keep a home. And no matter how you worship or who you voted for in this election, everyone wants to be able to give their children a decent education and allow those children to pursue their dreams, even during a pandemic. And Joe and I understand that; we were raised to respect the dignity of work. We were raised by our hardworking parents who always understood the dignity of work and the potential, not only for their children, but of our country. And that’s why I’ve always fought for working people, standing up for middle-class families who had lost their homes in the Great Recession. Wally, you talked about that. Families in California were devastated, but they were able to rely on their government and the leaders as Joe always talks about who needed to see their condition and speak to that condition. And that’s the work that needs to happen now, and I looked forward to collaborating with this extraordinary team to put working people front and center in our administration. These public servants are some of America’s most brilliant minds. They are proven leaders whose talents, achievements, and life stories, their life stories reflect the stories of the American people and their stories reflect the very best of our country. And they not only have the experience, the expertise and what is necessary to help end this economic crisis, but also what is necessary to put people back to work, and they also share in our commitment to building an economy, an America where everyone has access to a higher minimum wage and affordable healthcare, paid family leave and paid sick, leave home ownership and capital to start a small business. An America, where opportunity is within reach for everyone, for all the people. So we’ve got a lot of work to do to build that America, and as Joe always says, to bill back better, and President-elect Biden and I, together with this economic team, will be ready to hit the ground running on day one, because that is what this crisis demands, and that is what the American people deserve. Thank you. Thanks. Mr. President-elect, will [inaudible 00:09:12]."
"154","12-02-20"," Hi everybody. Good afternoon, sir. Good afternoon. Good afternoon, everybody. Good afternoon. I lead the Biden-Harris transition team’s team on domestic and economic policy. And we’re here to talk today about the economic crisis, which is something that we hear about through statistics on the news, we hear about it in debates in Congress. But it shows up for real in the lives of Americans all around the country, and that’s what we’re here to talk about today. Today we have four individuals as guests, people from around the country who are here to share their stories with President-Elect Joe Biden. So Mr. President-Elect, thank you, and over to you to get us started, sir. Well thank you all, all four of you for being part of this. One of the things about COVID that’s changed is that usually I’d be out in the community, looking you in the eye and trying to figure out what was on your mind, I’d be going to your restaurants, your unions, making sure that I had a clear understanding of what you were facing, because it’s all personal. Every one of you is dealing with something that is very personal and affects all of you differently, although in one sense everybody is affected the same way. I want to thank you for joining me today, and for sharing with me what you and your families are going through, and I know times are both tough, but I believe that with the right policies we can fundamentally change things. And my hope is that we’ll be able to help in a short order. But that depends a lot on our friends in Congress on the other side who are prepared to take the action that has to be taken. My dad [inaudible 00:03:19] Me and my siblings, I was the oldest, I probably the only one that really fully understood it early on, was he said, “Joey, a job’s about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in the community. It’s about being able to look your kids, your family, your friends in the eye and say, ‘I think everything’s going to be okay.'” And he also used to say, “Joey, I don’t expect the government to solve my problems, but I at least expect them to understand my problems, so they understand what it is so I know they have a way of at least they’re working on what I’m concerned about. So that’s what I want to hear from you all today, about the challenges you individually are experiencing. I know you’re all experiencing the effect of one great problem, and that is the economic downturn in large part because of COVID, and the failure of some of our friends in Congress to move forward on the kind of economic package that was passed and needed to help people. But the challenges you’ve experienced affects everybody the same but slightly differently. And I want to hear, to the extent you’re willing to be straightforward with me, and tell me about what your real, deep concerns are, I’d like to hear it. It would help me inform my policy. And I’ve been doing this on a regular basis, meeting with people who are victims of this economic downturn through no fault of their own, have done everything, worked like heck their whole lives, and find themselves in a real dilemma right now. So with that, why don’t I, as my mother used to say, “Hush up, Joey,” and hear from you all. And then maybe I could, as you’re talking, after you finish, maybe ask you some questions. But let’s just have a candid talk, because I got involved in public life way back when I was a kid because of civil rights and because of ordinary working people and middle class people who really built this country. The very wealthy, they’re a lot of good people, but they don’t need my help. But families I came from need my help, and just need a shot, just a chance, just a chance to make it. When they’ve had that chance, they’ve never let the country down. Thank you so much. We’re going to go first to Chicago, to you, Lorie Alexander. You’ve worked as a crossing guard. I understand you never missed a day until this year. Yes, I wanted to say thank you so much for this opportunity, President-Elect, and congratulations on your win. I’ve been working for the city in Chicago for 18 years on and off. The city had so many different issues [inaudible 00:06:18] when I first came into the department. However, COVID took a tremendous strain where I am now unemployed, and I am getting unemployment, and that be difficult during the time of unemployment from the beginning of March. The changes of the dollar amount that they’re getting, you can’t even feed your family, and I just thank god that I don’t have a family right now, my children are grown, they’re adults, and they’re able to [inaudible 00:06:46] for themselves. But unfortunately, as a mom, you want to be able to take care of your children when they call you and say, “Mom, I need something.” I can’t even do that for them. It’s just been such a pleasure to have worked with Local 73, the union, because they have been helping me and guiding me through a lot of the same things that I needed throughout this whole pandemic. I thank god for the organizations in my community and neighborhood, because I’ve been a leader, and also in my community I try to work with seniors, and been working with seniors for years, and I wasn’t even able to help a lot of seniors this year, to be honest with you. That’s just been such a turmoil, but I do thank god I have the opportunity to speak about it for other people who are unable to speak for themselves right now. My job right now, because it’s on a scale where I don’t know if I’m going to get to go back to work, my biggest concern is probably my pension. If I choose to retire, or even if I’m still going to be able to work, and if I do go back to work, would I even be safe? It’s just so many unanswered questions, even just taking, going to get tested and taking the virus, I mean taking the virus if they got it, if it work, and what’s the side effects to the virus if you already have underlying health issues. It’s just so many unanswered questions, and it brings a lot of confusion. I do pray that we can get some type of stimulus package where we, again, can take care of some of our needs and our family, where we can meet some criteria, things that we can take care of far as food and shelter and clothing. I know when I got my stimulus before that health, believe it or not, health is so caught up in dying and bills, it really didn’t do much for me. It went basically to my veterinary bill for my dog and my cat, and I’m not ashamed to say that. But I do pray that you hear our voices, and together, people, we let everybody know what’s going on, and together we can work it out, and hopefully we’ll come up with plenty of solutions thank you. Thank you, Lorie. I’ll come back, ask some questions if I may, but I’ll wait until we get through it all. Thank you. Next we’re going to Detroit to Karen Coffey. You work at Comerica Stadium. That’s my hometown. Thank you for being here. Yes, thank you so much for having me, and thank you so much for the platform. Hello, President-Elect Joe Biden. Thank you for your time. I really appreciate it, for you sitting down and listening to our concerns today. Because we do have a lot of concerns, Mr. Biden. It’s been rough. I mean, my last day of work was March the 8th when everything shut down. I’ve been an employee at LCA Joe Louis, Joe Louis’s, LCA is the new Joe Louis Arena, and Comerica Park for 30 years. I’ve been with my union, Unite Here, they’ve helped us tremendously through this by giving us all type of information and staying by us. The unemployment helps so much, when we had the extra money. But once the extra money left, it’s downhill from there. It’s hard trying to keep up with your bills, trying to pay … Not only me, all of us. This is all servers, all of these stadium workers, and the hospitality workers. We are really suffering. And it hurts us when we hear people that don’t have any issues, politicians that are doing just fine, when they say, “Oh, they don’t need that extra money, they’re just lazy. They need to get a job.” There is nowhere to go to get a job. But we would be working. We don’t want to be sitting here, home, on unemployment. We want to be working. We want to be able to go back to our old jobs that we had, that we want to make sure that they’re safe for all the employees to come back. We want to make sure that the companies cannot go out and hire new employees once we are able to go back to work. We were right in the middle of contracts. And we’re just hoping that they don’t try and take our jobs away from us, that we’ve been there for so many years, and we’ve been so dedicated to them. Our health insurance. Now we don’t have health insurance. We paid for, a lot of us pay for our own health insurance because the companies don’t pay for that. But now we can’t even afford to pay our health insurance because we’re not getting the money. I don’t even know what to say. We feel hopeless. That’s how we feel. We feel like there’s … Like we don’t know what tomorrow is going to bring, where there is any help going to come from. And it’s just an everyday struggle for us. So we’re hoping that we can get some help. Our health insurance is gone, our jobs are basically gone, and we need job security. We need the companies to know that they can’t give our jobs to somebody else once this is over, that we can come back. We want to be there. We want to pick right back up our lives and move on. I mean, my mother is here with me. It’s just been mentally straining, and draining, to have to worry about … She’s elderly. So I worry about her. Then I have to worry about my own self trying to stay healthy without insurance so I can take care of my mother. It’s bad. And we need help. We need help with unemployment, we need help with our health insurance, and we need to know that our jobs will be there once it is safe for us to go back. And I thank you for this time, and this platform, for you listening to our concerns, and hopefully we can come to some type of help, something, that can get us through this. And I thank you. Well, I fear that. I really do. I fear that from the company that I work for. I mean, our union is trying to stand behind us and trying to make sure that we’re okay here. But we don’t know. We have not heard one thing from then since they closed down, since we shut down. Not one reach out, not one email. Nothing to say, “We will welcome you back.” So we don’t know. We really don’t know. None of us. Well, you ought to talk to your union. No, I am part of the union. Our company will not reach back out to us. Well my … Okay. It’s ghosts. They’re ghosts. Well, I think it’s going to be hard for them to not hire back the existing workforce if they’re able to hire people back. But that’s a different, I’ll look into that. But I have other questions later. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much, Karen. Thank you. So we’re going to Milwaukee next. Dan Jacobs, you’re a small business owner. You own restaurants. And this is out of, the crisis has had an effect on you, on the people who work for you. Absolutely. Thank you, President-Elect Biden, and your staff for taking the time today to talk to American workers and me, the lone small business owner. Successful small business owners have one thing in common, and that’s our willingness to do whatever it takes. This keeps us not very far removed from the other people on this call. But let me share with you what I’m going through right now. My name is Dan Jacobs, and I am a member of the IRC, which is the Independent Restaurant Coalition, HUA, Hospitality United Associations, and a cofounder of MIRC, Milwaukee’s Independent Restaurant Coalition. These organizations did not exist pre-COVID, but they came together in response to the pandemic to help navigate and find the best possible solutions to keeping our vibrant restaurant and bar communities together, and to help find a solution to the economic fallout of COVID-19. My partner, Dan Van Wright and I, we own and operate the JVR Hospitality Group here in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. … Johnson. On March 1st, our group consisted of 90 plus employees with 80% of them being full time. Three restaurants, a bakery, a restaurant consulting out of our organization, and a Dandan kiosk in the Fiserv Forum where the Milwaukee Bucks play. Today, due to COVID, we’ve had to reduce our staff to 26 employees with only 12 of them being full-time. We’re left with two restaurants, Dandan and EsterEv, having been forced to permanently closed the bakery, Batches, and our French restaurant Fauntleroy because of a 91% revenue loss. Since June 1st, here at Dandan and EsterEv, we lost another $700,000 worth of revenue. Unfortunately, this story isn’t unique, not among the 500,000 plus independent restaurants or the countless small businesses across the country. I worry about our future as a company, but I’m mostly worried about the future of our team, as well as the workers of our industry and small businesses nationwide, who are furloughed right now and whose UI benefits are set to run out or already have. Our business initially missed out on the first round of PPP. But in the end, we did receive a PPP and an EIDL loan in May and in June. While these two programs helped, they just act as a bandaid to slow losses and furloughs. These programs are not answers to our deepening small business economic problems. For restaurants specifically, the PPP program falls far short. Only 8% of the businesses that receive PPP loans were restaurants. However, our industry was the hardest hit, mainly because restaurant’s first or second largest expenses are food and beverage costs. These are not eligible as grant expenses. Our company personally exhausted our PPP loan in October. Patios? It’s winter here in Milwaukee, which I’m sure you know about Scranton winters. Pretty much the same. Add that to the exploding COVID positivity rate, that’s come to form a perfect storm of loss of revenue for businesses. Then on top of that, the loss of jobs from the American workforce that were propped up by those PPP loans. As winter approached, we spent $20,000 to make our restaurant as safe as possible for our team and for our guests. But that money just seems like a waste now as it’s just not safe to be indoors with people that aren’t in your bubble. We are worse off right now than we were in March. At least in March, there was hope and there was a feeling that we were all in this together. Now we look toward a long winter that’s here, knocking on the door, with a feeling of true desperation. Last month alone, my company lost $23,000. At this rate, we will make our obligations having to continue to get real scrappy, real inventive through March or April. But after that, our continued operation is not guaranteed or even possible without some help. This is the big one. Mr. President-Elect, if there’s one point that I hope that you take away from today, it’s that we as small business owners, like our workforce, can not have that help come in the form of taking on more debt. We need grant help and we need that grant help now. Luckily there’re programs out there like the Restaurant Act, which has bipartisan support in the Senate, including co-sponsored by your Vice President-Elect, Kamala Harris and has passed the House of Representatives. The Restaurant Act would immediately help independent restaurants across the country. Independent restaurants account for 11 plus million workers, plus another 6 million workers just outside our bubble. Think about bakers, fishermen, farmers, forgers. These are the people that work outside of us. Restaurant and bars are a lot of the time people’s first and last jobs in our workforce. So many people have passed through our industry, including former presidents like Abraham Lincoln, who was a bartender in Illinois. I love that story. I want the opportunity to bring my bartenders back and give them the tools to be their best selves because who knows, the next one could be the next Joe Biden. In Wisconsin, the Restaurant Act would be absolutely huge. We understand the necessity to shut down now and stay safe right now for us to get through this winter with very minimum loss of life. But the post vaccine world is where our economy needs us most. The Restaurant Act would allow us to bridge to a post vaccine world where we could get our staff back to work, to galvanize Wisconsin tourism industry, encouraging travelers to eat in Wisconsin’s establishments, visit our tourist attractions, go to our retail shops, and take in a show at maybe one of our local independent concert event venues, which selfishly I miss the most. The Restaurant Act would allow independent restaurants to continue to be the gateway to cultures and neighborhoods throughout our country. It will allow us to be the great engine of our economy. 90 cents of every dollar that comes into a restaurant goes right back out the door. It’s fueling economic ecosystem of bankers, farmers, butchers, foragers, all the way to electricians and carpenters, to that Cisco truck driver transporting food across the country, and then all of the things he or she touches along the way. Finally, Mr. President-Elect, small business owners are some of the most creative people out here. We have to constantly pivot and re-pivot, adapting to an ever-changing disease that we didn’t bring on. As an industry, restaurant and bars have never asked for a handout. We are always the companies that charity organizations come to for donations first. Whether it’s feeding the hungry or just donating our time and energy to causes diverse and best, we answer that call because it’s simply the right thing to do. For most of us, all we know is hospitality. Hospitality is defined as the friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, and strangers. We do this because we love taking care of people. All I’m asking is that you give us the tools to succeed, to get back to what we do best, which is hospitality. We just want to reach to the crazy end of this chapter of American history together. I think you said something, give me the ability to tell our staffs that everything is going to be okay, just like somebody gave you or your father the ability to say that. I want to be able to do that for my staff. Thanks again for your time and for hearing me today. Thank you, Dan. Thank you so much. We’re going to go to Georgia now and hear from Jessica Gavin. You and your mom both work as a stagehand and a rigger. Yes. Thank you so much President-elect Biden. I appreciate you and your staff for giving me the time to actually speak on behalf of workers and entertainment workers within the union. I’m actually a member of IATSE Local 834 here in Atlanta, Georgia. We do trade shows. We were the first to be let off and we’ll probably be the last to go back. Our entire workforce is pretty much unemployed and we’ve been unemployed since March. The federal extension from the CARES Act, it kind of helped us out from March until now. I’m sorry. It’s very emotional. It’s very hard and it’s very bad what’s happening here. A lot of people are going hungry. A lot of people can’t afford to pay their bills. I don’t know how to explain it, but it’s something that we never wished we would see in this lifetime. Unemployment, it helps, but without the $600 we’re forced or we were left to live off of $365 a week. Some people don’t qualify for unemployment and even if you do qualify for unemployment, some extension programs, they usually would take a minimum of three weeks before we would qualify. Now you have anywhere from eight to nine weeks before you can receive any type of compensation. That unemployment check is not guaranteed to go to food. A lot of those are for utility bills and car notes and mortgages and rents. So when you go down the street and you see a food pantry line wrapped around the corner because people are starving and some people are getting out of line because they would rather mother with children and elderly people to go before them. So you have hungry people who would move to the back of the line just to allow others to go before them and they’re still hungry. It’s hard. That’s just being able to survive. You still have people who don’t have health insurance. In September, 30% of our labor force was removed from the health insurance. By 2021, February, 100% of my local union will not have health insurance. Entertainment workers right now are being put on the back burner. A lot of small businesses and a lot of other workforces are going back, slowly but surely, with COVID relief and aid programs, but entertainment workers are still left behind. My concern would be for unemployment, for job security, as far as going back to work and health insurance and just any type of relief package for actual entertainment workers. We’re basically just on a limb here. We’ve tried everything, we’re doing as much as we can. We’re trying to get out. I’m here in Georgia, so of course we’re trying to get out and make sure we get people to vote for this Senate race because it’s very important, but we need help. We need a lot of help. We need a lot of help. So my concern is, President-elect Biden, what will you do to aid workers who have been without since the beginning of February? Some in January. What can you do or what will you do to help us? We need help. Not all government assistance programs will relieve us from the burdens that we have of not being able to provide for our families. If you have union families like mine, my mother, my stepfather, my brother, as well as myself, we are all union members. It’s not like we can call another family member or call someone else to aid us when the entire family is off work. My concern is the relief for working people during this time. Thank you. … before the President-elect responds, I know your family has been hit hard by the COVID epidemic itself. Mm-hmm (affirmative). Yes. Like I said before, it has been very, very hard. I am so thankful for my union, because if it wasn’t for being able to pull from pensions, our annuity or IRA, we would be left without. Like I said before, I can’t call my mother to ask her to assist in taking care of my home because she’s going through the same situation. So at this time we are all in a slump. We are all just waiting and we’re on a hope and a prayer that something will change because now we’re going into a full year with no work, no income. Majority of us have no health insurance. That’s no way to pay bills. That’s no way to really put food on the table to take care of your family. Usually around this time, everyone would be getting excited for Christmas. We would always be grabbing gifts and wrapping gifts and sitting around. But due to COVID, you can’t even sit around in your family and we can’t afford to purchase gifts. Nope. To be honest, you look around, you can’t even celebrate with some family members because we have lost them due to COVID. COVID has really changed everyone’s world. I can’t call my aunt and ask her what she wants for Christmas, because COVID has taken her life, as well as other family members and union members and friends. I hope this vaccine actually do help. I hope that we can get back to work and I pray that our government actually put in protocols and procedures for working people with COVID around. Because the worst thing about COVID, even if we do go back to work and someone catches it, or someone in the crew catches it, now we all have to quarantine. Now we’re out of work again for 14 days. There’s no relief or aid for working people when they’re sent home and quarantine due to COVID. Now maybe I have to stay in a hotel or maybe my family has to go somewhere else. All of this stuff costs money, all of this costs money, everything costs money. Then not only that, we don’t have health insurance, a lot of us, and if you do have health insurance, how long will you have it? There’s a lot of questions and concerns behind COVID, especially for working people. Again, my biggest concern is a relief for working people. You’re going to take care of us while we’re not working, but when we go back to work, will we still have relief? Because you have a lot of billion dollar corporate corporations that are not concerned about the health of working people. Some of us wish we would never see these days, but we are seeing them. We have to do something. President-elect, I’m so sorry that you had to come in during this time. I really wish you could just have one year election within a good time, but we trust you, the American people trust you, unions trust you, working people’s trust you, and Vice President Harris, I hope all of this could just work out in our favor. But we trust you and hopefully we can all come to some type of conclusion. Well, let me start by saying, I’m going to be completely blunt with you and frank, about what’s available, what’s not, what should be and what shouldn’t be. To state the obvious, my ability to get you help immediately does not exist. I’m not even in office for another 50 days and then I have to get legislation passed through the United States Congress to get things done. But I can lay out what I want to do. Let me tell you what I think should be done in the meantime. Remain there until January 21st, when I would take office, after being sworn in on January 20th. There’s been an attempt to be able to provide for help, in the meantime. One of my greatest concerns has been the failure to deal with COVID to begin with. Had we taken the action we should have taken back in late January, February, March, and April, to deal with the disease, the disease which the president said would go away, “It will go away by Easter. When the hot weather comes, it may be gone. Don’t worry about it. It’s going to be like a miracle, it’s going to go away.” None of that was true to begin with. And it was all designed, in my view, to make sure that it didn’t spook the stock market, which doesn’t affect a lot of you unless you have a 401k and even then it doesn’t affect you that much. And so we didn’t do the things that had to be done in order to be able to protect people’s lives, and to dampen down, flatten out this curve, and begin to make real progress on getting rid of the disease. At the bottom rung, that still is a single most consequential thing that has to be done. We could provide all the aid in the world, and your restaurants aren’t going to be good and open unless people decide they’re all going to show up anyway and get COVID, if they’re in close proximity to one another. And the States are not going to be able to fund the school crossing guards, which are essential workers, and the teachers, and the first responders, the cops, the firefighters, the EMTs, et cetera, because the cities have to balance their budgets, and the good smart thing about our founders, although it was over 200 years ago, that’s why they allowed the federal government to deficit spend. That is, in moments of crisis, to be able to spend money on the [inaudible 00:02:09], so that in fact, we could get the economy moving again, which has happened in every great recession that we’ve had. But what happened is that we’re now in a situation where the Congress and these CARES Acts that they passed, they passed a couple of trillion dollars worth of help. And one of the big problems was that help went to a lot of people who didn’t need the help; the PPP, and the PPE, the equipment went to places that were doing pretty well. They didn’t go to the people who badly needed it early on. Some of it did, but not nearly what it should have. And I think your experience Dan, was that first time you went for the PPP loan, you went to a major bank and they decided they weren’t going to fund it. If I’m not mistaken. That’s right sir. That’s correct. Well, you may remember because you seem to be attuned with what’s going on in the news, I argued that that was going to happen because the big banks, even though they weren’t liable for any of this money, they were getting it, we bailed them out in the past, you know? They’re being held harmless. It was too much trouble to take the time to lend it. They’d ask you, “Do you have a credit card with us? Do you have an account with us? Have you borrowed with us before? Or do you have a system?” And by the time you get answers to all that, the answer is basically, “No, we’re not going to lend to you,” and you’re in trouble. You’re already behind the eight ball. And so first point of this is that I think that the Congress they’re trying like the devil, there was a bipartisan effort it’s been happening now, time and again, a bipartisan effort that came forward about three, four or five days ago, that called for instead of the $1.6 trillion at the House thought, I think is 1.6, Cecilia, I can’t remember the exact number, in the new bill that they passed. “New,” back in May they passed it. And they finally decided, they negotiated something for about 900 billion. Wouldn’t be the answer, but it’d bring immediate help for a lot of things quickly. But what happened was the president said he wouldn’t support it, and apparently Republicans in the Congress, the Senate said they wouldn’t support it. So it’s now back to square one again. And what our friends seem to be focusing most on is liability. Guaranteed, there’s no liability for businesses if in fact they open, anything happens. And anyway, it’s a long story, but here’s the deal; one of the things that we think should happen and continue is that no-one should be evicted from their apartment or their home for being able to fail, to be able to pay their rent and/or their mortgage until this crisis is over. And it should be funded, that should be held up. Now, you can’t deny the apartment owner, he or she’s not have just pockets that are so deep they can afford to pay everything and not have anything, so it was supposed to be paid for. Paid for, not a loan, to be paid for in a crisis. This is a national crisis. This is a national crisis that we’re facing, and it affects the entire economy. So the first thing is rent, and you just your housing, your basic housing, are you able to maintain without being worried you’re going to be getting notice you’re thrown out in the street. Number two, and if you’re fortunate enough to own your home, that’s a different thing or own your condominium, that’s a different thing. Second thing is that there was a proposal we put forward that suggested that already over 10 million people have lost their health insurance because their businesses went out of business. So the business can’t pay anybody, the business is out of business. So it’s basically bankrupt. So they’re not able to participate in paying for that. And so that’s a lot of wonky language, but there was a proposal to said that we would, in fact, the federal government, pay the share that the business used to pay for the employee, so they could keep that health insurance policy they had, and until things got better. Thirdly, we find that the president is still in court, trying to strip away all of healthcare from the Affordable Care Act, just flat, eliminate it, all get rid of it all. It’s deadly wrong. I think not only should we keep it, we should be adding to it, providing for a public option, a Medicare option if you chose that, if you can’t afford to buy in, then you’re in a situation where you get Medicare, Medicaid, if you’re eligible for Medicaid and your state doesn’t provide it, you get it for free, period. And so there’s two ways to deal with healthcare. One is to supplement the businesses that are going out of business, or can’t afford to keep their health insurance for their employees. And secondly, to make sure we make it a lot easier to buy into the Affordable Healthcare Act and get more coverage with a lot cheaper, with drug prices coming down substantially, as well as making sure that there’s a Medicaid option, a Medicare option in the healthcare plan. That’s what I ran on. That’s the one of the reasons I think I got the nomination. And so that’s going to be one of my first efforts as well when I get elected, it’s not going to happen between now and then. Third thing that it seems to me, is the unemployment with their $600 kick in is really important. It’s the thing that allows people to stay above water, give some sense of security. It’s not like there’s a lot of jobs you’re going to go do. Like, “Oh you’re sitting home being lazy.” Well, where the heck are you going to go get a job? Every one of you, if there are another job out there that could pay you something, be out applying for it. But it just makes no sense. But it’s some of our very conservative friends think that, the same people who think you should have to, if you need what used to be called, “Food stamps,” you should have to work to be able to do [inaudible 00:41:14], I mean, come on, we’re way beyond that. And so there’s a number of things that could be done. And in terms of being able to open your restaurants, first of all, my deceased wife’s father was a restaurateur. After World War II he came home and became a very successful restaurateur. And I watched how hard he worked, and that made me realize I never want to be in the restaurant business. You think I’m joking? You guys, men and women have to love it. It is a God awful thing. Especially if you have a 24 hour diner like my father-in-law had. Plus making sure that all those folks who had the contracts to serve the universities and their food system, what’s happening to them now? They’re all in trouble as well. There’s nothing there, because these universities are shutting down, and they’re all going virtual. So we’ve got to provide for you the ability to open, and open safely, and there’s ways to do that, and it should not be a loan; it should be a guarantee. You should be in a position where you can have all that ventilation changed, all the dividers put up, all the social distancing that you need, and make sure that your staff is safe as well, both indoors and out. But it costs a lot of money to do that, and you should be able to get that money to be able to stay open, because it affects the ability of the economy to continue to grow. What people don’t realize is putting this money into the economy generates economic growth. It’s not just you have a debt; you do, but it generates so much growth when you’re a restaurant employees able to go out and buy a used car, you go out and make sure they can get their first apartment, make sure they can go out and purchase new clothing. It all relates to everybody else does better. So that’s why, for example, with my proposal, I know my Republican friends say everybody’s a big spending Democrat, well, the point is that even the Wall Street types, like [Moody’s 00:43:38] point out that my proposal would create 18.6 million new jobs, good paying jobs and would increase the economy by a trillion dollar economic growth. So what’s though, and the big thing for [Laurie 00:00:43:56], and state workers is, one of the most important things we have to do is we have to deal with giving state and local governments assistance. You may remember, all but one of you are old enough to remember when we had the Great Recession in 2008, that we had Barack and I inherited from the last administration. It was the most significant recession in the history of the United States, short of a depression. And what happened was, we went out and the president of put me in charge of spending, we were able to convince three Republicans to change their votes, and we passed the bill, it turned out to be $84 billion that had to be spent in 18 months to keep the economy from crashing. It kept us from out of the depression. And by the way, even the conservative think tanks pointed out of less than 2/10th of 1% waste or fraud. I handle that on a daily basis every single day. I talked over 165 mayors I talked to every governor but one, on a constant basis about how they could spend the money. And what happened was it generated economic growth. People came back. Well, that was federal money, and I’ll be out of that federal money, 147 billion, I was able to give to the States and the cities, who showed they had a need, because they are laying off permanently their teachers, their firefighters, their law enforcement officers, their first responders, shutting down local mental health clinics, shutting down small hospitals, and that all relates to people’s health, safety, and wellbeing. And I guess the point is, the full Congress should come together and pass a robust package of relief to address your urgent needs now. That means extending unemployment insurance for Laurie, and Jessica and Karen, and the millions of Americans like them who’ve lost their jobs, or ours, through no fault of their own. And that’s going to help you put food on the table, and pay the bills. You’re going to make sure businesses like yours, Dan have the resources they need in addition to the guidance and health and safety standards to open safely. Open safely. And that will help businesses stay open, hire workers, like all of you. Thirdly, we have to provide States and cities, the funding. So workers like Laurie can go back to work as her job as school crossing guard, keeping children safe. And we have to make sure, fourthly, people came evicted from their homes because they can’t pay their rent or their mortgage payment during the pandemic. This isn’t a political game. This impacts on people’s real lives, and families. It impacts on all of you, all of us, and we need to get help out the door as soon as we can. And Americans like you need relief now. So I’ve been urging our congressional Republicans to work on a bipartisan emergency package now, but any package passed in this so-called, “Lame duck” [inaudible 00:47:15] be now in January 21st, at best is only going to be a down payment on what’s going to happen early next year. My transition team is already working on what I will put forward the next Congress to address the multiple crises we’re facing, especially the economic crisis and COVID. Come January, the vice-president elect and I are going to fight every day for your families. That’s my commitment. And quite frankly, abuse against women and children in households. And so there’s an awful lot of people, including our doctors and nurses, who need additional mental assistance. The doctors and nurses talking to me are telling me how many of them, when they’re in an operating room, or they’re critical care nurses, how many times can they hold the hand of person who’s dying, and hold they’re hand, and know that that woman or man can’t even talk to, can’t see, they may hold up a phone, their son, their daughter, their husband, their wife, their child. I mean, it’s one of those things that is profoundly destabilizing. And so there’s a lot we have to do to keep these people, keep them up. Now the only good… not the only one of them, good news pieces here is, and it really is, is that, as you probably have been reading, I, early on, put together a COVID taskforce of the most significant scientists in the area. I think there are… how many we have on it now? 23 members, something like that. 23, yes sir. And these are the leading doctors in the world, happen to be in the United States. And there’s two things that are happening for real. One, help is on the way in terms of vaccines. But the vaccine is not the most important thing, it’s the vaccination. It’s one thing to pay, and the government have people show up and get the vaccine that’s been delivered to the state capital or to hospitals, wherever it’s going to be delivered, another thing to get that vaccine from the vaccine, and I don’t want to scare anybody, but into the arm, to get a vaccination. That’s a really expensive proposition. We’re talking about having to make sure over 340 million Americans, and others I might add, have to access to that vaccination. And so that’s going to rapidly, God willing, once we have it, be able to get out, and be able to change the way in which we no longer have to shut down like we did. And what’s happening is, and I hope you all are listening with all the trouble you’re going through. You cannot be traveling during these holidays, as much as you want to. I have a large family, you probably… Barack used to kid me about it. I mean, everything for me is family, beginning, middle, and end. When one comes, everybody comes. You think I’m joking, I’m not. We would have 16 people go away every Thanksgiving. And my deceased son, before he passed away, we’d all go away and we’d go away on Thanksgiving to be just a nuclear family, mom, dad, sons, daughters, husbands, wives, grandchildren, and we, the first time, we had a Thanksgiving with my wife and myself, my daughter in the region and her husband, who’s a doctor, in the region. That’s it. Well Christmas is going to be a lot harder. And I don’t want to scare anybody here, but understand the facts. We’re likely to lose another 250,000 people dead between now and January. You hear me? Because people aren’t paying attention. People aren’t paying attention. You are Dan, you’re not letting people congregate inside your restaurant. You know what that would mean. But there’s ways we have to bring down the virus, we have to bring down the replication rate of it, how many… Anyway, and we have to significantly increase testing. And there’s a lot of things we can do by the spring to be able to get everybody back in the swing of things, and people being able to safely open, and safely be with one another. But look, I know I’m… Trump always made fun of me, I’m always wearing this mask. But let me tell you something, it matters. It’s not about saving my life, it’s about saving your life. When I have this mask on I have the heavy one underneath it. When I have this mask on, it’s less about me being safe, it’s about me making sure that you are safe. It’s a patriotic thing to do, it really is. I hear all this about, ” Well, it’s a great sacrifice of my freedom.” Well tell that to all the people who went to WWI and gave their lives, and WWII, and the Korean War, and tell… I mean, come on. You’re helping other people. It’s not you. It’s other people. Other people. And so I think we have to change the mindset here a little bit. It’s got to be about giving. About giving. You know that old expression from the Bible, ” What you do to the least of brethren you do unto me.” Well that’s what this is about. I’m not trying to proselytize and convert anybody to anything, but this is basic human decency. Just decency. So look, I promise you, the things that I’m going to be working on very, very hard are first and foremost getting the billions of dollars that are needed to get COVID under control, get the vaccine distributed, get it out quickly, and get it to the most urgent people, most urgently needed, and that happens to be people who are in nursing homes, because there’s significantly high proportion of those are in the mortality side of things. And the number of people who have died in nursing homes exceeds about anything else. And I have to get it to those doctors and nurses, who by the way, are losing their lives. Their lives. A lot of them, not a joke. It’s about those first responders, driving those ambulances, making sure that they’re showing up. It’s about that fireman going into a burning vehicle and pulling somebody out and not asking, “Do you have COVID or don’t you have COVID?” I mean, we have to get that. And then to get to the school teachers and small businesses to be able to open, because small business is the economic engine of the country, and restaurants are a major part of that small business, a major part of that small businesses. So I just think that Karen, I know this has a lot of emotional strain on you and everybody else. Yes. Yes. But imagine what it’s like if you weren’t even a member of a union. I know, that’s why I love my union. I know. No, I know that, but my point is, that’s the last point I want to make. America is built by the working folks and middle class. And unions built the middle class, and look at all the people who aren’t represented, so don’t have any possibility, talk about a pension, what pension? I remember my dad coming home and saying, “Well, started this pension, the company, he just decided to stop it. Boom, done, over.” Or, remember him rolling around in the bed at night and asking my mom what was the matter. And she said, “Dad’s upset because we lost our health insurance. This is stuff that has a profound impact on people’s minds, on their sense of themselves. And so, but here’s the… I don’t want you giving up hope. I really don’t want you giving up hope. I promise you, hang on, we’re going to get through this. You’re going to get through this. It’s going to be hard as hell for the next 50 to 70 days unless the House acts in some way, the Senate acts and passes some of this material. And Dan, I think we got to go back and look at all the businesses that have gone out of business, and look at all, particularly, [Menardi 00:56:44] businesses. I know you have something like four out of six black business going out of business. Whether it’s the local grocery store or it’s the beauty salon, or whatever. It’s the center of communities. Most of you are from fairly large cities. Well there’s a lot of rural areas that are really getting crushed. They don’t have anything going for them. We can fix it. And I think when we fix it we got to go back and try to make up for what we didn’t do for you all, what we didn’t do, so people aren’t left with staggering amounts of debt, staggering amounts of… As they go through. So anyway, as my… Every time I walk out of my grandpa’s house up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, he was a good guy, and he’d yell, “Joey, keep the faith.” And my grandmother would yell, “No Joey, spread the faith.” You’ve got to spread the faith a little bit. Mm-hmm (affirmative). I like that. No, I really mean it. I promise you, I promise you, watch. I always try to do what I say I’m going to do, and if I make a mistake I’ll tell you I made a mistake and I’ll take responsibility. It’s the responsibility of the president of the United States to set the agenda as to how we deal with this crisis. It’s the responsibility… guidepost for how people can move forward. Instead of leaving it to every… And the mayors and governors are working like hell, Democrat and Republican. They’re working like hell. But, but, they need more guidance and more help. And that’s what my job is as the Commander in Chief. I view this as sort of a standing army we got to put together to deal with this. But we all know, you’ve all been through not just this crisis, many of you have been through difficult times in your life in other ways. We all have dealt with pain. But it’s kind of a… The human condition is that… I believe why we’re going to do okay is, it’s always a bad bet to bet against the United States. The United States is all about possibilities. There’s never anything we’ve tried to do together we haven’t been able to get done. We’ll get this done. My fear and concern is, how many people may get left by the wayside in the meantime. And that’s the job we have to step up now to do whatever we can now. And by the way, look at all that’s going on. Look at what’s happening in major cities in America, where you see where there’s prosperity, you see miles and miles and miles and miles of automobiles lined up to get food. The food shortage in the United States, lack of access, is overwhelming. Like you said Jessica, people in line, and stepping… Or maybe it was you Karen, standing in line and backing up to let somebody else move. The American people are showing their grit, and it’s about time the government show it. Thank you. Absolutely. Yep. Yep. All right? All right. Thank you so much Mr. President. Thank you. I’d like to thank you. Thank you. Karen, Jessica, Laurie, Dan, thank you for letting us in your home. Stay strong, stay strong. Thank you. Thank you. Thanksgiving was the opportunity. Opportunity. Thank you. Thank you very much for listening. Thank you. Okay. You’re welcome. All right, bye, bye. Bye bye. Thank you all now. Bye now."
"155","12-04-20"," Good afternoon, folks. Thanks for being here. Earlier today, the November jobs report was released and it was grim. It shows an economy that’s stalling and we remain in the midst of one of the worst economic and job crises in modern history. But it doesn’t have to stay that way. If we act now. Now, I mean now, we can begin to regain momentum and start to build back a better future. There’s no time to lose. Millions of people have lost their jobs or had their hours slashed. They’ve lost their health insurance or are in danger of losing their health insurance. One in every six renters is behind in rent. One in four small businesses can’t keep their doors open. And there’s a growing gap in Black and Latino unemployment and the gap remains much too large. And it’s deeply troubling that last month’s drop in overall unemployment was driven by people who were dropping out of the job market, not because more people were being hired. Dropping out of the job market altogether. They’ve lost hope of finding a job or they’ve taken full-time caregiving responsibilities as child centers remain closed and their children learn remotely. Over the past three months, 2. 3 million more people are long-term unemployed, meaning for 23 weeks or more. By far the largest increase on record. This is a dire jobs report. It’s a snapshot, I might remind you, up to mid-November. Before the surge in COVID cases many predicted and the deaths rise that we’ve seen in December, as we head into a very dark winter ahead. For example, since October, cities are down 21,000 educators, just as schools need more help in fighting against the pandemic. A couple of days ago, I spoke with a school crossing guard, a server, a restaurant owner and a stagehand. Good people. Honorable people. Decent, hard-working Americans from across the country. … across the country. It reminded me of my dad who lost his job in Scranton and eventually moved our family to Delaware, just outside of Wilmington, a place called Claymont. He used to say, you’ve heard me say it before, “Joey, I don’t expect the government to solve my problems, but I expect them at least to understand my problems.” The folks I’m talking about, the folks out there aren’t looking for a handout. They just need help. They are in trouble through no fault of their own. Nothing they did caused them to have hours cut or lose their job or drop out of the market. What they need, they need us to understand. We’re in a crisis. We need to come together as a nation. We need the Congress to act and act now. If Congress and President Trump fail to act by the end of December, 12 million Americans will lose their unemployment benefits they rely on. Merry Christmas. The unemployment they rely on to keep food on the table, keep the lights on and the heat on, pay their bills. Emergency paid leave will end. Moratorium on evictions will expire. States will lose the vital tools they need to pay for COVID testing and public health. Put yourselves in that position, anybody listening, laying awake at night, wondering what’s going to happen tomorrow. It’s going to be harder for states to keep children and educators safe in schools, to try to provide assistance to keep small businesses alive. States and cities are already facing large, large budget shortfalls this year. Again, through no fault of their own. They’ve already laid off more than a million workers. Even more teachers, firefighters, cops will lose their jobs unless federal government steps shut up now. All of this weakens our ability to control the virus if we don’t step up now. Emergency paid leave reduces the spread of COVID because it allows people to stay home when they’re sick. States and cities need funding to direct their COVID response, which is the only way we’re going to end the economic crisis as well, the only way we’re going to get people back to work. I’m not alone in saying this situation is urgent. If we don’t act now, the future will be very bleak. Americans need help and they need it now. And they need more to come early next year. But I must tell you, I am encouraged by the bipartisan efforts in the Senate around $900 billion package for relief. It’s a bipartisan effort. When Congress, as they work out the details of this relief package, they’re going to have to focus on resources for direct public health responses to COVID-19. We need meaningful funding for vaccines now. So don’t lose time and leave people waiting for additional months. We need serious funding for testing now. We need to ramp up testing to allow our schools and business to operate safely. The sooner we pass the funding, the sooner we can turn the corner on COVID-19. In the week since this election ended, there were questions about whether Democrats and Republicans could work together. I know many of you are skeptical about my view that they will and can. Right now, they are showing they can. Congress and President Trump have to get this deal done for the American people. But any package passed in the lame duck session is not going to be enough overall. It’s critical, but it’s just a start. Congress are going to need to act again in January. Earlier today, I consulted a number of my economic team, most of which have been announced by now, and Vice President Harris and I announced that team last week. As we inherit the public health and economic crisis, we’re working on a plan that we’ll put forward for the next Congress to move fast to control the pandemic, to revive the economy, and to build back better than before. We hope to see the same kind of spirit of bipartisanship and cooperation as we’re seeing today. Our plan is based on the input from a broad range of people the Vice President Elect and I have been meeting with since winning this election last month, labor leaders, the leading CEOs in the country, mayors and governors of both parties, parents, educators, workers, small business owners. There’s a consensus that as we battle COVID-19, we have to make sure the businesses and workers had the tools, the resources, and the guidance and the health and safety standards to keep businesses and schools open safely. It can be done. Because here’s the deal, the fight against COVID won’t be won in January alone. To truly end this crisis, Congress is going to need to fund more testing as well as a more equitable and free distribution of the vaccine. We need more economic relief to bridge through 2021 until this pandemic and economic crisis are over. And then we need to build back better. I’ve said it before. An independent analysis by Moody’s, a well-respected Wall Street firm, projects that my bill bag better plan would create 18.6 million good paying jobs. It’s based on a simple premise. Reward work in America, not wealth. We’re going to invest in infrastructure, clean energy and manufacturing, and so much more. We’ll create millions of good paying American jobs and get the job market back in the path to full employment. This will raise income, reduce drug prices, advance racial equity across the economy, and restore the backbone of this country, the middle-class. Look, the bottom line, it’s essential. We provide immediate relief for working families and businesses now, not just help them get to the other side of this painful crisis, but avoid a much broader economic cost due to long-term unemployment and businesses failing. By acting now, even with deficit financing, we can add to growth in the near future. In fact, economic research shows that with conditions like the crisis today, especially with such low interest rates, not taking action, the action I’m proposing, will hurt the economy, scar the workforce, reduce growth and add to the national debt. Look, I know times are tough. The challenges are daunting. But I know we can do this. We can create an economic recovery for all, for everybody. We can move from crisis to recovery and to resurgence. For Lord’s sake, this is the United States of America. We’ve done it before and we’ll do it again. We will. I promise you. So I thank the bipartisan group that is trying to put something together right now. We’re going to need more bipartisanship as we move on. God bless you guys and the women are doing this. God bless our country. And may God protect our troops. I’ll stop there and I’d be happy to take some questions. Mr. President Elect, one of the biggest tasks that you will have when you enter office is distributing a vaccine. Your team has started to meet with the Trump Administration to learn of their plans as you are set to inherit this task. Well, there’s a lot more that has to be done. They’ve clued us into their planning on how they plan to distribute the actual vaccine to the various states. But there is no detailed plan, that we’ve seen anyway, as to how you get the vaccine out of a container into an injection syringe into somebody’s arm. And it’s going to be very difficult for that to be done and it’s a very expensive proposition. For example, we agree with their priorities that they’ve laid out so far. I do, at least. My team is looking at it, of dealing with first responders and those in nursing homes and in home care, the first people on the list. But we also have to realize that we’re in a situation where there has to be some equity in the way this is distributed. And that requires, for example, right now we’re in a situation where you have the leading cause of death for all Americans this week is COVID-19. Well, blacks and Latinos are three times as likely to die if they get COVID-19. And so the communities of color, it’s a mass casualty event. And so we got to figure out how we make sure we get the vaccine to those communities, delivering large amounts of the vaccine to the Walmarts and other major drug chains does not get you into a lot of these neighborhoods. And it doesn’t guarantee that it gets around. So we got a lot of work to do. And the equity side of this has to be important part of distribution. In addition to that, the cost of actually getting the serum into an injection, into a needle into somebody’s arm costs a lot of money. It takes a lot of people. It takes a lot of folks to be able to get that done. And we have to have a much better way than we’ve seen thus far as to how it’s distributed. In some states, like the governor of Utah said, “Just deliver to the Capitol. I can take care of it,” in our conversation. Well, that could be true. But in large states like California, Texas, Illinois, Florida, et cetera, it’s just not that easy. There has to be an overall plan. That’s what we’re working on right now. … Overall plan. That’s what we’re working on right now. And that’s why I asked Dr. Fauci to stay on and to be my chief advisor on this issue, but also to be part of the COVID team. And on your cabinet, you are facing a lot of pressure to add more diversity to your administration. You have civil rights groups and lawmakers pushing you to do this, to make sure that you make good on your promise. And you look at your cabinet announcement so far, and they have included some diverse figures. But I specifically want to hone in on those big four. And so far when it comes to secretary of state and treasury, you have nominated a white man and a white woman. Look, it’s each one of these groups’ jobs to push their leaders to make sure there’s a greater diversity. What I can promise you is when this is all said and done, you see everyone that I’ve announced and it was going to be in the next several weeks, we’ll have it all out there, you’re going to see significant diversity. I’m not going to tell you now exactly what I’m going to do in any department, but I promise you it will be the single most diverse cabinet based on race, color, based on gender, that’s ever existed in the United States of America. Commitment of what I just said. It’ll be the most diverse cabinet in the main spots in both White House, as well as the cabinet positions. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President Elect. You just said a couple of minutes ago that there’s no time to waste when it comes to economic stimulus. But Democrats and Republicans have been in a stalemate for several months as they have been negotiating and trying to talk about what kind of stimulus to put together. You were elected by more than 80 million people to try to break that log jam. Can you talk about specifically what you have done over these past several weeks to actually work with Democrats and Republican speaking to congressional leaders to get them to agree on a stimulus package. And what do you say to people like Senator Sanders on the left flank of your party who have come out against this stimulus program already? They have said that this $900 billion deal is not good enough. Well, it would be kind of stupid for me to tell you what I did, wouldn’t it? Because it’d be kind of hard to do it again. I told you all that I was confident I can get a bipartisan agreement on this stuff. And I think we will not just on this package, but I think beyond. And the last thing I’m going to do is tell you strategically how I go about this. I remember I used to get asked the same thing when I was putting together significant deals between Democrats and Republicans when I was a Senator and vice-president. It’s just not a very smart thing for… It’s like me asking you, “Tell me how you get your sources and how’d you get those sources you’ve got in order to get that story?” That would be ridiculous for you to tell me or your colleagues how you did it. All I can say is I’m confident there are a sufficient number of Democrats and Republicans in the United States Senate, along with significant votes coming out of the House of Representatives, to put together a serious package that will keep us from going off the edge here, provide the kind of resources have needed immediately. It’s not going to satisfy everybody, but the option is if you insist on everything, we’re likely to get nothing on both sides. And so I think they’re on their way to being able to come up with a package that meets the basic, immediate needs that we have. But I’ve made it real clear, it’s just a down payment. This is not the end of the deal. So I’ve been relatively good at negotiating over my career because I never, number one, reveal something somebody doesn’t want me to in the deal, and number two because I’m always keep my word. There are a number of progressives, including Senator Sanders, who have criticized this deal. In part, because it does not include the $1,200 checks that were in the last deal. What do you say about that? They say that the American people who are hurting, maybe not the small businesses, but just the everyday families, they don’t have anything in this deal. They’re not getting any of the stimulus that’s in this $900 billion package. Well, that’s not what I understand, but I think it would be better if they had the $1,200 and I understand that may be still in play. But I’m not going to comment on the specific details. It costs a lot of money to keep schools and businesses open on the COVID side of the equation. They’re all pieces that should be in there. There’s much more if I were writing it, I think the proposal that quite frankly, the HEROES act that the house passed, that’s what I would support. But this is a democracy and you’ve got to find a sweet spot where you have enough people willing to move in a direction that gets us a long way down the road, but isn’t the whole answer. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President elect. You are describing this compromised bill as a down payment, that you’ll push Congress to do more once you’re in office. But this bill is already more than Republican leaders want to spend. I never start off thinking that way. I always start off, “We can get it done and we’ll get it done. But it’s been more than six months this fight has been going on. Mitch McConnell still hasn’t even signed off yet on this compromised bill. We’ll be in dire trouble if we don’t get cooperation, I believe we will. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President elect. You noted today that one in six renters are behind in their rent, millions of Americans remain unemployed, you say the situation is urgent. When you come into office, you expect to pass executive orders dealing with those specific issues. We’re looking at hundreds of billions of dollars. And look, again, I’ve learned after hanging around in this business for a while, the last thing you do before you begin a negotiation is lay down a drop dead marker. “And if it’s not this, I’m not going to talk to you.” I think there’s a lot we can get done and I think people are going to see the overwhelming necessity. What’s going to start to happen is a lot of folks who represent Republican districts are going to find their Republican neighbors are in real trouble as things get worse. They’re going to find that a there’s an overwhelming need as these numbers skyrocket. You remember my saying that I believe the experts, we’d have at least another 250 dead before the end of the year? And they went, “Oh, no.” Guess what? Look what’s happening. It’s going to get much worse. It’s going to get much worse. And so I believe that there are enough Republicans who will join enough Democrats in the United States Senate to get a majority along with the House to get it done. But we’ll see. We’ll see, this is a step at a time. Well, [inaudible 00:30:34] executive orders that are totally within the purview of an executive. But one of the things I don’t like is I don’t like people saying that I can, by executive order, to do the following things, which there is no basis in the constitution suggested can be done. So there are certain things I can do. I can issue executive orders, pulling back some of the executive orders that Trump put forward. But I can’t issue an executive order saying, “We’re going to spend X billion dollars on this issue,” without getting the Congress appropriates and who’s responsible for distributing that money. And then quickly on the coronavirus vaccine, you talked about getting it into African-American and vulnerable populations. You said yourself that you’re willing to get the vaccine publicly to get people to feel safe, but there are people already telling me, “Well, president elect Biden has good healthcare. If there’s some complications, he might have better healthcare than me, African-Americans around the country.” What more can you do to convince people that the vaccine is safe for them? And does that mean you’ll at all lean on any existing members of the corona task force? I know that you have committed to keeping Dr. Fauci, but is there Dr. There are a lot of people I’m looking to convince people in the task force and the task force will continue to be expanded with really fine people. And look, I think actions of presidents matter, and I’m going to say something that I think the African-American community, Latino community have known, and I’ve never misrepresented anything to them. And that if, as you all keep pointing out, I’m the oldest president ever elected, although I’m actually only 47. But all kidding aside, I think that my taking the vaccine and people seen me take that vaccine is going to give some confidence. But I said early on, you may remember, I think you may have asked me the question, I may be mistaken. But I said early on that I think one of the things that bothers me the most is by the wild assertions the administration is making about how this was going to go away and inject bleach and all those kinds of things. It was diminishing confidence across the board and the American people overall. … the African-American Latino community. What I hear from my friends in the community, not but blocks from here as we stand, is that we’re not going to be the guinea pigs. We’re not going to be the guinea pigs. Well, the fact of the matter is that they won’t be. You’re going to see tens of millions of Americans taking the vaccine, and you’re going to see the President of United States and three of the four living former Presidents doing it publicly as well. It’s going to take some effort to rebuild confidence in science, because it’s been so diminished in this administration thus far. But I will. And by the way, in the meantime, I’m going to make sure that the vaccine is both free and available, and that any follow up on the vaccine is free and available that relates to any health complications from it. So there’s ways we can deal with some of these issues. Biden has good healthcare, but I don’t have good healthcare. That’s another thing we’re working on from day one. I’ve been working on it at this moment. And so my hope is that we can reinstill some confidence and be able to believe the President of the United States when he or she speaks. Thank you. Thank you very much. Mr. Vice President, Michael from [inaudible 00:34:27]. Thank you, Mr. President-elect. So am I. … considering that we are still in the middle of the Coronavirus pandemic. So I’d like to hear what you envision for the inauguration. Well, first and foremost thing is we’re going to follow again, the science and the recommendation of the experts on keeping people safe. So it is highly unlikely there’ll be a million people on the Mall, going all the way down to the Memorial. I think we’ll see. We’re in discussion with the House leadership and the Senate leadership as to what they plan for the inauguration, particularly those 200,000 spots they control. But I think you’re going to see something that’s closer to what the convention was like than the typical inauguration. First and foremost, my objective is keep America safe, but still allow people to celebrate. To celebrate and see one another celebrating. And so we’re in consultation. My team is in consultation with folks who help us put on the convention as well as with our colleagues, Republican and Democratic colleagues in charge of the inauguration. My guess is there probably will not be a gigantic inaugural parade down Pennsylvania Avenue. But my guess is you’ll see a lot of virtual activity in states all across America, engaging even more people than before. But that’s in train now. And I’m not in a position to give you an example of exactly what it will look like. But I promise you, it’ll be available either virtually or in person for many. And my guess is it’ll still be some, there’ll still be a platform ceremony, but I don’t know exactly how it’s all going to work out. The key is keeping people safe. I can’t do a super version of the President’s announcement in the Rose Garden nationwide. So it’s going to have to be more imaginative. But I think, like I said, I think the convention we put on really opened up avenues that we never thought existed. And I doubt whether there’ll be another democratic, at least the democratic convention, that it’s a straight like it always has been. I think we include more people. People want to celebrate. People want to be able to say, we’ve passed the baton. We’re moving on. Democracy has functioned. I wish I could tell you more, but as those decisions are made, they’ll be announced. Okay. And I also wanted to ask you about your relationship with Senator McConnell. I know the two of you have a long history of actually working together on various deals. I don’t think I have to convince him of that. He knows me. He knows I’m as straight as an arrow when I negotiate. He knows I keep commitments and I never attempt to embarrass the opposition. There are some things that I think are just ready for the kind of compromise that Democrats and Republicans are prepared to engage in absent the present President of the United States’ attitudes on some of these issues. Infrastructure, dealing with health issues, dealing with the fight against cancer, dealing with education. I think there’s a number of things. As I said before, we’ve got to take the vitriol out of politics. I know there’s a lot of people on both sides who want to continue to go after and punish the opposition. I get that. I get the fact that an awful lot of Americans are disappointed I was elected President. Fortunately, there’s 7 million more that were happy than disappointed, but I get that. And there’s a lot of Democrats who are angry and want to strike back at republicans. What I’ve said from the beginning, and I think I’ve conducted myself this way throughout my career. I learned that early lesson. It’s always appropriate to question other man or woman’s judgment, but never their motive. Once you question their motive, then in fact, there’s no way to get to go. You’re in the pocket of the cement industry, let’s do a deal on highways. With no possibility. And so when I’ve dealt with Mitch McConnell in the past as a Vice President or as a Senator, we haven’t engaged in that activity. It doesn’t mean we can get to an agreement. I’m not asking anybody to abandon their principles, but I do think it makes no sense to engage in vitriol and trying to get the place where I can’t believe that a majority of the Republicans don’t understand we need a new infrastructure in America. If there was nothing to do with jobs or a green economy, there’s too many bridges that are going to collapse. Too many roads in disrepair. Too many Republican states that every time it floods, their water systems are polluted. These are common problems and I’m confident, it’s going to be hard, but I’m confident we can get to agreement on a number of things that will be of consequence. Thank you all so very, very much. Mr. Is that it? Thank you. Appreciate it. Thank you. [crosstalk 00:40:47]. [inaudible 00:40:49]. No, I don’t think it should be mandatory. I wouldn’t demand it to be mandatory, but I would do everything in my power, just like I don’t think mass have to be made mandatory nationwide, I’ll do everything in my power as the President of United States to encourage people to do the right thing. And when they do it, demonstrate that it matters. That’s why I said in my inaugural speech, I’m going to ask people to commit for 100 days to wear a mask. Not because I’m asking it for any reason to punish. This is not a political issue. It’s become one. But if people do it for 100 days in the middle of what will be still a raging crisis, and the vaccine is able to be distributed, they are going to see deaths drop off the edge. They’re going to see hundreds of thousands of people not getting sick. And my hope is they’ll be then inclined to say, okay, it’s worth the patriotic duty to go ahead and protect other people. Thank you all so very much. Thank you."
"156","12-08-20"," Folks. Good afternoon. Today, I’m very proud to be announcing our healthcare and COVID team at a critical time, as we near the end of one of the toughest years we’ve faced as a nation. More than 285,000 dead Americans because of COVID-19 and counting. Last week COVID-19 was the number one cause of death in America. For black, Latino, and Native Americans are nearly three times as likely to die from it. COVID-19 is a mass casualty. For families and friends left behind is a gaping hole in your heart that will never be fully heal. As a country, we’ve been living with this pandemic for so long, we’re at risk of becoming numb to its toll on all of us. We’re resigned to feel that there’s nothing we can do and we can’t trust one another. That we must accept death, pain and sorrow. We’re in the midst of this deadly pandemic that’s infected almost 15 million Americans. One out of every 22 people in our country, often with devastating consequences of health. At this very moment, what is the outgoing administration asking the Supreme Court to do in the United States Supreme Court? To repeal the entirety of the Affordable Care Act when we need it most. A law that’s on the front lines against the pandemic, protects more than a hundred million Americans who live with pre-existing conditions, which will increase now including those with lung scarring and heart damage as a consequence of COVID-19. It provides coverage for more than 20 million Americans who get the care they need if they’re showing symptoms of COVID-19. The law that fulfills our moral obligation here in America, healthcare is a right for all, not a privileged for a few. But as all of you know, I know that out of our collective pain, we’re going to find a collective purpose to control the pandemic, to save lives and to heal as a nation. Today, I’m pleased to announce a team that is going to do just that. It’s a team of world-class experts at the top of their fields, crisis tested, defined by a deep sense of duty, honor and patriotism who are already ready to jump in. They’ve been advising me, many of them for a long time, and they’re going to be ready on day one to spare not a single effort to get this pandemic under control. So we can get back to work, get back to our lives, get back to our loved ones. They’ll lead the COVID-19 response across the government to accelerate testing, fix our supply chain and distribute the vaccine. The work of my economic team, because controlling the pandemic, delivering better healthcare and reviving the economy go hand in hand. They’ll work with my foreign policy and national security teams because we can’t only beat the virus here at home, it must be beaten everywhere, or it comes back to haunt us again. Today, I’m announcing that in consultation with Dr. Tony Fauci, we developed the first three objectives, the new initiative that I’m asking this team to complete once I’m sworn in, in our first 100 days in office. My first 100 days won’t end the COVID-19 virus, I can’t promise that. But we did not get into this mess quickly, we’re not going to get out of it quickly. It’s going to take some time. But I’m absolutely convinced that in 100 days, we can change the course of the disease and change life in America for the better. First, my first 100 days is going to require, I’m going to ask for a masking plan. Everyone for the first 100 days of my administration to wear a mask. It will start with my sign in order on day one to require masks where I can under the law, like federal buildings, interstate travel on planes, trains and buses. I’ll also be working with the governors and mayors to do the same in their states and their cities. We’re going to require masks wherever possible. But this goes beyond government action. And so as the new president, I’m going to speak directly to the American people and say what I’m saying now, we need your help. Wear masks for just 100 days. It’s the easiest thing you can do to reduce COVID cases, hospitalizations, and death. Help yourself, your family and your community. Whatever your politics or point of view, mask up for 100 days once we take office. 100 days to make a difference. It’s not a political statement. It’s a patriotic act. It won’t be the end of our efforts, but it’s a necessary and easy beginning, an easy start. Secondly, this team, this team will help get at the latest at the last 100 million COVID-19 vaccine, at least 100 million COVID vaccine shots into the arms of the American people in the first 100 days. 100 million shots in the first 100 days. And we’ll follow the guidance of science to get the vaccines to those most at risk. That includes healthcare professionals, people in longterm care and as soon as possible, we will include educators. This will be the most efficient mass vaccination plan in U.S. history. I credit everyone who has gotten us up to this point. But developing a vaccine is only one Herculean task. Distributing it is another Herculean task. Vaccines in a vile, only work if they’re injected into an arm of people, especially those most at risk. This would be one of the hardest and most costly operational challenges in our nation’s history. We’re going to need Congress to fully fund vaccine distribution to all corners of the country, to everyone. I’m encouraged by the bipartisan efforts in Congress around a $900 billion economic relief package, which I’ve said is critical. But this package is only a start for more action early next year. We must also focus significant resources on direct public health response to COVID-19. Our preliminary view of Trump administration’s vaccine distribution plans confirms media reports. Without urgent action by this Congress this month to put sufficient resources into vaccine distribution and manufacturing, which the bipartisan group was working on. There’s a real chance that after an early round of vaccinations, the effort will slow and stall. Let me repeat. We need Congress to finish the bipartisan work underway now, or millions of Americans may wait months longer to get the vaccine, months longer than they otherwise would have to wait to get the vaccine, vaccination. Look, and then we’re going to need additional action next year to fund the rest of the distribution efforts. We also need the Trump administration to act now though, to purchase the doses it has negotiated with Pfizer and Moderna and to work swiftly to scale, manufacturing to U.S. populations and the world. This can be fixed. If it is fixed, my team will be able to get at least 100 million vaccinations done in my first 100 days. The third thing I’m going to ask in the 100 days, it should be a national priority to get our kids back into school and keep them in school. If Congress provides the funding we need to protect students, educators, and staff, if states and cities put strong public health measures in place that we all follow, then my team will work to see that a majority of our schools can be open by the end of my first 100 days. That’s right. We’ll look to have the most schools open that we can possibly in 100 days, if Congress provides the funding we need. It’s not a secret how to do it. Masking, vaccinations, opening schools. These are the three key goals for my first 100 days, but we’ll still have much to do in the year ahead and sadly much difficulty as well. We’ll be far, far from done, yet it’s possible after 100 days we’ll be much further along in the fight against this pandemic. And I’m grateful to the members of my COVID team that I’d like to introduce to you now who will lead the way. I’m really proud of this group. For secretary of health and education, I nominate Javier Becerra, Becerra, excuse me. He currently is the Attorney General of California leading the second largest Justice Department in America, only behind the United States Department of Justice. And for nearly 25 years before that he was a Congressman representing Los Angeles, one of the largest, America’s largest and most diverse cities. Javier spent a career fighting to expand access to healthcare, reducing racial health disparities, protecting the Affordable Care Act and take on powerful special interests who prey on profit off of people’s health from opioid manufacturers to big tobacco. During this pandemic he’ll protect the safety of the frontline healthcare workers, rooted out the fraud from the bad actors to take advantage of people. And he stood up for homeowners trying to pay their mortgages during this devastating economic crisis. There are things he’s already fought for and accomplished in many cases. And as secretary, HHS secretary, he will skillfully oversee the CDC and the FDA, Medicare and Medicaid. No matter what happens in the Supreme court, he’ll lead our efforts to build on the Affordable Care Act. He’ll work to dramatically expand coverage and take bold steps to lower healthcare and prescription drug costs. Javier is a key leader who leads a key agency charged with protecting the health and wellness of the American people. He’s also the first Latino leading the HHS. The son of a working family class, working class immigrant family that came from Mexico, a true public servant who’s dedicated his career to the service of the people and the service of this country that we all love. To serve as coordinator of the COVID-19 response team, I’m turning to a world-class manager and leader. I’ve known Jeff for a long time from the first and last days of the Obama and Biden White House and throughout the campaign and now the transition. There’s no one else that you’d want to help manage some of the most consequential and complex priorities of a country. …some of the most consequential and complex priorities of a country. Director of national economic council for President Obama, acting director for the office of management and budget he’s there, was there, during the great recession, as he went from crisis to recovery, to resurgence in eight years. He was there to lead the team and help implement the Affordable Care Act and get healthcare.gov up, and working at a critical moment. That was a monumental feat that required vision patience, experience, fortitude, and real expertise. Well-respected across the aisle and around the country from business to labor leaders, to entrepreneurs, to educators, chairman of the board, the children’s national medical center, one of the world’s top children’s hospitals, Jeff knows how to build and lead a team, how to identify and solve problems and how to fully mobilize the federal government on behalf of the health, safety, and prosperity of the American people. Jeff Zients, thank you for be willing to do this again. The surgeon general of the United States, I nominate, a man who could do any of these jobs, I think, but Dr. Vivek Murthy, he’s worked with me for a long time. He’s a renowned physician and research scientist, a trusted national leader on healthcare. And for me, a trusted advisor during the campaign and transition. This will be the second time serving as America’s doctor having served in this role under President Obama. [inaudible 00:16:36] During his tenure, he took on some of the most pressing public health issues we face, [inaudible 00:16:43] excuse me, from the opioid crisis, to threats to America’s mental health. I’ve asked Dr. Murphy to serve again as surgeon general, but with expanded responsibilities. He will be a key public voice on the COVID response to restore public trust and faith in science and medicine. One of the reasons doc, I asked you to do this, when you speak people, listen. They trust you. You have a way of communicating. They can just see it in your eyes. I mean, it sincerely, it’s a really, really important thing to be communicated now, when people aren’t so much doubt. He’ll also be a key advisor to me and help lead all government approach to broader public health issues. We’ve talked a lot about the need to vastly increased focus on mental health of the country, addiction and substance use disorders, social and environmental detriments to health, and much more. So I’m really looking forward. And thank you for doing this above all, I believe as well as any person I’ve ever worked with, Vivek can help restore faith in this country as a place of possibilities, the son of Indian immigrants who raised their children to always believe in the promise of America. Dr. Murphy will be one of my most trusted public health and medical advisers. And I’m grateful. I mean, this sincerely, Vivek. I’m grateful for your willingness to continue to stay in public service. And for director of the Center for Disease Control, the CDC and prevention, I might add. I appoint Rochelle Walensky. She’s Chief of Infectious Disease at one of the country’s most preeminent hospitals, Massachusetts General in Boston, a distinguished professor at Harvard Medical School and a world-class physician. One of the nations foremost experts on testing, treatment and eradication of viruses. She has served on the front lines, on the COVID crisis. She’s conducted groundbreaking research on vaccine delivery, including how to reach underserved communities that are too often hit first, hardest, and treated last. Dr. Walensky’s work was instrumental in helping the world mitigate the public health crisis of HIV AIDS. It inspired her as a young doctor to pursue her pioneering research in virus containment. Now she’ll bring her expertise to bear against COVID-19. She’s uniquely qualified to restore morale and public trust. She’ll marshal our finest scientists and public health experts as CDC to turn the tide on this urgent crisis we’re facing today. Because of the pandemic’s disproportionate impact on communities of color, I concluded that I wanted, we needed, a COVID-19 equity task force. To chair that, to chair it, I appoint Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith. One of the country’s foremost experts on healthcare disparities, Associate Professor of Medicine and Public Health and Management at Yale School of Medicine, founding director of Yale’s Equity Research and Innovation Center. And co-chair of my COVID-19 transition advisory board. Dr. Nunez-Smith will lead our efforts to provide care to the communities most in need and most effected by the pandemic and often overlooked. She’ll ensure that fairness and equity are at the center of every part of our response. This is a central front in our fight against this pandemic. And I’m grateful Dr. Nunez-Smith will lead this charge. And finally, as both head of my national Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease and my chief medical advisor on COVID-19, I’m pleased to say that Dr. Tony Fauci will be a member of my COVID team. By now, Tony needs, Dr. Fauci needs no introduction, but he’ll have my gratitude when I’m president, the seventh president, he will have served. We know each other and we’ve known each other for a long time. And I’m so grateful when I called him almost before I asked, he said, “Yes.” I’ve seen him take on HIV AIDS, H1N1, Ebola, Zika, COVID-19 and every infectious disease in between over nearly 40 years of service to our country, Dr. Fauci is trusted, a truth teller, a patriot. Like every good doctor, he’ll tell me what I need to know, not what I want to know, what I need to know, not what I want to know. This is my core COVID healthcare team. Before January 20th, we’ll be adding more leaders to oversee vaccine distribution, the supply chain, testing, and other key functions to each of you on this team, you have my gratitude. And I mean that, you have my gratitude for answering the call to serve and to your families. I know many of you are making real sacrifices to do this. Thank you. And to your families. I say, thank you directly. We couldn’t do this without them or without you, and the family supporting this. And to the American people I know we’ve all had a lot of sleepless nights this year. So many of you staring at the ceiling at night worrying “My God, what happens? What happens if it strikes my family? What happens if I lose my insurance? What happens? Am I going to be okay? Is my family going to be okay?” All I can tell you is the truth. We’re in a very dark winter things may well get worse before they get better. A vaccine may soon be available. We need to level with one another. It’ll take longer than we would like to distribute it to all corners of the country, depending on how it gets started off between now and the time I’m sworn in. We’ll need to persuade enough Americans to take the vaccine. Many of them have become very cynical about its usefulness. It’s daunting, but I promise you that we’ll make progress starting on day one. We didn’t get into this mess quickly. It’s going to take time to fix, but we can do this. That’s the truth. I’m telling you the truth, is what this team, Vice President-Elect Harris, and I will always do. Give it to you straight from the shoulder, as Roosevelt used to say. This is the toughest challenge America’s ever faced. One of the toughest. We know that we can overcome and heal together as one nation. For all of you on the front lines, the healthcare professionals, first responders, grocery store workers, delivery truck drivers, educators, parents, our children. I say, thank you, but we can do this. We can do this. I want to thank you for everything you’ve done to get us through this crisis so far, we’re never going to give up on you, I promise you. We’ll never give up on our country. We can do this. There’s nothing we’ve ever failed to do when we decided to do it together. Together, that’s America. So, all those who’ve lost in this pandemic, all those who are sick and suffering, our hearts go out to you. Many of us know what it’s like. May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you for listening. Now, I’d like to turn it over to the team, starting with our next secretary of health and human service. Xavier Becerra. And Xavier, thank you for being willing to take on the responsibility. Along with Carolina, my wife, and Natalia, Olivia, Clarisa, and Yvonne, greetings from California. Mr. President-Elect, Madam Vice President-Elect, I am honored and excited to join your team. The mission of the Department of Health and Human Services has never been as vital or as urgent as it is today. The COVID pandemic and its economic fall would have thrust families into crisis. Too many Americans are sick or have lost loved ones. Too many have lost their jobs. And with that, their healthcare and hope. You have made it clear. Mr. President-Elect that to build back a prosperous America, we need a healthy America. That then will be job one for your team at HHS. 55 years ago, during another time of hardship, former health secretary and fellow Californian, John Gardner said, what we have before us are some breathtaking opportunities disguised as insoluble problems. Gardner went on to help president Lyndon Johnson build a great society ushering and Medicare, Medicaid, and civil rights that brought greater equity, greater opportunity and greater hope to all Americans. Now it’s our turn to discover the breathtaking opportunities before us in the midst of this hardship and pain. It’s our turn to build up and to backup our doctors and medical professionals, our hospitals and clinics battling the Coronavirus, our turn to restore faith and confidence in our leaders to deliver solutions that unite and heal us and inoculate us from fear. Our turn to spur our brightest minds to launch the next generation of innovative medicines and cures. And it is our turn to build a nation where, as the President-Elect so often says healthcare is a right, not a privilege. At HHS, tackling pandemics, saving lives, keeping us healthy should be our calling card. And we won’t forget that there is a second H in HHS, the human services, the work we do for our children, seniors, and disabled, they will stand tall in a Biden Harris, HHS. Almost a year ago on New Year’s Day, my father Manuel passed away peacefully at home surrounded by his family. We got to celebrate Christmas together. And when the end came, my dad knew we were there with him. No one, no one should ever have to die alone in a hospital bed, loved ones forced to stay away. That seems so contrary to the values of a great nation. The values that drew my parents, like generations before and after them to come to America, Manuel and Maria Theresa had only their health and hope when they arrived in California, a road construction worker with a sixth grade education and a clerical worker who arrived in her teens from Guadalajara, Jalisco Mexico. As they help build a better California, they built a pretty good partnership that lasted 67 years. And while they never got to experience the inside of a college, they did send their four kids there as well as to the military. Now, President-Elect Biden has offered me a breathtaking opportunity to work with his team to shape our healthcare future. I shared the president elect and Vice President-Elect’s determination to rebuild unity and civility in America. We know it takes hard work. We know we must do it together. We know it will be key to building critical momentum and support for the prevention and treatment of the coronavirus. Those values and priorities will help us emerge from this pandemic, a stronger, more just, and more equitable nation. Literally, there are millions of small business owners and tens of millions of workers who are counting on us. I am proud to have this chance to implement the President-Elect’s vision for a better America through the challenging assignments that are in store for the Department of Health and Human Services. Mr. President-Elect Madam Vice President-Elect, thank you for this opportunity to serve. Dr. Mr. President-Elect, Madam Vice President-Elect, thank you for your trust and your confidence. I bring greetings and thanks also from my grandmother, Sarojini, my mother and father, Myetraie and Hallegere Murthy… Dr. [inaudible 00:30:01] My mother and father, Myetraie and Hallegere Murthy, for my sister Rashmi and brother-in-law Ahmed, and for my dear wife Alice and my dear children, [inaudible 00:30:11] and [inaudible 00:00:12], we thank you for this opportunity to serve. Dr. When I left my role as surgeon general, I never dreamed I would have the opportunity to serve again. And in this moment of crisis, when so many Americans have fallen sick and lost loved ones, when people have lost their jobs and are struggling for childcare, I feel grateful to be able to do everything I can to end this pandemic. Dr. While this is a daunting task, we absolutely have, as a country, what we need to overcome this virus. We have world-class scientists. We have courageous medical professionals who are risking their lives to care for the ill. We have companies that are on the cusp of delivering vaccines. And most of all, we are blessed with generous and compassionate people all across America, who are stepping up to help those who are struggling. If we work together, we will overcome this pandemic and returned to our lives. Dr. But COVID-19 is not the only health crisis we face. If anything, it has underscored a host of other epidemics that are devastating families and shortening lifespans. Crises like addiction, including the opiod crisis, our aspiring mental health concerns, our glaring racial health disparities, and the high rates of chronic illness that we face, like diabetes and heart disease. These challenges are both caused by, but also exacerbated by, broader societal issues. From the economic strain so many people are facing to the disconnection and loneliness that many of us feel. In my new expanded role, I will work to bring a health focus to our policies across government so that our schools, our workplaces, and our communities can be forces for strengthening our health and wellbeing. Dr. But the truth is that the very best policies, and even the best vaccines and treatments, will not heal our nation unless we also overcome the fear, anxiety, anger, and distrust that so many Americans are feeling right now. Dr. So, more than anything, I will come to this role as a doctor. One who learned the most important lessons about medicine, not in medical school, but from the clinic that my parents opened when they first came to America as immigrants decades ago. As a child, I saw how they took their time, not just to diagnose illnesses, but to ask their patients’ families about their lives, to pour over pictures of children and grandchildren that were pulled from wallets. They listened deeply to people’s stories and their struggles, often running well over their appointment time. And they taught me that the best doctor is not an authority figure who writes prescriptions, but rather a partner in healing. Someone who sees patients in their fullest humanity and empowers them to take charge of their health. Dr. That is the kind of doctor I have always tried to be. And if confirmed, that is the kind of surgeon general that I will strive to be. I will dedicate myself to caring for every American. Driven always by science and facts, by head and by heart, and endlessly grateful to serve one of the few countries in the world where the grandson of a poor farmer in India could be asked by the president elect to look out for the health of an entire nation. That is a testament to the promise of America. One that I will seek to fulfill every day as surgeon general. Thank you so much. And thank you again, Mr. President-Elect and Madam Vice President-Elect for this opportunity to serve. Thank you, Vivek. Thank you. Mr. President-Elect, Madam Vice President-Elect, I am honored by the trust you have placed in me to serve the American people during this critical time. I want to thank my amazing husband and our three wonderful sons for answering this call along with me. As all doctors and public servants know, these jobs ask a great deal, not only of us, but of our families. The pandemic that brought me here today is one that struck America and the world more than 30 years ago, because my medical training happened to coincide with some of the most harrowing years of the HIV/AIDS crisis. As a medical student, I saw firsthand how the virus ravaged bodies and communities. Inside the hospital, I witnessed people lose strength and hope. While outside the hospital, I witnessed those same patients, mostly gay men and members of vulnerable communities, be stigmatized and marginalized by their nation and many of its leaders. A scientific breakthrough came in 1995 when the FDA approved the first AIDS cocktail and we saw the first glimmers of hope. I’ve dedicated my career ever since to researching and treating infectious diseases and to ending the HIV/AIDS crisis for good. Now, a new virus is ravaging us. It’s striking hardest, once again, at the most vulnerable, the marginalized, the underserved. Nearly 15 million Americans have been infected. Over 280 million loved ones are gone. The pain is accelerating. Our defenses have worn down. We are losing life and hope at an alarming rate. I never anticipated I would take on a role helping lead our national response and government service was never part of my plan. But every doctor knows that when a patient is coding, your plans don’t matter. You answer the code. And when the nation is coding, if you are called to serve, you serve. You run to take care of people, to stop the bleeding, to stabilize, to give them hope and a fighting chance to come back stronger. That’s what doctors do. I’m honored to work with an administration that understands that leading with science is the only way to deliver breakthroughs, to deliver hope, and to bring our nation back to full strength. To the American people and to each and every one of you at the CDC, I promise to work with you to harness the power of American science, to fight this virus and prevent unnecessary illness and deaths so that we can all get back to our lives. Mr. President-Elect, Madam Vice President-Elect, I thank you for this opportunity. Thank you, doctor. Mr. President-Elect, Madam Vice President-Elect, thank you so much for this opportunity to serve the American people. I’m proud to go to work with leaders who are deeply committed to science and to centering equity in our response to this pandemic. And not as a secondary concern, not as a box to check, but as a shared value woven into all of the work that we do and prioritized by every member of the Biden-Harris team. I’m enormously thankful to my research team and to my colleagues, to President Salovey and the other leadership here at Yale for supporting me in this work. And I’m grateful to all of the researchers and advocates who’ve blazed the trail, whose work on health equity and racial justice too often went unbelieved or overlooked across the generations. Most of all, I’m thankful to my family. To Jesse and our three children for their unwavering support and humor, and to my mother and her mother for modeling kindness, generosity, and courageous leadership through service. I have wanted to be a doctor since I was six years old. And I’m a proud general internal medicine physician today. But as I grew up, I came to understand that there were deeper dimensions to health beyond what I saw in the human biology textbooks that I borrowed from my mother’s bookshelf. I grew up on St. Thomas in the US Virgin islands, a place where people too often died too young from preventable conditions. My own father had his first stroke in his 40s and was left paralyzed. I learned there was a term for what we were: An underserved community, marginalized by place and by race. In my medical training, I saw countless patients whose conditions were shaped by factors having nothing to do with science and everything to do with broader social inequity. And now the COVID-19 crisis has laid those inequities bare. It is not a coincidence and it is not a matter of genetics that more than 70% of African-Americans and more than 60% of Latinx Americans personally know someone who has been hospitalized or died from COVID-19. The same disparities ingrained in our economy, our housing system, our food system, our justice system, and so many other areas of our society have conspired in this moment to create a grief gap that we cannot ignore. It is our societal obligation to ensure equitable access to testing, treatments, and vaccines, equitable support for those who are hurting, and equitable pathways to opportunity as we emerge from this crisis and rebuild, including for those most marginalized communities: The undocumented, the incarcerated, the homeless. I’m grateful for this chance to continue this work, to earn trust and to find success through genuine partnerships with the people and communities who’ve been hit the hardest during and before the crisis. On this team, you will be heard, you will be counted, and you will be valued. Thank you. Dr. President-Elect Biden and Vice President-Elect Harris, thank you so much for asking me to be part of this COVID response team. I hope that you don’t mind that a reason that I am sending this video is because a close friend and colleague at the NIH, Dr. Harvey Alter, is receiving the Nobel Prize in Medicine at the same time and we wanted to attend the ceremony at the NIH to show our support. Such an achievement is a reminder of the incredible public servants we have at the NIH and of America’s place as a pioneer in science and medicine. Dr. I believe, as you do, that in the fight against this pandemic, we must lead with science, and that a key piece of our ongoing work is communicating consistently with the American people. Whether it’s maintaining social distancing and not congregating indoors, or the 100 day challenge you described on masking, or to get as many people vaccinated as possible. Dr. These actions are bold, but they are doable and essential to help the public avoid unnecessary risks, to help us save lives, reopen schools and businesses, and to eventually beat the pandemic. I look forward to advising you on these most urgent priorities and to work with this team of world-class experts, whom I have known for many years and deeply respect. Dr. I have been through many public health crises before, but this is the toughest one we have ever faced as a nation. The road ahead will not be easy. We have got a lot of hard and demanding work to do in the next year, but as we have done during previous crises, I also know we can get through this pandemic together as a nation. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to be part of this effort. President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Harris, I’m honored by your trust in me and humbled by the task at hand, and I am hopeful because of your leadership. As it is for both of you, everything starts with family for me, and I’m forever grateful for the love and support of my wife, our children, and our parents. Mr. President-elect, we’ve known each other for a long time, and our relationship has been forged under immense pressure. The severity of the Great Recession, the challenge of implementing the Affordable Care Act, and the daily decisions a White House makes that affects the lives of millions of Americans. You and President Obama knew how to build a team with the right diversity of backgrounds and views, a team to make progress on difficult situations and capture enormous opportunities. That’s what I’ve tried to do throughout my career. I’m not a doctor or a public health expert. In fact, we’ve got the best ones in the world on this team, but I do know management and execution. And the key part of the role you’ve asked me to take on is the last part: Coordinator. It’s about empowering experts, developing a culture of teamwork, and maintaining a focus on strategy and execution. It’s knowing that leadership requires expertise, transparency, and prioritization. It also requires trust, truth, and integrity. To the American people, that’s what this team will provide. We will utilize the full capacity of the federal government to get this pandemic under control, to harness and examine the data to expand testing, to deliver equipment and PPE to those on the front lines, to provide resources for schools and businesses to operate safely, to address the racial disparities and inequities of this pandemic, to rejoin the global fight against COVID-19, because no one is safe until everyone is safe. And with our collective expertise, we will oversee the rollout of the vaccine, which as the President-elect said, will be one of the greatest operational challenges our country has ever faced. And we also will pull the country together across governments at the federal, state, and local levels, and across the private sector. And as we begin this work, Mr. President-elect, I remember what you told me when we were implementing the Affordable Care Act. Your message was, “I know this is no small task. I know you and the team are feeling tremendous pressure to succeed, and we want and need the team to pull this off.” You then said, “I know you and the team can do this, but I need you to promise me one thing: That you will always, always give it to us straight, because we have to understand the challenge we’re facing. Because most of all, we’re in this together, and together we can do this. President-elect Biden, Vice President-elect Harris, and the American people, this team will always give it to you straight. The work ahead will not be easy, but we know what needs to be done and we will get it done together. Thank you. Well, congratulations, Mr. President-elect, on nominating and appointing a most outstanding team to get this pandemic under control. And thank you to these accomplished physicians, and experts, and public servants for answering the call to serve the American people in this critical hour of need. Over Thanksgiving, the President-elect and I called healthcare workers who are on the front lines of this pandemic, just to thank them. We wanted to express our gratitude and our nation’s gratitude for everything they have been doing, for every sacrifice they have made. That day, I spoke with two registered nurses, Maureen in Pennsylvania and Talisa in Illinois. They shared stories that we’ve all heard. We’ve all heard the stories about grandmothers and grandfathers, loved ones and friends, spending their last moments alone. We’ve all heard about nurses and physicians who are physically and mentally exhausted, trying to keep up with ever-increasing case loads. Those on the front line who say to each other, “It’s a matter not of when, but when they will get the virus.” So, “It is a matter of when and not if they get the virus.” This is what they’re saying to each other every day. We’ve all heard about health care workers without the supplies and equipment they need to care for patients and save lives. So today we have a message for Talisa, Maureen, and all Americans. Help is on the way, and it is long overdue. The scale of this pandemic is heartbreaking. As you know and have heard, almost 15 million cases, more than 2,800 deaths in a single day. And then there is the economic devastation, the lost jobs, the small businesses shuttered, not to mention what’s happening to our schools, the parents and teachers who are being stretched to their limits, and the toll it’s taking on the mental health and wellbeing of our children who risk each day falling behind. Opening our schools and economy safely and responsibly, getting this virus under control, all of it starts with listening to experts and leaders like these. Americans who reflect the very best of our nation. They are top physicians, public health experts, and public servants, and they are the team that the American people need and deserve, to make sure testing and treatment are free for everyone, to make sure vaccines are safe, free, and equitably distributed, to make sure we are better prepared for future pandemics and other health threats, and to make sure quality, affordable healthcare is available to all. From an early age, I saw the life saving work that our healthcare professionals provide, especially for the most vulnerable among us. You see, my mother was a breast cancer researcher, and my sister and I spent many hours roaming the hallways of the hospital where she worked. I’m sure your kids have too. And it’s why I actually later co-founded an auxiliary group to help patients at the County Hospital in Oakland, California, more than 20 years ago. It’s why we need to protect and expand the Affordable Care Act, and it’s why we have to listen to front line healthcare workers like Maureen and Talisa. In fact, during our conversation, Talisa said, “We wouldn’t send our soldiers to battle without the gear they need, and we shouldn’t then send our doctors and our nurses to fight this pandemic without the gear they need.” And of course, she’s right. And President-elect Biden and I, along with this world-class team, we’ll make sure we are doing everything we can to save lives and contain this pandemic once and for all. Getting this virus under control is one of the defining challenges of our time, and we will do what the American people have always done in the face of a great challenge. We will stand together and we will defeat it. Thank you."
"157","12-09-20"," Please be seated. Good afternoon. Today it’s my great honor and it really is an honor to add to my NASA security team leader of extraordinary courage, character, experience, and accomplishment. And a man who I’ve seen some of the more interesting parts of the world with when I was vice president. Someone with whom I have worked closely for many years and I’ve seen perform to the highest standards under intense pressure. Someone who I hold in the highest personal regard as a man of great decency and a man of dignity. In my judgment, there’s no question that he is the right person for this job at the right moment, leading the Department of Defense at this moment in our nation’s history. He’s led major coalitions of allies and partners to fight terrorism and it took some real diplomatic capacity to get that done. He’s overseeing some of the most complex logistical efforts ever undertaken by the United States military. Helped end a war and literally bring tens of thousands of troops home safely. He’s loved by the men and women of the armed forces, feared by our adversaries, known and respected by our allies. And he shares my deeply held belief in the values of America’s alliances. And he is just as committed as I am to rebuilding and modernizing those alliance from the Asia-Pacific to Europe and around the world. Through sheer determination and extraordinary skill, he’s been breaking down barriers and blazing a trail forward in this nation for many years now, for more than 40 years. And he has a long way to go and going to do it again. And so today I’m honored to nominate former General Lloyd Austin as the 28th Secretary of Defense. I want to thank you, General. You’re a friend, but I want to thank you General Austin for once more stepping forward to serve your nation. This is not a post he sought, but I sought him. And I want to thank you and your family for once again sharing you with our country and thanks Charlene. Today, I know how proud they all are of you, all four of your children, your older sisters and your brother. I knew the reason why you’re a good man, you had to have sisters to raise you along the way, right? I know mine did me and she’s much younger. And your incredible wife, Charlene and I mean that sincerely. Tomorrow, I’m told that Jill and Charlene are going to spend some time together sending off packages to our soldiers abroad. She and Jill are both passionate about supporting military spouses and families. And I know they’ll be powerful advocates for that community together. And they’re going to both be working at the White House and the defense department together to make sure our families are [inaudible 00:07:19] I said before General, American only has many obligation, one sacred obligation to care and equip those we send the war and care for their families when they’re gone and to care for them when they come home and their families. I got to know General Austin during my early days as vice president. President Obama had charged me with overseeing the end of Operation Iraqi Freedom and ensuring the orderly withdrawal of our forces and equipment from Iraq. General Austin was with me on the ground, not just for meetings with troops or for military strategy sessions. He was there when I was working with Iraq political leaders, I watched his political skill and how he dealt with them. They respected him across the board. With them. They respected him across the board. When I met with the leaders of our coalition partners, the same thing. He was there during one particularly memorable incident when we were at a meeting at the ambassador’s residence in the Green Zone. The insurgents launched a rocket attack on the House. Of course, General Austin, it was just another day at the office. He just sat there and kept right on going, so I sat there and kept right on going and wondered, “What in the hell are they doing?” But he’s cool under fire, inspiring the same and all those around him. That’s Lloyd Austin. He was the person President Obama and I entrusted with the incredible task of bringing home America’s forces and redeploying our military equipment safely out of Iraq. It was the largest logistical operation undertaken by the army in 60 years. Getting it done required much more than the military know-how. General Austin was a diplomat. It was not an easy task. He built relationships with our Iraqi counterparts and with our coalition partners. He was a statesman representing our country with a skill at tables that I’ve sat with him with foreign leaders, and I wondered whether or not he was from the State Department or from the Defense Department, both military and civilians. I’m not exaggerating. He has a way about him, and always, above all, he’s looked out for his people. That’s why he was known as the soldiers’ leader. In this time in the United States Army, Lloyd Austin met every single challenge with extraordinary skill and profound personal decency. He’s the definition of duty, honor, country. At every step, he challenged the institutions that he loves to grow more inclusive and more diversive. He was the 200th person ever to attain the rank of a four-star general, but only the sixth African-American to ever do that. He was the first African-American general officer to lead the Army Corps in combat. He was the first African-American to command an entire theater of war, and, if confirmed, he’ll be the first African-American at the helm of the Defense Department in well over 200 years, another milestone, and he’s a barrier-breaking career, has been like this throughout his career. Lloyd Austin retired from the military service more than four years ago, but the law states that an officer must have left the service seven years before becoming secretary of defense. There’s a good reason for this law that I fully understand and respect. I would not be asking for this exception if I did not believe this moment in our history didn’t call for it. It does call for it and if I didn’t have the faith I have in Lloyd Austin to ask for it. I believe in the importance of civilian control of the military, so does the Secretary-designate Austin. He’ll be bolstered by a strong and empowered civilian sector and senior officers, senior officials, I should say, working to shape DOD’s policies and ensure that our defense policies are accountable to the American people. Civilian military dynamic, that dynamic itself has been under great stress the past four years. I know that Secretary-designee Austin is going to work tirelessly to get it back on track. I have personally worked with this man. I’ve seen him lead American fighting forces on the field of battle. I’ve also watched him faithfully carry out the orders of the civilian leadership of this nation. There’s no doubt in my mind, not any doubt whatsoever, whether this nominee will honor, respect, and on a day-to-day basis breathe life into the preeminent principle of civilian leadership over military matters in our nation. I know this man. I know his respect for our constitution. I know his respect for our system of government. Just as they did for Secretary Jim Mattis, I asked the Congress to grant a waiver for Secretary-designee Austin. His many strengths and his intimate knowledge of the Department of Defense and our government I think are uniquely suited for the challenges we face now, the crisis we face now. He is the person we need at this moment, in my opinion. Given the urgent threat and challenges of our nation’s forces, he should be confirmed swiftly. We need his experience in large scale logistical operations to help support the swift and equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. We need his experience building and managing relationships, engaging in diplomacy with our partners to help rebuild America’s alliance and strengthen our shared security, and we need his firsthand knowledge of the immeasurable costs of war and the burden of places on our service members and their families to help bring to an end the forever wars and ensure that the use of force is the last tool in our toolbox, the last tool resorted to to protect our national security, not the first. We need his deep understanding of the Pentagon to help reform the Defense Department. We need his personal experience helping inform our efforts to ensure that our armed forces reflect the full strength and diversity of our nation, that black, Latino, Asian American, Native American, women, men, LGBT, service members are treated with dignity and respect at a time when, listen to this, more 40% of our active duty forces are people of color. It’s long past time that the department’s leadership reflects that diversity, and we need his in-depth understanding of what it takes to deter threats wherever they arise and to defend the American people, our vital interests, and our allies from harm just as he did when he was designated to lead the strategy together with the dozen of partner nations to ultimately crush ISIS. If you don’t think that required some diplomatic skill putting that group together, then you don’t understand what was going on. He did a heck of a job. Threats we face today are not the same as those we faced 10 years ago or even 5 years ago. We must prepare to meet the challenges for the future, of the future, not just keeping fighting wars of the past. We must build a foreign policy that leads with diplomacy, revitalizes state department, revitalizes our alliances, putting American leadership back at the table and rallying the world to meet global threats of our security, from pandemics to climate change, from nuclear proliferation to the refugee crisis. As part of our diverse national security leadership team, Lloyd Austin knows how to do this work. Before I turn the podium over to the Secretary-designee Austin, I want to end on a note of personal privilege. As a leader, General Austin has always followed the advice given to him by his first platoon sergeant. As my son, Beau Biden, who was a major in the military, I said, “Now your a field-grade officer.” He said, “I don’t have any illusions, Dad.” He said, “I know who runs the United States Army. Platoon sergeants.” Here’s what his platoon sergeant told him. “If you focus on your people, take care of them, get out in front and lead them, they’ll refuse to let you fail.” That’s why he’s inspired so many young people who work for him and give their very best to live up to his example of leadership. Including for a time, a young lawyer serving a year in Iraq as a captain with his Delaware National Guard unit, my son Beau Biden. I know how proud Beau was to serve on the general’s staff, Gen. Austin’s staff. And I know that under your leadership, General, the Department of Defense will advance the security of the American people in ways that always, always, always honor our highest values and ideals. So I thank you again, General. May God bless America, and may God protect our troops, and now I’d like to turn it over to Gen. Austin, the secretary-designee for the Department of Defense. Mr. President-elect and Madam Vice President-elect Harris, thank you for your trust and your confidence and for the opportunity to serve as the 28th Secretary of Defense. If confirmed by the United States Senate, it will be my sincere honor and privilege to return to the department and to lead our great service members and civilians in accomplishing the mission of ensuring our nation’s security. Back in 1877, a young man from the small town of Thomasville, Georgia, Henry Ossian Flipper, became the first African American to graduate from the United States Military Academy at West Point. After his commissioning, he was assigned to one of the Army’s all-Black regiments. He became the first non-white officer to lead the Buffalo Soldiers of the 10th Cavalry. So fast forward to today, nearly 150 years later, another native son of Thomasville, Georgia stands before you as the Secretary of Defense-designate. Now, many people have paved the way for me and countless others over the years to include Henry O. Flipper. I am supremely grateful to all of them for their courage, for their determination, and for the example that they set throughout. They include the Tuskegee Airman, and the Montfort Point Marines, and many others. Throughout my career I’ve also been incredibly fortunate to benefit from the support and the mentorship of exceptional leaders like Gen. Colin Powell, and Adm. Mike Mullen, and Gen. Johnnie Wilson, and my old platoon sergeant who you heard the president-elect just talk about. You know, I was a brand new second lieutenant, and Sgt. 1st Class Fox Ballard took me in and taught me the way of the world, so I owe him and many others a great deal. As Sir Isaac Newton famously said, “If I have seen a little further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.” I’ve been very fortunate to have the love and support of my family as well. My mother and father, who was a postal worker who along with a number of my uncles and other relatives spent time in the military and that inspired my own desire to serve. I’ve also enjoyed the strong support of my brother and four older sisters. Four older sisters. And most importantly, most importantly, my bride Charlene, who I’ve been truly lucky to have by my side all these years, and I am so grateful for her enduring love and for her support. You know, I spent much of my military career tackling tough issues and formidable adversaries in challenging parts of the world. And President-elect Biden, as you mentioned, we’ve worked closely together on some tough issues, and we’ve gotten to know each other under some intense and high-pressures situations. Sir, you can expect that as secretary of defense, that I will give you the same direct and unvarnished counsel that I did back then. I understand the important role of the Department of Defense and the role that it plays in maintaining stability and deterring aggression, and defending and supporting and critical alliances around the world, including in the Asia Pacific, in Europe, and around the world. I fervently believe that, as you’ve said before sir, that America is strongest when it works with its allies. Over the years I’ve worked hand in hand with our diplomatic colleagues and partners around the globe and witnessed firsthand what we’re able to accomplish together. So if confirmed, I look forward to resuming this important work. My career has taught me something else equally fundamental to who we are as a nation. When I concluded my military service four years ago, I hung up my uniform for the last time and went from being Gen. Lloyd Austin, to Lloyd Austin. It is an important distinction and one that I make with utmost seriousness and sincerity. So I come to this role, this new role, as a civilian leader with military experience, to be sure, but also with a deep appreciation and reverence for the prevailing wisdom of civilian control of our military. I recognize that being a member of the president’s cabinet requires a different perspective and unique responsibilities from a career in uniform, and I intend to keep this at the forefront of my mind. … relations grounded in meaningful civilian oversight. As Secretary of Defense, my priority will always, always be the men and women, military and civilian, who make up the department and their families. And I’ve seen what they’re capable of. Great Americans like your son sir, Beau, and also our future first lady, Dr. Biden in her tireless work for military families. As the President-elect said, Beau was one of the military lawyers on my staff in Iraq. And we stayed in touch and saw each other a few times after he returned home. And as you too can attest Madam Vice President-elect, Beau was a very special person and a true Patriot, and a good friend to all who knew him. Over the past four decades. I’ve witnessed our service members and civilians, selflessness and patriotism, and the extraordinary lengths that they will go to in support of the mission, and in support of one another. And I could not be more proud of them and their families. And if confirmed, it will be the honor of my lifetime to lead them again with honor and integrity. Thank you again Mr. President-elect and Madam Vice President-elect for this opportunity, and for your trust and confidence in me. May God bless and keep safe all those currently serving in harm’s way. And may God continue to bless the United States of America. Thank you. Good afternoon, President-elect Biden and I will take off as at a consequential moment for our country. Even as we work to contain this pandemic and responsibly open our economy, we also need to lead the Defense Department into the future, rebuild and renew global alliances and partnerships, and make sure the United States is prepared to address new threats and new challenges, from cyber to climate. The fundamental responsibility of our administration and any administration, is keeping the American people safe and secure. My whole career has been about keeping Americans safe. In the United States Senate I have served on the Homeland Security and Intelligence Committees. I’ve traveled to Iraq and Afghanistan and the Middle East, where I’ve seen the extraordinary training, commitment and heroism of our service members. And proudly represented California the state with the largest number of active duty military, and veterans in our country. And I am absolutely confident that General Lloyd Austin is the right person to lead the Department of Defense, at this critical moment. We need a proven leader to help address this pandemic. Someone with the experience to help make sure safe and effective vaccines are distributed equitably to all. A leader who will honor the service and sacrifice of those who wear the uniform of the United States. Provide for their wellbeing, and make sure they and their families are treated with the dignity and respect they have earned. And a leader who recognizes that our service members represent America around the world, and must uphold our nation’s highest values and ideals. General Austin is that leader. As the President-elect noted, this is a milestone nomination. A seasoned highly decorated and trail blazing commander. General Austin reflects the very best of our nation. And President-elect Biden and I will work closely with him, and our entire team of national security and foreign policy leaders, to make sure the United States of America is safer and more secure than ever before. Throughout America’s history, the United States military has been a home for generations of young men and women, dedicated to serving our country, and General Austin is among them. With this nomination, he will continue his service, strengthening not only America’s national security, but our role as a partner to allies around the world. And we couldn’t be more proud. Thank you. Mr President-elect are [crosstalk 00: 05:50]. When is the Attorney General nominee coming?"
"158","12-11-20"," Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our regular Friday afternoon briefing. I’m going to turn it over to you Yohannes in moment, who is going to give you all an update on our transition work. I will give you an update on the cabinet and then we will take your questions. Yohannes take it away. Great. Thanks Jen. And thanks everyone for making the time to be here. Let me start with a recap of the progress that we’re making in building out an administration that will be ready to serve the country on day one. The American people have made their voices clear. The nation needs a cabinet who’s competence, expertise and diversity across all dimensions match the moment we find ourselves in and the crises and challenges we have to face. We’ve only announced 14 of nearly two dozen cabinet level positions, but president-elect Biden’s commitment to assembling the most diverse, effective cabinet in history is already clear. It started with the selection of the first woman of South Asian descendant, the first black woman to be vice president and is continued on to his subsequent picks. This is group is battle-tested and experienced. They are thus far majority female, and majority people of color. Importantly, they are all ready to do the work with seriousness and expertise on day one. This group includes historic first, including some just named this week, such as the first African-American to lead the Department of Defense, the first Latino to lead the Department of Health and Human Services and the first Asian American and first woman of color to be named United States trade representative. Moving past the cabinet, our commitment to finding diverse expert talent applies to appointees in all positions and at all levels. Our team has been hard at work identifying candidates to serve as appointees to support our cabinet and sub cabinet. These appointees will be selected through a pre-inauguration process that is unprecedented in its rigor. Over these last months we have collected the names of thousands of highly qualified and aspiring public servants and rigorously analyzed and vetted them. Leading candidates will be invited to participate in multiple interviews before a robust selection process yields finalists, and ultimately administration appointees. Now as personnel, the transition continues to expand its engagement with outside groups, including beyond the public meetings with frontline workers, business and labor leaders and state and local elected officials that have been previously briefed. On a staff level, over 1000 stakeholders were reached this week alone, spanning organizations representing a range of constituencies and issue areas. Now, finally, I wanted to give an update on the agency review teams and their work. The teams continue making progress on our shortened timeline. And we have met some isolated delays, we continue to move forward in the vast majority of agencies. Classified briefings are happening across agencies, and we’re getting a more granular picture of the state of federal programs. On that note, I want to take a minute to thank the career staff at the agencies who have been extremely generous with their time and expertise throughout this process. Additionally, agency review teams have also conducted over 150 listening sessions with House and Senate congressional committee staff. Not only have these sessions been substantively informative, but they laid the groundwork for strong working relationships between the Hill and the incoming administration. Lastly, the HHS agency review team continues to meet with the Trump administration’s COVID response team, and we’re making progress in learning more about the response we will inherit in a few weeks. As members of our COVID advisory board have noted, we were at a critical time in the pandemic response, given the number of rising cases. And as you all know, the president-elect spoke about his priorities for his first 100 days related to the pandemic response. First, he will urge all Americans to wear masks for the first 100 days, which is the best thing each of us can do to protect ourselves and the people around us. He has also pledged to get at least 100 million COVID vaccines into the arms of American people in this timeframe. Finally, he spoken about the need to ensure that America school children can safely return to the classroom. We look forward to continuing the work across the agency review process to help prepare the incoming administration to be ready to serve the American people on day one. With that, I’ll turn it over to Jen. Thanks so much, Yohannes. so just to give you all a brief overview of the cabinet process and where we are, I know it’s been a flurry of activity this week. To date, we’ve announced 14 of the roughly two dozen cabinet nominees. And of course, there’ll be more coming in the weeks ahead. The team that we’ve put together has been a combination of experienced crisis tested leaders, many of whom have served in government previously, which the president elect and the vice president Alexia is invaluable at this time where we are confronting not just a global pandemic, but a recession where hundreds of thousands of Americans are out of work. And of course, crises involving the climate and other issues that need to be addressed immediately. But also, it’s important to them that we elevate and bring up new leadership as we bridge to the future. And that’s something that president-elect talked about when he was running for president. So I just want to highlight a couple of the people that he and the vice president-elect are particularly excited about. Wally Adeyemo, who has been nominated to serve as deputy treasury secretary, immigrated to the United States from Nigeria as a child. And he’s a son of a nurse and an elementary school principal, who taught him that the economy is supporting working families. He’s already been a trusted advisor in a time of crisis. Having served as deputy director of the National Economic Council, deputy national security advisor, and the first chief of staff of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. He’s younger than I am, so I will just note that. But very impressive already. Catherine Tai, who will be formally announced today, I should say, is deeply respected across the aisle and has spent her career working to level the playing field for American workers. She’s cast a bright new light on a new direction on trade that we need to be more strategic in how we trade in a way that makes us all stronger. Dr. Marcella Nunez Smith is among America’s foremost experts on persistent disparities in healthcare. She’s someone who was not known well, at least not known personally well by the president-elect and the vice president-elect before she was asked to serve as a co-chair of the task force, but she was so impressive in her work there, they knew that she needed to be a part of the administration, especially at this pivotal time when this disparities on healthcare is its own crisis in the country. Dr. Rochelle Walensky is the chief of infectious diseases at Massachusetts general hospital. And has been on the front lines of the COVID 19 pandemic response in Massachusetts. And then there are, of course, some names that have been around, but are young and in positions that will also be bridges to the future, including Jake Sullivan. He’s an experienced tested advisor to the president-elect, who served several national security roles throughout his career, both former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton. And of course, for a president-elect Biden, when he was the vice president. He is one of the youngest national security advisors in decades, and certainly recognizes that the national security challenges we’re facing today from the impact on the middle-class to climate change are different than they were just a few decades ago. And Brian Deese, who was just announced last week is already convening meetings about what to do on the economy, it’s the first ever time that a climate policy expert will be leading coordination of economic policy. And that certainly indicates a prioritization of that as an issue that’s not just economic, but it’s a crisis we’re facing. Finally, I just wanted to highlight a couple of the people we have recently announced given, there has been so many. Javier Bissera who, of course we announced as our nominee to serve as the secretary of Health and Human Services. He spent his career fighting for access to affordable healthcare. He was not only involved in of course, the passing of the Affordable Care Act, but he has been on the front lines of that fight as the attorney general of California. He’s also been leading on efforts to take on the tobacco use, opioids, mental health, and he will be covering all of those issues, of course, once he’s confirmed. And then secretary designate Austin who worked with the vice president Joe Biden to bring 150,000 troops home from Iraq. He’s somebody who has known the president-elect for more than a decade. They’ve sat in the situation room together, but also they’ve been in war zones together and have had conversations about a range of topics over the year. And again, he would be the first African-American to lead the department. He’s obviously also making an announcement today. I told you all last week, you have to eat your spinach and drink your coffee. So I hope you did all that to announce a number of additional members of our cabinet that get us to 14. So with that, I will stop there and let’s take some of your questions. Thanks. We’ll take our first question from Amy Wang. Hi Amy. Amy messaged. It looks like she’s having audio issues. So she messaged me her question, which I will read out loud. Sure. Sure. Well, I can start there. I will say that we’ve obviously had a flurry of announcements over the course of the last week. So as you all have been covering and living with us, once we get to January, our hope and expectation is that the dozens of meetings that have already occurred and the hundreds of engagements that have happened between our staff and the staff on the Hill will expand and lead into more meetings and hearings. And just to give you some sense of historical precedent, there are nominees who in the past have been confirmed right around Inauguration Day. And the crisis we are facing today require that kind of prioritization and that kind of bipartisan work to get qualified nominees in place, leading agencies to that they can work with the president-elect and the vice president-elect shortly after inauguration to address these crises. I’ll also just note that next week, as you all know, we are expected to hit certification and that fully confirms what we’ve known for weeks and what I think you all have been reporting for weeks, which is that president-elect Biden will be sworn in on January 20th. And that is a moment in our view where it should be a time where Republicans can move forward with expediting meetings with nominees and engagement with our team. This has already been happening behind the scenes, but to ensure we have the team in place leading these agencies as quickly as possible. Great. We’ll take our next question from Jessica Dean. Hi Jessica. We can hear you Jessica. We can’t hear you, Jessica, I should say. We can actually move on. Always can come back. Why don’t we move on to move on [inaudible 00:12:12]. Hi. Yeah. We can hear you. Thank you. Afternoon. So two quick questions. The first one is president-elect Biden recently told the New York Times that he wasn’t going to embark immediately on any big trade deals. And my question is, does that also include a US UK trade deal? And secondly, just very briefly, what’s his view on whether the Nord Stream 2 pipeline should go ahead or whether the Europeans should stop supporting that? Thank you. Sure. Thank you for your question. Well, I certainly would refer to the president-elect’s comments on that particular issue. Of course, we have just announced plans to nominate someone to lead USTR who is qualified and talented and well-respected by members of both parties. And I expect she will be engaged in those discussions as we determine the path forward. At this point in time, I haven’t had that discussion with the national security team and we also do our best to respect the one president at a time when it comes to international and foreign policy. If there’s anything we can give to you on that, we’ll circle back with you after the call. Great. I think we’re going to try to go back to Jessica Dean’s question, who I think has some audio issues. We can. Oh, wonderful. So sorry about that. Okay. Thanks so much for doing this. Well, I know Jessica, we’ve talked about this a little bit in the past couple of weeks. I don’t have anything new for you in terms of our plans. I will say that right now on the COVID front, we’ve obviously announced our team on Monday. It seems like it was several weeks ago, but it was just a few days ago. And our focus at this point in time is on how we can work of course, in coordination with career officials in the administration to determine the most efficient and effective and safe means of distributing the vaccine as soon as the president-elect and vice president-elect take office. We’re obviously planning for a range of broad scenarios, and we had a meeting as you know, some of our officials with the members of operation Warp Speed, we expect that engagement will certainly continue. But our focus at this point is really on what we can do to ensure that the vaccine is distributed, that it’s safe, that we are planning for all scenarios. We know this challenge is unprecedented in order to help the American people, but we don’t have anything more for you on the timing for the president-elect or how that would happen or whether it would be televised. Got it. And one quick follow-up on the vaccine distribution. I know the president-elect said last week, he had yet to see a detailed plan. Sure. It’s a great question. And we’re really in the information, or I should say our team is really in the information gathering stage. They’ve just been announced just a couple of days ago and they’re digging in deep immediately and having meetings and engagements, and I mentioned the meeting that you all know happened just yesterday and those will continue,. but I think at this point, we’re particularly focused on how we can get 100 million vaccines in people’s arms, I should say in 100 days, I sort of butchered that saying which is real well phrased normally. And we are focused on planning for all the scenarios. So, it’s early days, Jessica and we are engaging. We’re talking to members of the civil service, officials who have been in government. We’re obviously engaged with the companies who have been developing the vaccines, but at this point we’re in the information gathering stage. We’re planning for all scenarios and we just want to make sure we can do it as safely and effectively and efficiently as possible. Thanks so much. Great. We’ll take two more questions. We’ll next move on to Kevin [inaudible 00:16:36]. Hi, thanks for doing this guys. I was just wondering the congressional Asian Pacific Islander caucus today came out with this statement, specifically requesting that one of the remaining cabinet picks be Asian American or Pacific Islander. And basically I think that’s been the standard for, I think, administration side, going back two decades. I think I’ll sort of go back to where I started a couple of points. The president-elect and the vice president-elect are committed to building the most effective, most diverse cabinet in history. They’re well on their way to doing that, including in the APAC community, as it relates to our recent announcement of Catherine Tai at USTR and Neera Tanden in ONB. And I’ll just add that, we have not only the most qualified and experienced cabinet, but also we’re already on track to have the most diverse in American history. And that is a value that will continue to be important to the president-elect, to the vice president-elect and the entire team as further decisions are made. We’ll take our last question from Alice Holsteen. Hi, thank you so much. Just given the impending authorization of vaccine. Is there any more you can say about conversations with the outgoing administration on that? One of the taskforce members Zika Manuel said this morning in an interview that the team hasn’t been able to get adequate information about distribution plans. Well, I appreciate your question. And I would just say that we have begun engaging. We’ve been engaged on some level for a couple of weeks since ascertainment, but we are in the information gathering stage. And so I don’t want to get ahead of where we are now. Obviously we are eager to get access to as much information as possible and as quickly as possible. But regardless, we are addressing a pandemic where there is no playbook. This is a crisis where there is no model that we can build on. So our team of course wants access to as much information as they can gain. They have begun those discussions, they’re in touch with companies about vaccine distribution. They are doing a great deal of planning behind the scenes. Those will continue. But at this point, we’re information gathering. We’re determining where we need to scenario plan for ensuring that we are prepared as soon as the president-elect and the vice president-elect take office. All right. Well, thank you everybody for your time this afternoon. I’m sorry we were a few minutes late and we’ll look forward to engaging with all of you afterwards and in the weeks ahead."
"159","12-14-20"," Good evening, my fellow Americans. Over the past few weeks, officials in each state, commonwealth, and district, without regard to party or political preference have certified their winning candidate. Today, the members of the Electoral College representing the certified winner, cast their votes for President and Vice President of the United States in an act just as old as our nation itself. And once again in America, the rule of law, our Constitution and the will of the people prevailed. Our democracy pushed, tested, threatened, proved to be resilient, true and strong. The Electoral College votes which occurred today effect the fact that even in the face of a public health crisis unlike anything we’ve experienced in our lifetime, the people voted. They voted in record numbers. More Americans voted this year than have ever voted in the history of the United States of America. Over 155 million Americans were determined to have their voices heard and their votes counted. In the start of this pandemic, this crisis, many were wondering how many Americans would actually vote at all. But those fears proved to be unfounded. We saw something very few predicted, even thought possible, the biggest voter turnout in the history of the United States of America, a number so big that this election now ranks as the clearest demonstration of the true will of the American people, one of the most amazing demonstrations of civic duty we’ve ever seen in our country. It should be celebrated, not attacked. More than 81 million of those votes were casts for me and Vice President-elect Harris. That too is a record. More than any ticket has received in the history of America. It represents a winning margin of more than seven million votes over the number of votes cast for my opponent. Together, the Vice President-elect Harris and I earned 306 electoral votes, well exceeding the 270 electoral votes needed to secure victory. 306 electoral votes is the same number of electoral votes that Donald Trump and Vice President Pence received when they won in 2016, excuse me. At the time, President Trump calls the Electoral College tally a landslide. By his own standards. These numbers represented a clear victory then, and I respectfully suggest they do so now. If anyone didn’t know before, they know now. What beats deep in the hearts of the American people is this, democracy, the right to be heard, to have your vote counted, to choose leaders of this nation, to govern ourselves. In America, politicians don’t take power, people grant power to them. The flame of democracy was lit in this nation a long time ago. And we now know nothing, not even a pandemic or an abuse of power can extinguish that flame. And as the people kept it a flame, so too did courageous state and local officials, and election workers. American democracy works because America makes it work at a local level. One of the extraordinary things we saw this year was that every day Americans, our friends and our neighbors, often volunteers, Democrats, Republicans, Independents, demonstrating absolute courage, they showed a deep and unwavering faith in and a commitment to the law. They did their duty in the face of the pandemic. And then they could not and would not give credence to what they knew was not true. They knew this election was overseen, was overseen by them. It was honest, it was free and it was fair. They saw it with their own eyes and they wouldn’t be bullied into saying anything different. It was truly remarkable because so many of these patriotic Americans are subject to so much, enormous political pressure, verbal abuse, and even threats of physical violence. While we all wish that our fellow Americans in these positions will always show such courage and commitment to free and fair elections, it is my sincere hope we never again see anyone subjected to the kind of threats and abuse we saw in this election. It’s simply unconscionable. We owe these public servants a debt of gratitude. They didn’t seek the spotlight, and our democracy survived because of them, which is proof once more that it’s everyday America and infused with honor, character and decency that is the heart of this nation. You know, in this election, their integrity was matched by their strength, independence, and the integrity of our judicial system. In America, when questions are raised about the legitimacy of any election, those questions are resolved through the legal processes. And that’s precisely what happened here. The Trump campaign brought dozens and dozens and dozens of legal challenges to test the result. They were heard again and again, and each of the time they were heard, they were found to be without merit. Time and again, President Trump’s lawyers presented arguments to state officials, state legislatures, state and federal courts, and ultimately to the United States Supreme Court twice. They were heard by more than 80 judges across this country. And in every case, no cause or evidence was found to reverse or question or dispute the results. A few states went for recounts. All the counts were confirmed. The results in Georgia were counted three times. It didn’t change the outcome. The recount conducted Wisconsin actually saw our margin grow. The margin we had in Michigan was 14 times the margin President Trump won that state by four years ago. Our margin in Pennsylvania was nearly twice the size of the Trump margin four years ago. And yet none of this has stopped baseless claims about the legitimacy of the results. Even more stunning, 17 Republican Attorneys General, and 126 Republican members of the Congress, actually, they actually signed onto a lawsuit filed by the state of Texas. That lawsuit asked the United States Supreme Court to reject the certified vote counts in Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. This legal maneuver was an effort by elected officials and one group of states to try to get the Supreme Court to wipe out the votes of more than 20 million Americans in other states. And to hand the presidency to a candidate who lost the Electoral College, lost the popular vote, and lost each and every one of the states whose votes they were trying to reverse. It’s a position so extreme, we’ve never seen it before. And position that refused to respect the will of the people, refused to respect the rule of law, and refused to honor our Constitution. Thankfully, a unanimous Supreme Court immediately and completely rejected this effort. The Court sent a clear signal to President Trump that they would be no part of an unprecedented assault on our democracy. Every single avenue was made available to President Trump to contest the results. He took full advantage of each and every one of those avenues. President Trump was denied no course of action he wanted to take. He took his case to Republican governors and Republican Secretary of State as he criticized many of them, to Republican state legislature, to Republican appointed judges at every level. And then the case decided after the Supreme Court’s latest rejection, a judge appointed by President Trump wrote, “This court has allowed the plaintiff the chance to make his case and he has lost on the merits.” Lost on the merits. Even President Trump’s own cybersecurity chief, overseeing our elections, said it was the most secure election in American history, and summarily is let go. Let me say it again. His own cybersecurity chief overseeing this election said it was the most secure in American history. You know, respecting the will of the people is at the heart of our democracy, even we find those results hard to accept. But that’s the obligation of those who’ve taken on a sworn duty to uphold the Constitution. Four years ago, when I was a sitting Vice President of the United States, it was my responsibility to announce the tally of the Electoral College votes of the joint session of Congress, had voted to elect Donald Trump. I did my job. And I’m pleased but not surprised by the number of my former Republican colleagues in the Senate who have acknowledged already the results of the Electoral College. I thank them. And I’m convinced we can work together for the good of the nation on many subjects. That’s the duty owed to the people, to our Constitution, to our history. You know, in this battle for the soul of America, democracy prevailed. We the people voted, faith in our institutions held, the integrity of our elections remains intact. And now it’s time to turn the page as we’ve done throughout our history, to unite, to heal. As I said in this campaign, I will be president for all Americans. I’ll work just as hard for those of who you didn’t vote for me as I will for those who did. There’s urgent work in front of us. Getting this pandemic under control and getting the nation vaccinated against this virus, delivering immediate economic help so badly needed by so many Americans who are hurting today, and then building our economy back better than it ever was. In doing so, we need to work together to give each other a chance to lower the temperature. And most of all, we need to stand in solidarity as fellow Americans, to see each other, our pain, our struggles, our hopes, and our dreams. We’re a great nation. We’re good people. We may come from different places, hold different beliefs, but we share in common a love for this country, a belief in its limitless possibilities. For we, the United States of America, has always set the example for the world for a peaceful transition of power. We’ll do so again. I know the task before us won’t be easy. It’s tempered by the pain so many of us are feeling. Today, our nation passed a grim milestone, 300,000 deaths to this COVID virus. My heart goes out to each of you in this dark winter of the pandemic, about to spend the holidays and the new year with a black hole in your hearts, without the ones you loved at your side. My heart goes out to all of you who have fallen on hard times through no fault of your own, unable to sleep at night, staring at the ceiling, weighed down by the worry of what tomorrow will bring for you and equally important for your family. But we faced difficult times before in our history. I know we’ll get through this one, but together. That’s how we get through it together. So as we start the hard work to be done, may this moment give us a strength to rebuild this house of ours upon a rock that can never be washed away. As in the Prayer of St. Francis, for where there is discord, union, where there is doubt, faith where there is darkness, light. This is who we are as a nation. This is the America we love and that is the America we’re going to be. So thank you all and may God bless you. And may God protect our troops and all of those who stand watch over our democracy. Thank you. Thanks for the congratulations, appreciate it. Thank you."
"160","12-16-20"," Well, good afternoon by three minutes. Good to see you all. Over the past few weeks, Vice President-Elect Harris and I have been announcing nominees to our cabinet. They are people of the highest character, varied experiences and backgrounds who are going to help us beat this pandemic, keep us safe and secure, and build our economy back better than it ever was. They included long time colleagues, and new faces, a new voices. They include people who share my views, and those who have different views. They include people who supported my campaign from its earliest days, and people who ran against me. They’re experts in policy, leaders tested by crises, and by the end of this process, this cabinet will be the most representative of any cabinet in American history. We’ll have more people of color than any cabinet ever, we’ll have more women than any cabinet ever. We’ll have a cabinet of barrier breakers, a cabinet of firsts. I know how proud presidents are when they’re able to achieve a first in their cabinet. I remember when President Clinton named the first ever woman to be Secretary of State. I was there when President Obama named the first ever black Attorney General. But compared to my predecessors, the Harris-Biden cabinet is first among cabinets of all the firsts it represents. The first ever woman, the first black woman, the first woman with South Asian descent as vice-president, behind me on the screen, the first ever black Secretary of Defense, the first ever Latino head of the DHS, and the first ever Latino head of HHS. The first woman of South Asian American descent to lead OMB, the first woman and Asian American to lead the United States Trade Represent, as our lead United States trade representative. The first black woman to chair the President’s Council of Economic Advisers, the first ever woman to hold Alexander Hamilton’s position as Treasury Secretary. Our cabinet doesn’t just have one first, or just two of these firsts, but eight precedent-busting appointments. And today a nine, the first ever openly gay nominee to lead a cabinet department, and one of the youngest cabinet members ever. The Biden-Harris cabinet will be an historic cabinet, a cabinet that looks like America, a cabinet that taps into the best of America, a cabinet that is opening doors and breaking down barriers and accessing the full range of talent, we have so much of it, the full range of talent in this nation. A cabinet that is up to the immediate crises we face, and we face several. And the long-term challenges this nation faces in the future are in this cabinet’s hands. It’s a cabinet that’s battle-tested, qualified, experienced, creative, innovative, and forward-looking, and yes, representative. And today I’m proud to nominate its newest member, for Secretary of Transportation, I nominate Mayor Pete Buttigieg. I got to know Pete on the campaign trail. He’s one of the smartest people you’ll ever meet, and I’m one of the most humble; a mayor from the heartland, a management expert, a policy wonk with a big heart, a veteran, Lieutenant of the United States Navy Reserve, an intelligence officer, deployed to Afghanistan while he was mayor, a new voice with new ideas determined to move past old politics. The son of professors, his husband is an educator, always, always a mark of good character, that’s the way I look at it. And by the way, Jill and I have always enjoyed seeing Pete and Chasten together on the trail. Chasten has become a close friend of Jill’s and mine. And what I admire about Pete is he’s always clear about who he is, what he believes, and how he wants to bring people in, not exclude them. He’s able to walk into any room, and leave people inspired with his ability to describe an America that’s best for us, all of us, an America that’s hopeful, bold, creative, inclusive, an America that can do literally anything. The Department of Transportation services a critical mission, with a critical responsibilities, particularly in this administration. We need someone who knows how to work with state, local, and federal agencies. For example, right now, one in five miles of our highways are still in, “Poor condition,” according to the Society of American Engineers. Tens and tens of thousands of bridges are in disrepair, some on the verge of collapse, presenting a clear and present danger to people’s lives. We’re the world’s richest nation, but we rank 10th, we ranked 10th in overall quality of our infrastructure, according to the World Economic Forum. But there’s so much we can do. When I think of climate change, I think about jobs, good paying union jobs, jobs to put Americans to work making their air cleaner for our kids to breathe, restoring our crumbling roads, bridges, and ports, making it faster, cheaper, and cleaner to transport American-made goods across the country and around the world. I know that when you were mayor Pete, when people would come in to try to decide where they’re going to build something here, they’d say, “Where’s the nearest railroad head? What about the water access? What about,” and so on. This is going to attract businesses, jobs that lay the lines for the second great railroad revolution, which not only will slash pollution, will slash commute times, open up investments in areas connected to metropolitan areas for the first time. We selected Pete for transportation because the department is at the intersection of some of our most ambitious plans to build back better. When President Obama put me in charge of implementing the Recovery Act, which was over $800 billion, to take us from crisis, to recovery, to resurgence, modernizing our transportation infrastructure, our roads, bridges, and ports, were some of our most critical investments. We invested more in infrastructure than any time since President Eisenhower and the interstate highway projects. They’re projects that traditionally receive bipartisan support, that forge public and private partnerships. When we do those public and private partnerships, and we invest federal money, we pull billions of dollars of private investment for every dollar we put in, federal dollar. And then put millions of Americans to work, strengthening our economy, our economic competitiveness, and rebuilding our communities for the future. Pete’s got a great perspective of a mayor that solves problems and brings people together. He’s got a vision of a next generation leader, and with experience, and the temperament to lead change today, today. To dig us out of this economic crisis. For example, helping cities and states to keep transit systems running for frontline and essential workers, and then helping them modernize their airports, their ports, their railways, to attract and retain businesses and workers, to advance racial equality, racial equity, as we build back better include everyone. So zip code doesn’t determine your access to a good job, a good school, a good education, and healthcare. To deal with the existential threat of climate change with real jobs, not just $15 an hour job, which I’m going to call for universally, but for prevailing wages, union jobs paying $45, $50 an hour, and benefits. Helping cities across the country in red states and blue states, red cities, and blue cities, to build more climate resilient communities to deal with more extreme floods, droughts, and super storms. The West is burning. The Midwest is being flooded. The East Coast is being pummeled by more tornadoes and storms than it’s ever had. We’re in a state that’s three feet above sea level. All of us along the Atlantic Ocean find ourselves with problems in terms of flooding. Look, working with states, businesses, and labor to install 500,000 charging stations for the next generation of clean vehicles, smart grid system, reducing energy consumption, and ushering in a clean energy economy all across America. Some of you may remember I met with five leading CEOs in America, and five leading unions in America. And the president of General Motors, after our conversation, our joint conversation, picked up the phone and called, I’m told California and said they’re dropping their suit against California. They’re all in on making sure that we’re the first in the world to have, switch to, and be able to get to a carbon-neutral economic way to power automobiles as a consequence of dealing with electric vehicles. We can own the electric vehicle market. We can put, with those 500,000 charging stations, we can put a million jobs back in Detroit and in the Midwest, building cars. Pete’s going to also carry out the department’s duty to keep Americans safe on our roads, and our highways, and in our skies. Pete’s going to help build back better with jobs and hope, with vision and execution. And I’m honored, I’m honored he’s answering the call to serve his country once again. So please welcome, please welcome the next Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg. Okay, it’s all yours don’t [inaudible 00:10:06]. [inaudible 00:10:09]. Oh, you go it [inaudible 00:10:09]. Well, Mr. President-Elect Biden, madam Vice President-Elect, thank you so much for entrusting me with this opportunity to serve the American people. I am humbled by your confidence, eager to do everything in my power to ensure that this administration succeeds. My hometown, South Bend Indiana, was built by the power of American transportation, from trade along the river whose bend gives our city its name, to the rail lines that connected us to the rest of the country back when we were considered the West, to the livelihoods created by the good paying union jobs at places like the aeronautical supplier Bendix, and the giant auto assembly of Studebaker. And now climate and infrastructure innovation are helping bring my community into the 21st century. I’ve also had a personal love of transportation ever since childhood. More than once as a college student, I would convince a friend to travel nearly a thousand miles back to Indiana with me on Amtrak; though I know that in this administration, I will at best aspire to be the second biggest train enthusiast around. I spent a spring break in graduate school aboard a cargo ship studying there. Travel in my mind is synonymous with growth, with adventure, even love, so much so that I propose to my husband Chasten in an airport terminal. So don’t let anybody tell you that O’Hare isn’t romantic. And I want to take this chance to thank Chasten for everything that he gives, and everything that he sacrifices to support me in public service. The first time I ran for office was on a platform of supporting the Obama-Biden administration’s rescue of the auto industry. And when I did first take office as mayor in a city fighting its way out of the teeth of the great recession, infrastructure was at the heart of our vision. We re-imagined how vehicles and people move through the city, unlocking new economic vibrancy in our urban core. We built up partnerships from a regional collaboration to improve rail service, to the public-private partnership that put our city at the cutting edge of bicycle mobility. We developed new forms of support for lower wage workers in their commutes, and added electric vehicle charging infrastructure to help prepare for a more sustainable future. We also dealt with the challenges created by generations of often inadequate state and federal infrastructure funding. With just enough resources to replenish the paving of every lane mile of street in our city, only every 100 years or so, I faced a constant battle with that natural enemy of all mayors, the pothole. And in a community where more than a quarter of our residents lived in poverty, we worked to fill in the gaps that were created when underfunded transit resources left too many cut off from opportunity just because they didn’t have the means to own a car. At its best, transportation makes the American dream possible, getting people and goods to where they need to be, directly and indirectly creating good paying jobs. At its worst, misguided policies and missed opportunities can reinforce racial, economic, and environmental injustice, dividing or isolating neighborhoods, undermining government’s basic role to empower everyone to thrive. And now comes a historic opportunity. This administration can deliver policies and resources that will create jobs, rise to the climate challenge, and equitably serve all Americans, all while continuing to ensure the safety of travelers and workers alike. America has given this administration a mandate to build back better. And step one in building back better, literally, is to build. Americans so shouldn’t settle for less than our peers in the developed world when it comes to our roads and bridges, our railways, and transit systems. The US should lead the way. And I know that in this administration, we will. We’ll bring together leaders in communities from every corner, labor and business, left, right, and center, urban and rural, communities of color, tribal nations, mayors, counties, states, everyone who has a stake in American infrastructure, to design a better future. Americans expect us to see to it that the idea of an infrastructure week is associated with results, and never again a media punchline. My view of this opportunity is also shaped by being the youngest member so far named to this cabinet, and the first millennial invited to a seat at that table. Newer generations have a lot at stake in infrastructure policy, that by its nature must contemplate both the immediate and the longterm. The question of how America will look by the middle of this century, the competitiveness of our economy, the security of our climate, for me this isn’t academic, it’s personal. I’m also mindful that the eyes of history are on this appointment, knowing that this is the first time in American president has ever sent an openly LGBTQ cabinet member to the Senate for confirmation. I can remember watching the news, 17 years old in Indiana, seeing a story about an appointee of President Clinton named to be an ambassador, attacked and denied a vote in the Senate because he was gay, ultimately able to serve only by Recess Appointment. At the time, I had no aspirations of being appointed by a president to anything. At that age I was hoping to be an airline pilot. And I was a long way from coming out even to myself, but still I watched that story and I learned something about some of the limits that exist in this country when it comes to who is allowed to belong. But just as important, I saw how those limits could be challenged. So two decades later I can’t help but think of a 17-year-old somewhere who might be watching us right now, somebody who wonders whether and where they belong in the world, or even in their own family. And I’m thinking about the message that today’s announcement is sending to them. So thank you, Mr. President-Elect, thank you for honoring your commitment to diversity with this administration that you’re assembling. And thank you, Madam Vice President-Elect for your trailblazing leadership, your encouragement, and your friendship. There is no greater source of meaning in professional life than the chance to serve others. I felt that meaning every time I laced up my boots when I was in the military, every time I came to work when I was a mayor, and I feel it here now, joining this historic team with such an important mission, preparing to deliver for all Americans. Thank you. As President-Elect Biden and I look ahead to the challenges we will inherit upon walking into the White House, we are focused on containing this pandemic and delivering relief to all who need it. We are focused on safely reopening our schools, and responsibly reopening our economy. And as we’ve said many times, we are also focused on building America back better, and doing what is necessary to lift up all Americans, no matter where they live, whether it’s in big cities, rural areas, or any place in between. One of the most important ways we will do that is by creating good union jobs, to build, operate, and maintain a safe, modern, and sustainable transportation system. A transportation system that will help us grow our economy, tackle our climate crisis, and connect all Americans to jobs and opportunity. We will transform our roads and bridges, transit systems, railways, ports, and airports, while powering them with clean energy spark a renaissance in American passenger rail that will not only connect our country, but unlock job creation and growth across our manufacturing sector. And we will expand and upgrade our transportation system in a way that is equitable, serving communities of every size, urban and rural, across our country. The choice President-Elect Biden has made to help spearhead this work is simply outstanding. I got to know Pete over the last couple of years. We traveled to the same states, attended the same events, and shared a debate stage many times. We’ve had long conversations, he and I, about the future of our country, about the need for bipartisanship, and about family and faith. And along the way, Pete and his wonderful husband Chasten have become very dear friends of Doug’s and mine. Pete is an innovative problem solver. He has a sharp intellect, and a deep commitment to uniting people across party lines, and meeting our challenges together. He is a trailblazing leader from the industrial Midwest who understands we need to create opportunity for people of all backgrounds. And he is of course a veteran, and a dedicated public servant who represents the very best of our country, and the next generation of American leadership. Now, Pete will bring his remarkable talents to bear, not just on behalf of the people of South Bend, but on behalf of the people across our nation. In 1966, upon creating the Department of Transportation, President Lyndon Johnson said, “America’s history is a history of her transportation.” With Pete’s leadership, we are ready to write the next great chapter in that history, modernizing our infrastructure, creating jobs and opportunity, and helping to usher in a clean energy future for the United States of America. Thank you, Mr. President-Elect, and welcome Pete. Thank you, and by the way, I called the Vice President-Elect, and thanked her for not getting on the highway in the middle of the storm, a storm about to come up here. She wanted to be here for you, as you know. So thank you all very, very much. We’re working on that right now. I don’t want to get to the head of line, but I want to make sure that we demonstrate to the American people that it is safe to take. They’re working on that plan right now. And when I do it, I’ll do it publicly so you all can actually witness my getting it done. I’m confident. Talk on the stimulus package. The stimulus package is encouraging. It looks like they’re very, very close, and it looks like there’s going to be direct cash payments, but it’s a down payment, an important down payment on what’s going to have to be done beginning at the end of January, into February, but it’s very important to get done. I compliment the bi-partisan group on working together to get it done. Thank you all very much, and have a good day. [crosstalk 00:22:39] amending the Electoral College; would you agree with them?"
"161","12-18-20"," Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us this afternoon. I’m going to first kick it over to Yohannes to give us an overview of some of our work with the agencies through the agency review teams. I’ll give you a summary of where we are in the confirmations effort, as well as some events to look ahead to next week. With that, I’ll turn it over to Yohannes. Thanks, Jen, and thanks everybody for being on. I’m just going to give you a couple updates from the agency review process, starting with a few updates related to COVID-19. The transition’s COVID-19 advisory board continues to engage regularly with administration officials on the vaccine’s distribution and approvals. As multiple news outlets have reported, without urgent action this month by Congress to put sufficient resources into vaccine distribution and manufacturing, which the bi-partisan group is working on, there’s a real chance that after an early round of vaccinations the effort will slow and stall. Now we will also need additional action next year to fund the rest of our distribution efforts. Finally, we need the Trump administration to act now to purchase the doses it has negotiated with Pfizer and Moderna and to work swiftly to scale manufacturing for the US population and the world. As I mentioned, we’re also closely following the negotiations in Congress to renew a COVID-19 relief bill. While we’re encouraged by the bipartisan efforts in Congress, around 900 billion in economic relief, this package is only a start and we will need more action next year. We must focus significant resources on direct public health response to COVID-19. Now I know many of you have asked questions about recent reporting around DOD’s cooperation with the transition, so I just wanted to say a few words there. As we said last week in the briefing, our agency review teams continue making progress on a shortened timeline, and we’ve benefited from constructive cooperation within many departments and agencies, but we have met isolated resistance in some corners, including from political appointees within the Department of Defense. We were concerned to learn this week about an abrupt halt in the already limited cooperation there, and as indicated by DOD earlier today, we expect that decision will be reversed. An orderly cooperative transition is especially imperative in the national security and foreign policy realm due to classified and otherwise non-public information needed to do the job. No department is more pivotal to our national security than the Department of Defense, and a failure to work together could have consequences well beyond January. Again, an orderly and cooperative transition is especially imperative in our national security realm. And I do want to just take a minute and thank the DOD career professionals who have made valiant efforts to be helpful over the course of this process. With that, I’ll turn it over to Jen. Thanks so much, Yohannes. Let me give you a little bit of a preview of next week. On Monday, President-elect Joe Biden and Dr. Jill Biden will receive the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine in Delaware and they’ll also think healthcare workers at the facility. We’ll have more details on the specifics of when and where on Monday, but obviously we want to make sure we are not creating chaos around where he’ll be getting it done; but he will be doing it in public, which is important to us, as he stated many times to send a clear message to the public that it is safe. Consistent with security and medical protocols, the vice president-elect will not receive the vaccine at the same time as the president. We expect she and Mr. Emhoff will receive their first dose of the vaccine the following week, and we will have additional details on that next week. We had another big week announcing additional nominations for the Cabinet, including some historic firsts, including the first Native American interior secretary and the first-ever Native American Cabinet secretary with representative Deb Haaland; first openly gay person to lead a Cabinet department in our nation’s history, Mayor Pete Buttigieg for the Department of Transportation; and the first African-American man to serve as EPA administrator, to be nominated to serve as. We’ve now rolled out 19 out of roughly two dozen Cabinet-level positions, and it continues to be the most diverse Cabinet in history while also being one of the most qualified and crisis-tested, given the challenges we’ll be facing when President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Harris are, take the oath of office, I should say, on January 20th. With leaders in both parties now preparing for President-elect Joe Biden to be sworn in on January 20th, we also just wanted to note that some confirmation hearings have been set, but we are looking ahead to moving the process forward in January. We expect Democrats and Republicans will be eager to confirm qualified nominees who will be helping to lead agencies that will address the crisis we’re facing from the pandemic to the economic crisis, to even rebuilding our relationships in the world. Just to give you a point of reference: In 2017, 19 of Donald Trump’s nominees received their hearings on, or before inauguration day, and in 2009, 25 of Barack Obama’s nominees received their hearings before inauguration day. We certainly understand this year is different, for a range of reasons, but we are eager and hopeful that we will be able to work with members from both sides and their teams to get our nominees confirmed. This week, nominees had more than a hundred meetings with members of Congress of both parties to discuss their nominations. Nominees also joined meetings with a range of outside groups and participated in public events to build support for their nominations, including treasury secretary and deputy treasury secretary nominees, Janet Yellen and Adewale Adeyemo, met with groups that advocate for racial and economic justice. HHS secretary nominee, Xavier Becerra, participated in a Politico Live event about disparities in healthcare. Racial equity taskforce co-chair, Marcella Nunez-Smith, participated in NAACP Town Hall on COVID, and CA chair, Cecilia Rouse, met with African-American women leaders. We will have more of that in the coming weeks. It’s important for us to have the nominees and team out there as much as possible so the American people can get to know them even in advance of their confirmations. Today, in addition to the Cabinet announcements this week, we announced additional members of our White House communications and press teams. We’ll have, of course, more members to announce in the weeks ahead, leading up to the inauguration. But I’ll just note since part of them is our team, from the beginning, President-elect Biden has made clear our team should look like the country. This team is not only built from the men and women who worked their tails off electing Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, it will also be the most diverse press and communications team in history. We’ll have more to report on our teams and many other teams and White House personnel in the weeks ahead. We’ll be announcing with the goal of announcing 100 White House staff by the end of the year. The last thing I’ll say about next week is that you should expect President-elect Joe Biden in the next weeks will have additional announcements about his Cabinet. I can’t give you an exact timeline on that because of course decisions need to be made, and we want to give him the space and time to do that. He’ll also be taking a few days off to spend time with his immediate family. As he said on a Stephen Colbert’s show last night, like millions of Americans, his Christmas will look very different this year. We’re asking families across the country to stay at home and limit their travel, and the President-elect will stay at home in Delaware with Dr. Biden and they’ll forego their traditional larger family gathering. With that, we’re happy to take your question. Great. With that, we will take our first question from Alice Olsen. Thank you so much. Sure. Alice, thank you so much for your question. There was no change in the timing of the president-elect’s vaccination. We, of course, have been relying on the advice of Dr. Fauci and the medical experts, and that was the time that worked best for him to accomplish that. I would say on Congressman Cedric Richmond, as you may have seen in the statement we put out last night, he was not in close contact with the president-elect, as it’s defined by the CDC. His interactions were in open-air settings, masked and did not total a cumulative of more than 15 minutes. We’ve completed contact tracing, and it was determined that no additional staff were in close contact with Congressman Richmond and need to quarantine. As you also know, the president-elect is tested regularly. We put that information out regularly and consistently, and we will to do that in the days ahead. For us, we will continue to be transparent. We have COVID protocols in place that everybody abides by who has any contact or attends any event with the president-elect or meeting. We will continue those and we will continue to be as transparent as possible as quickly as possible as we were when we learned of the congressman’s diagnosis. Well, certainly getting the pandemic under control is front and first and foremost, the top priority for the incoming administration. We see every day, the thousands of people who are being impacted, that’s why our protocols are so serious and taken so seriously by every member of the president-elect’s team. As anyone who knows, who has attended an event as a part of the pool, every reporter is masked, every person in the building is masked. There are testing requirements. I would just say that we will continue to abide by those. We will continue to do contact tracing in every scenario that arises, and we will continue to provide transparent information. That’s been our consistent approach all along, and that’s what you can expect in the weeks ahead. Thanks. Our next question will come from Annie Karni. Hi there. I just had a question. I wondered if you could clarify why President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Harris are staggering their vaccinations? I hadn’t heard anything about vaccinations. I actually quoted a doctor in a story who said it would have been great to see Pence and Trump doing it together today. Obviously that didn’t happen, but can you explain that? I wasn’t aware that there was some security or health reason to stagger. Sure, Annie. It’s a great question. Thanks for asking it. We of course abide by the recommendations of our medical experts and health experts, and their recommendation was that they do it separately. As I noted, the vice president-elect will be getting the first dose of her vaccine the week after Christmas, so it will be happening quickly. That’s another opportunity, of course. This is not the reasoning, but I will just state that it is another opportunity for us to reiterate to the American public that it is safe and important for people to abide by when a vaccine becomes available even more broadly. But it is based on recommendations that the only reason, the primary reason, is based on a recommendation by our medical and health experts. That they should do not do doses at the same time. I’m not going to go into more details than that, but it is the recommendation that they did it separately and that they stagger the first doses. Great. Hi. Thanks so much for doing this, you guys. I appreciate it. Just sort of following up a little bit on the Richmond diagnosis. Jen, you had mentioned that the protocols are such that there’s not a concern about the president-elect’s health, but can you detail, excuse me, exactly what those protocols are? I mean, I’m quite familiar obviously with what the media’s protocols are, but is there any sort of requirement that people who are in contact with the vice president or the president-elect, excuse me, have COVID testing the same way that media does? If you could go through that, that would be helpful. Then I have a second question about just what you’re planning when you do start working in the West Wing. If staff will have to have a vaccine in order to occupy offices there, or are you guys going to have some kind of Zoom administration? If you can sort of outline your planning on that, I’d appreciate it. Sure. A Zoom administration is very 2020. I don’t think I’d heard of Zoom until pre-COVID, but right around the start of COVID. I will say that, as you know and anyone who’s attended an event knows, there’s a requirement to have two negative tests even to be in that facility in the building and at the time of an event. Staff are held to the standard of having N95 masks, of also having multiple negative tests, of quarantining and holding ourselves to strict standards about who we interact with. I’ve only interacted with members of my immediate family and close bubble. I think that is true of many members of the president elect’s incoming team. I haven’t even been to Delaware in a few weeks, so I would say that there are stringent standards and expectations. It’s, of course, to keep everybody safe, including of course the president-elect and the vice president-elect, but all of the staff, all of you, but also it’s to be a model to the American people. There’s a lot being asked of the American people right now: To wear masks, to, of course, abide by strict protocols, to not be a part of large family gatherings. And we’re expected to do the same. I don’t have more details other than to say that it is conveyed to us regularly and frequently that we are to abide by strict protocols and to be, to the best of our ability, models to the American people, given what we’re asking at this difficult moment in our history. Oh, sorry. That was a great question too. We don’t have more information for you at this time. I think we expect that everybody who would traditionally be and historically be working out of the West Wing probably will not be working out of the West Wing on January 20th and January 21st. We’re waiting for and will abide by the guidance and direction by our medical experts and doctors. I expect we’ll have more on that in January. We can circle back with you after the briefing. Obviously, everybody, including of course Congressman Richmond, abides by the same protocols. But we’ll circle back with you if we have more information on that post-briefing. Thank you. We will take our next question from Jeff Zeleny. Hey, guys. The acting secretary of defense, Chris Miller, said this morning that meetings with your transition team at the Pentagon will take a holiday pause. He said there was an agreed upon two-week break between the two transition teams, so that is one of the reasons why there seem to have been a breakdown in [inaudible 00:19:31] meetings. Thank you for the question. Let me be clear, there was no mutually agreed upon holiday break. In fact, we think it’s important that briefings and other engagements continue during this period as there’s no time to spare, and that’s particularly true in the aftermath of the ascertainment delay. There was no mutually agreed upon holiday break. In terms of when meetings will resume, meetings and requests for information which are substantively interchangeable, it’s our hope and expectation that that will happen immediately, and that we will be able to have access to, and our agency review teams, we’ll be able to have access to the sort of information that is invaluable in terms of keeping the homeland safe and all the other myriad of responsibilities that fall under DOD’s purview. All right. Thanks, Yohannes. Our agency review teams yesterday were informed. I don’t know what the exact transmission mechanism was, but they were informed yesterday that meetings were being pulled down and they immediately and appropriately escalated it. I’d go back to what I said at the top, which is to say there have been many agencies and departments that have facilitated the exchange of information and meetings over the past few weeks since the ascertainment. There have been pockets of recalcitrance, and DOD is one of them. I don’t have anything to share with you on that today other than to say it’s our hope and expectation across the board, given the challenges that the country faces, is that all of the agency review teams be given access to the information that they need to the job that they needed to do for the American people. If I could ask just one quick follow-up of Jen, sorry. Well, Jeff, as you know, as I started with, we have announced the majority of the Cabinet, but there are still a number of important roles to be announced. It’s all based on when decision-making is made and we want to give him the time and space to do that. I will say there certainly I would expect there could be more next week, but certainly more following. It just depends on decisions over the coming days. We’ll take our last question from Yamiche Alcindor. … so much for taking my question and thanks so much for doing this briefing. I want to get back to what Yohannes was just talking about when it comes to there was no mutually agreed upon holiday break. That is of course in direct contrast to what Acting Secretary Miller is saying. I don’t think we need to communicate that. I think you can make your own judgements, Yamiche, about the information we provided. It’s not in our interest to provide inaccurate information about the status of our engagements. Our preference here is to just continue our work through the agency review teams, through our experts, and many of them we’ve brought back in who have decades of experience, to work on these issues leading up to January 20th. Our preference is certainly for things to proceed as usual, and that’s our hope. And then on that, just building from DOD, because I had another question about Russia hacks, but on kind of the operation that you’re getting, it’s my understanding that cooperation has been uneven. Can you give us examples of what you’re getting and what you’re not getting and how the White House has tried to resolve that? I’m hearing there might be other holdups in other agencies. I don’t have anything else to share there other than to say, as I said before, there have been many agencies and departments that have been willing participants in a smooth transition; but there, as I said before, there have been in places like DOD that have been less cooperative, as we’ve seen over the last 48 hours. Just to be clear, as Yohannes said in the beginning, the career officials at the Department of Defense have been cooperative and helpful and we’ve been working with throughout this process. This is more of an isolated issue with a limited number of political appointees. As the president-elect said yesterday, there’s still a lot we don’t know about the breach, but what we do know is a matter of great concern. Our teams have been briefed by some of the career public servants who are working around the clock to respond, and we’re grateful for their efforts. The president-elect also issued a warning to our adversaries who would attack us with malicious cyber operations: There will be substantial costs. The administration will reserve the right to respond at a time and in a manner of our choosing, often in close coordination with our allies and partners. While our adversaries shouldn’t expect us to telegraph our punches, they should expect that the president-elect is a man of his word. Thanks, everyone. Have a great weekend. We’ll try not to keep you too busy."
"162","12-19-20"," … of our time, climate change. Excuse me. Like their fellow Cabinet nominees and appointees, members of our environmental and energy team are brilliant. They’re qualified, tested, and they are barrier-busting. Today, the announcement we will make is the sixth of African-American members of our Cabinet, which is a record. After today, our Cabinet won’t just have one or two precedent-breaking appointments, but 12, including today’s long overdue appointment of the first Native American Cabinet Secretary. And welcome. Welcome. Welcome. Thanks for being willing to do this. Already, there are more people of color in our Cabinet than any Cabinet ever, more women than ever. The Biden-Harris Cabinet, it will be historic, a Cabinet that looks like America, that taps into the best of America, that opens doors and includes the full range of talents we have in this nation. And like the rest of the team today’s nominees are ready on day one, which is essential because we literally have no time to waste. Just this year, wildfires burned more than five million acres in California and Washington state. Across the West, an area roughly the size of the entire state of New Jersey literally burned to the ground. Intense and powerful hurricanes, tropical storms pummeled Florida, Louisiana, North Carolina, across the Gulf, and along the East Coast. Record floods, hurricane-speed windstorms, and severe droughts ravaged the Midwest, and more Americans see and feel the devastation in big cities, small towns, on coastlines and in farmlands, and red states and in blue. Look, billions of dollars in damage, homes and memories washed away, small businesses closed for good, crops and farmlands destroyed for the next generation of family farmers, and just last year, the defense department reported that climate change is a direct threat to more than two thirds of our military operational critical installations in the world, particularly in the United States. And this could well be a conservative estimate. And so many climate and health calamities are colliding all at once. It’s not just a pandemic that keeps people inside. It’s poor air quality. Multiple studies have shown air pollution is associated with the increased risk of death from COVID-19. Folks, we’re in a crisis. Just like we need to be a unified nation in response to COVID-19, we need a unified national response to climate change. We need to meet the moment with the urgency it demands as you would during national emergency. And from this crisis, from these crises, I should say, we need to seize the opportunity to build back and build back better than we were before. That’s what this administration is going to do with the help of these fine people. When we think about climate change, we think jobs, good-paying union jobs. A key plank of our Build Back Better economy and economic plan is building a modern, climate-resistant infrastructure and a clean energy future. We can put millions of Americans to work, modernizing water, transportation, and energy infrastructure to withstand the impacts of extreme weather. When we think about renewable energy, we see American manufacturers, American workers racing to lead the global market. We see farmers making agriculture first in the world to achieve net-zero emissions and gaining new sources of income in the process on the farm. And we see small businesses and master electricians designing and installing innovative, energy-conserving buildings and homes. We’re going to reduce electric consumption and save hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in energy costs. And we will challenge everyone, everyone to step up. And we’ll bring America back, back into the Paris Agreement, and put us back in the business of leading the world on climate change again. The current administration reversed the Obama-Biden fuel-efficiency standards and picked Big Oil companies over American workers. Our administration will not only bring those standards back. We’ll set new, ambitious standards that our workers are ready to meet today. We see American workers building and installing over 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations across this country. We see American consumers switching to electrical vehicles through rebates and incentives. And not only that, the federal government owns a maintains an enormous fleet of vehicles. We’re going to harness the purchasing power of our federal government to make sure we’re buying clean electric vehicles that are made and sourced by union workers right here in America. Altogether, this will mean one million, one million new jobs in the American auto industry. And we’ll do another big thing, put us on a path of achieving a carbon- pollution-free electric sector by the year 2035 that no future president can turn back. Transforming the American electric sector to produce power without carbon pollution will be the greatest spur to job creation and economic competitiveness in the 21st century, not to mention the benefits to our health and our environment. But we need to get to work. We got to get to work right away. We’ll need scientists at national labs, land-grant universities, historic Black colleges and universities to innovate the technologies needed to generate, store, and transmit this clean energy. We’ll need engineers to design them, workers to manufacture them. We’ll need iron workers and welders to install them. That’s how we’re going to become the world’s largest exporter of these technologies, creating even more jobs. We know how to do this. The Obama-Biden administration reduced the auto industry and … [inaudible 00:06:31] rescued the automobile industry while reducing pollution and, at the same time, helped them retool. We made solar cost competitive with traditional energy, weatherized more than a million homes. Recovery Act made record clean energy investments, $90 billion, on everything from smart grid systems to clean energy manufacturing, and we’re going to do it again, but this time bigger, faster, and better than before. We’re also going to build 1.5 million new energy-efficient homes and public housing units that will benefit our communities three times over by alleviating the affordable housing crisis, by increasing energy efficiency, and by reducing the racial wealth gap linked to home ownership. We’re going to create more than a quarter-million jobs right away to do things like working toward plugging the 3,200,000 abandoned oil and gas Wells that the EPA says pose an ongoing threat to the health and safety of our communities. They’re going to be good-paying union jobs doing that. We’re going to launch a new, modern-day Civilian Climate Corps to heal our public lands and make us less vulnerable to wildfires and floods. And I believe that every American has a fundamental right to breathe clean air and drink clean water. I know that we haven’t fulfilled that right. No, we haven’t fulfilled that right for a generation or more in places like Cancer Alley in Louisiana or right here in my state along Route 9, the Delaware Corridor. Fulfilling this basic obligation to all Americans, especially low-income white, Black, brown, and Native American communities who too often don’t have the clean air and clean water … It’s not going to be easy, but it’s absolutely necessary. And we are committed to facing climate change by delivering environmental justice. These aren’t pie-in-the-sky dreams. These are concrete, actionable solutions, and the team’s going to get it done. For the Secretary of the Interior, I nominate Congresswoman Deb Haaland. She’s of the Pueblo people, only 35 generations in New Mexico, and she’s from a military family. Her mom, also Pueblo, served in the United States Navy. Her dad, a Norwegian American and Marine, now buried in Arlington. A single mom, she raised her child while running a small business. When times were tough, they relied on food stamps. Congresswoman Haaland graduated from law school and then got involved in politics, public life. Two years ago, she became one of the first Native American women to serve in the United States Congress. She serves on the Armed Service Committee and the Committee on Natural Resources and chairs the subcommittee on National Parks, Forests, and Public Lands, which I have an incredibly sincere interest in. Where she learned, she learned and she earned the respect of a broad coalition of people from tribal leaders to environmental groups to labor. As the first Native American Cabinet Secretary in the history of United States of America, she’ll be a true steward of our national parks, our natural resources, and all of our lands. The federal government has long broken promises to Native American tribes, who’ve been on this land since time immemorial. With her appointment, Congresswoman Haaland will help me strengthen the nation-to-nation relationship, and I’m honored to accept … She’s been willing when I called her to accept this critical role. Again, Deb, thank you for doing this. For Secretary of Energy, I nominate Governor Jennifer Granholm, first woman … Where is Jennifer? Back there. She’s a great friend as well … first woman ever to serve as governor of Michigan. In 2009, she faced the collapse of the defining industry of her state and our nation, but I saw firsthand how she responded. She bet on the auto workers. She bet on the promise of a clean energy future. Her leadership helped rescue the automobile industry in the United States of America, helped save a million American jobs. It helped bring Detroit back. Governor Granholm is just like the state she’s led so efficiently and effectively for eight years, hard-working, resilient, and forward-thinking, someone not only capable of solving urgent problems, but someone who sees the opportunities of the future, and always, always with her eyes on the needs and aspirations of working people. We’ve become friends over time together throughout her career. She’s worked with states, cities, business, and labor to promote clean energy future with new jobs, new industry, cleaner and more affordable energy. Now I am asking her to bring that vision and faith in America to the Department of Energy. Thank you [inaudible 00:11:45]. I appreciate it a bunch. For Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, I nominate Michael Regan. Michael is a proud son of North Carolina. He turned a passion for exploring the woods and waters and Inner Coastal Plain into a deep expertise in environmental science. He got his start at the EPA serving with both Democrat and Republican administrations, working in everything from reducing air pollution to improving energy efficiency. He currently serves as Secretary of North Carolina’s Department of Environmental Quality. When the governor told me how wonderful he was, I don’t think he expected that I was going to try to steal him, but Governor, thank you very much for putting up with me. But in Environmental Quality, he’s brought to the people across the public and private and nonprofit sectors to help build new clean energy economy, creating quality jobs and confronting climate change. He led the charge to clean up the Cape Fear River, contaminated for years by dangerous toxic chemicals. He created North Carolina’s first board of its kind to address environmental justice and equality and equity. It helps lift up frontline and fenceline communities. They’re those communities that live along … that literally have fences separating them from the plants that are polluting, chemical and other plants that are polluting … helps lift up those frontline and fenceline communities who carried the burdens of industrial progress for much too long without sharing in any of the benefits. Michael would be the second African-American official and the first African-American man to serve in this position. He shares my belief in forming consensus and finding common purpose. He’s a leader who will respect the EPA’s place as the world’s premier environmental protection agency and reassert that as the world premier agency that safeguards our entire planet, protects our lives, and strengthens our economy for all Americans. An accomplished public servant, brilliant environmental lawyer, daughter of a working class family who has dedicated her life to solving the most complex environmental challenges facing America. She’s served in both Democratic and Republican administrations, helping safeguard our public lands, helping communities manage the natural resources responsibilities. Chairman of the CEO, Council of Economic Quality, I’m asking her to coordinate our environmental efforts across the entire federal government to solve some of the most persistent environmental problems America faces today. Brenda would be the first African-American official to hold this critical position. We are fortunate that one of the most widely respected environmental leaders in the country accepted the call to serve again. Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. To serve as the first ever national climate advisor. By the way, when we were in the back, we were talking about the environment, and I turned and said that this particular person’s forgotten more about the environment than most people know. I wasn’t sure she was going to do it, but the first ever national climate advisor to lead the newly formed White House Office of Domestic Policy, I’m appointing Gina McCarthy. Gina was the former EPA administrator. In this role she led the office. It shows how serious I am to ask her to come back, and it shows how committed she is to be willing to come back. Gina has got more than 20 years of experience, and she’s a policy wonk and a people person, a problem solver, and a coalition builder. As EPA administrator, she was instrumental in carrying out the Obama Biden climate action plan, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, getting toxins out of the air we breathe, conserving critical water sources. She led our effort to help lower carbon emissions of existing power plants and power plants in the future. We’re doing the necessary work here at home. She helped us rally the world around the Paris Climate Accords. Today, I’m asking her to take a singular focus on carrying out the ambitious climate agenda here at home and working with my special envoy, former secretary of state John Kerry, who leads our climate effort around the world. I’m grateful that she agreed to do it. I’m looking forward to working alongside her again. To serve as our national climate advisor, I appoint Ali Zandi … Zaidi, excuse me. Ali, you can call me Bidden. If I mispronounced your last name. I apologize. He served as a top climate advisor to president Obama and me in the office with managing the budget and the domestic policy council. He helped draft and implement our climate action plan and secure the Paris Climate Agreement. He currently serves as New York deputy secretary of energy and environment and the state’s chairman of climate policy and finance. He’s helping to create jobs generating solar and wind power, jobs building electric charging stations, and a more modern grid of bold climate action grounded in science, economic and public health. He’s an immigrant from Pakistan who grew up in the rust belt outside of Erie, Pennsylvania. I was from the better part of the state in Northeast, the Scranton and Pittsburgh area. All kidding aside, he knows we can beat climate crisis and we can do it with jobs. He knows we can deliver environmental justice and revitalize communities as well, too often overlooked and forgotten, and every day, he’ll walk into the White House knowing the world is looking for America to lead. I say to each one of you, thank you for answering the call, and thank you to your families. We could not do this without them. We couldn’t do it without you. To the career civil servants at the agencies, I know many of you have felt forgotten for a long time. We look forward to working with you, to once again carrying out your department’s mission and honoring the integrity of the offices in the organization you’re involved with. To the American people, yes, the goals I’ve laid out are bold, the challenges ahead are daunting, but I want you to know that we can do this. We must do this, and we will do this. We are America. There’s nothing we can’t do when we do it together. So I say again to all of you, God bless you all, may God protect our troops, and now I’m going to turn this to the team, starting with our next Secretary of the Interior, congresswomen Deb Haaland. Thank you. Thank you. I’m proud to stand here on the ancestral homelands of the Lenape tribal nation. The President-elect and vice president-elect are committed to a diverse cabinet, and I’m honored and humbled to accept their nomination for Secretary of the Interior. Growing up in my mother’s pueblo household made me fierce. My life has not been easy. I struggled with homelessness. I relied on food stamps and raised my child as a single mom. These struggles give me perspectives, though, so that I can help people to succeed. My grandparents, who were taken away from their families as children and sent to boarding school in an effort to destroy their traditions and identities, maintained our culture. This moment is profound when we consider the fact that a former secretary of the interior once proclaimed his goal to “civilize or exterminate us.” I’m a living testament to the failure of that horrific ideology. I also stand on the shoulders of my ancestors and all the people who have sacrificed so that I can be here. My dad was a U.S. Marine, and no matter where we were stationed, he made sure we spent time outdoors. Time with my dad in the mountains or on the beach and time with my grandparents in the cornfield at Laguna taught me to respect the earth and to value our resources. I carry those values with me everywhere. I’m a product of their resilience. As our country faces the impacts of climate change and environmental injustice, the interior department has a role to address these challenges, the President-elect’s goals, driven by justice and empowering communities who have shouldered the burdens of environmental negligence, and we will ensure that the decisions at interior will once again be driven by science. We know that climate change can only be solved with participation of every department and of every community. Coming together in a common purpose, this country can and will tackle this challenge. The President-elect and vice president-elect know that issues under interior’s jurisdiction aren’t simply about conservation. They’re woven in with justice, good jobs and closing the racial, wealth and health gaps. This historic moment will not go by without the acknowledgement of the many people who have believed in me over the years and had the confidence in me for this position. I’ll be fierce for all of us, for our planet and all of our protective land, and I’m honored and ready to serve. Thank you again. Mr. President-elect, Madam vice president elect, thank you for your confidence. I bring my gratitude and that of the loves of my life, my husband and best friend and partner, Dan Mulhern, my glorious children and their equally magnificent spouses, Connor and Alexis, Cece and Dameon, and Jack. My commitment to clean energy was forged in the fire. I was the governor of Michigan, as the President-elect said, during the great recession, when it struck and pushed our auto industry, which is the lifeblood of Michigan, to the brink of utter collapse. Workers were losing their jobs through no fault of their own, banks wouldn’t lend, people were losing their houses. Our unemployment rate in Michigan was 15%, in Detroit it was 28%, but then, thankfully, as now, help was on the way. Joe Biden and the Obama administration worked with us to rescue the auto industry and the million jobs that are attached to it. They worked with us to retool and electrify Detroit for the future, of course, and to diversify Michigan’s economy on the premise of this promising future in clean energy. So today, in the midst of another harrowing crisis, clean energy remains among the most promising jobs and economic growth sector in the world. Over the next two decades, countries and companies are going to invest trillions, trillions, not just billions, trillions in electric cars and batteries and wind turbines and solar panels and energy efficient appliances and energy efficient buildings. They’re going to upgrade their electric grids using smart technology. The path to building back better starts with building and, and deploying those products here, stamping them “Made in America,” and exporting them around the world. We can win those jobs for American workers with the right policy. We can, and I know what those jobs will mean for both the planet and for those workers and families. I’m proud to have been a U.S. citizen now for 40 years, but I arrived here as a Canadian immigrant at age four, brought by parents seeking opportunity. My mom is a funny and fierce Irish Welsh Newfie, born in Newfoundland, which is a Canadian province off the East coast, a fishing province they called the Rock, and like many women in her generation, she didn’t go to college. She married a great man, my dad, who passed away earlier this year of a cerebral hemorrhage. My dad was born in rural Canada, in a log cabin with no running water, into extreme poverty. His father, my grandfather, immigrated to Canada from Sweden, during the Great Depression, again, seeking opportunity, but when my grandfather could not find a job to support his young family, in desperation, my grandfather shot himself, leaving my grandmother and three young children in dire poverty. My father was three years old when that happened, and when he was 11, my dad found work at a saw mill, and he never stopped working. Working gentle father got the fair chance that he was looking for in America. He had started out as a bank teller and he retired as head of the bank. And it’s because of my family’s journey and my experience in fighting for hardworking Michigan families that I have become obsessed, obsessed with creating good paying jobs in America, in a global economy, obsessed with seizing the opportunities that a clean energy future will provide for American workers. So we can stand on the sidelines and let other countries beat us to these opportunities, or we can get in the game. And I am so ready and honored, coach, that you are putting me on the field with this amazing team to help create those jobs in every pocket of this country and especially in the hardest hit places and for the people who are still waiting on the fair chance that they need. Thank you for tapping me to work on their behalf. Mr. President Elect, Madam Vice president Elect, thank you for this opportunity. Growing up as a child, hunting and fishing with my father and grandfather in eastern North Carolina, I developed a deep love and respect for the outdoors and our natural resources, but I also experienced respiratory issues that required me to use an inhaler on days when pollutants and allergens were especially bad. I’ve always been curious about the connections between our environment and our health, how the world around us contributes to or detracts from our enjoyment of life. So after completing my education in environmental science, there was one place in particular that I wanted to work, the EPA. When I started that first summer internship, I never imagined that one day I would be nominated to lead an agency as its administrator. So this opportunity, well, it’s a dream come true. Since the start of my career, my goals have been the same, to safeguard our natural resources, to improve the quality of our air and our water, to our families and our communities, And to help them seize the opportunities of a cleaner, healthier world. Now I’m honored to pursue those goals alongside leaders who understand what’s at stake. When president elect Biden called out the plight of the fence line communities during the campaign, he made it clear that we would no longer just deal with the issues up to the fence line of these facilities, but that we would actually see the people on the other side of those fence lines. He’s already backed up that commitment by assembling a team that reflects America. And I’m proud to join the vice-president elect as a fellow HBCU graduate in this administration. Together this team will ensure that environmental justice and human impacts are top of mind as we tackle these tough issues. After nearly a decade at the EPA, I know firsthand the remarkable dedication and talent of those career staff. And as a state official, I understand how actions from EPA can help or hurt local efforts. We’re going to ensure that EPA is once again a strong partner for the states, not a roadblock. We will be driven by our convictions, that every person in our great country has the right to clean air, clean water, and a healthier life, no matter how much money they have in their pockets, the color of their skin, or the community that they live in. We will move with a sense of urgency on climate change, protecting our drinking water and enact and environmental justice framework that empowers people in all communities. But we also know that these challenges can’t be solved by regulation alone. And we also know that environmental protection and equal economic prosperity. Well, they’re not mutually exclusive. They go hand in hand. We need an all hands on deck approach from industry to individuals finding common ground to Build Back Better for workers, for our communities, for our economy, and yes, for our planet. And that’s what we’ll pursue together. I look forward to continuing this work on behalf of the American people. So thank you. Good afternoon, Mr. President Elect, Madam President Elect, Madam Vice President Elect, I am honored and humbled by the trust you’ve placed in me, and I look forward to getting to work with this incredible team. I’m especially grateful for the chance to return to public service at a time when agency personnel are looking for optimism. And so many communities are struggling under the weight of persistent interwoven crises. I know firsthand the challenges that everyday people face when one unexpected illness or expense can upend the economic stability of a family. I grew up in the working class community of Waterbury, Connecticut, a town not so different from Scranton, Pennsylvania. I know the faces of the marginalized, and I appreciate the challenges of urban pollution. While the words climate change and environmental injustice were not part of the vernacular back then, the evidence of their impacts was all around. In that setting. There was plenty of opportunity to work to make a difference in people’s lives. For my parents, and particularly my father, dedication to tackling community challenges was vitally important. Service, in all its forms, was essential. They taught me to be a problem solver to recognize that each of us is blessed with different talents, and we are all called to bring those gifts to bear wherever we are to work with anyone and everyone to make things better in communities that we share. This has been the driving force and the guiding principle of my journey. I earned a high school scholarship that changed the course of my life. I became the first person in my family to go to college. I attended law school and at each stage I was aware of how different the world I came from was from the one I was entering. I didn’t set out to specialize in environmental issues, but once I started, I was always mindful of the practical implications of the decisions. As a staffer at the Connecticut commission on human rights, I learned that environmental protection and ensuring the health and wellbeing of all communities had to be reconciled. It is essential that we deploy smart and humane policy to help communities pull themselves back from the edge and improve the health, security and prosperity of all people. The Build Back Better plan is poised to breathe new life into the council on environmental quality. CQ we’ll work with a broad range of partners on a broad range of issues, tackle the full breadth of climate change, preserve the natural treasures of our nation, center environmental justice, and help more communities overcome legacy environmental impacts. I am grateful to the President Elect and Vice President Elect for elevating this work and lifting up the communities where it will make the most difference. Thank you for the opportunity to serve. Mr. President Elect, Madam Vice president Elect, thank you so much for this opportunity to serve and to work beside and with this incredibly talented team. The issues I’ve been taking on in this role are very personal to me and they have been for as long as I can remember. As keen listeners, you will already have guessed that I grew up in and around the city of Boston. My dad was a teacher in the Boston school system for more than 40 years. And my mom waitressed at local donut shops. Looking back, I guess we were a lower middle-class family, but we didn’t know it. Instead of expensive vacations, my sisters and I did our adventuring in our own backyards playing in the woods. Oops, I’m going to take that off. Playing in the woods and around ponds in our hometown. A beach day for my family was a swim and Boston Harbor. And at that point in time, it meant coming out of the water with oil and other things stuck to our skin. So we’d have to dry and clean ourselves all at the same time. Well, that was back in the sixties before the first Earth Day, but we managed and Boston Harbor today is terrific. But all I can think of is back when I was in grammar school and the nuns used to jump up and say, “Run. Close the windows in your classrooms.” Because when the rubber factory across the street started to spew chemical stenches into the air, it would come wafting into our classroom. And that smell kept us from recess more days than I, or my teacher ever cared to remember. So I figured out early that there was just an intrinsic connection between our environment and our health. And that understanding drew me into a very long career of public service, which I will never regret and always cherish. And I did it because I was trying to help families and communities just like mine, and those who are facing certainly much deeper and more insidious legacies of environmental harm so they could overcome the challenges that were holding them back. Environmental protection is part of my moral fiber. It’s what I live for. And I’m proud of the progress that we’ve made across the United States. And I’m proud of the work that I did for many years at local and state governments, as well as at EPA to make sure our air and water works were cleaner, to make communities safer and more livable, and begin to confront the crisis of climate change. And I’m here today because climate change is not only a threat to the planet. It is a threat to our health and our wellbeing. It’s a threat to people everywhere and the precious natural resources that we depend on. Defeating this threat is the fight of our lifetimes. And our success will require the engagement of every community, every sector in our nation, and every country in the world. But the opportunities to act on climate change right now, fill me with incredible optimism, with hope, with energy and excitement. We not only have the responsibility to meet this moment together, we have the capacity to meet this moment together. The President Elect has put together the strongest climate plan ever raised to this level of leadership. … And ever raised to this level of leadership. It rises to the incredible moment of opportunity we have to build back better, for our health, for jobs and for communities that have been systematically disadvantaged for years. It will be my incredible honor to help turn this plan into promises kept by marshaling every part of our government, working directly with communities and harnessing the force of science and the values of environmental justice to build a better future for my two very soon to be three little grandchildren, and for generations of Americans to come. So thank you for this opportunity to help put Americans back to work in innovative, good-paying, clean energy jobs, to improve the health of our communities and to help clear the path for people in every hometown in America to live brighter, cleaner, and more vibrant lives. Thank you. Thank you, President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Harris. I am deeply honored to answer your call to serve this nation that I love, especially at this moment of consequence. For our planet and for the people who live here, the peril of the climate crisis is already evident, but we can also see the promise in the jobs, casting and machining, installing and rewiring, pouring new foundations and building new industries. And in the possibility of repairing communities, hurt places where pollution has been heavy and opportunity has never quite reached. Mr. President-elect and Madam Vice President-elect, you campaigned on delivering that promise by mounting a response equal to the existential threat that we face, not only by listening to the science but also by invigorating the economy, revving up manufacturing and innovation, spurring good-paying union jobs and advancing justice long overdue, leading by the example of America at its best. When my parents moved from Pakistan to Pennsylvania, they brought two little kids and a few suitcases of dreams, dreams their kids are living today. Danish my brother, a doctor on the front lines of the COVID crisis and me, moving to the front lines of the fight against climate change. To be healthy, to have purpose, to be able to give back, that is how our parents taught us to define the American dream. I am so grateful to be serving alongside the team you have assembled. Grateful for Gina McCarthy, my guide and my good friend, for the incredible and inspiring leaders on this stage and for those with whom we’ll partner all across your administration. This has been a trying year for all Americans marked by so much loss, but throughout you, sir, have been there for us, and when the pandemic hit closer to home you were there for me. Mr. President-elect, that is who you are, a person of faith and family, of decency and goodness. Your leadership gives me hope. My students, scientists imagining and inventing, they give me hope. Young organizers, mobilizing and advocating they give me hope, and together I know we will meet this moment. Thank you and God bless you. Good afternoon. A few months ago as wildfires raged across the West I traveled home to California. What I saw on that trip and so many others in recent years was heartbreaking. Charred playgrounds, homes and neighborhoods in ashes, firefighters battling fires while their own homes burned to the ground. My brother-in-law is actually a firefighter in California as well. Some of the most toxic air anywhere in the world. Two years ago in 2018 when I visited communities like Paradise, California, that had been devastated by wildfires, that year’s fire season was considered the worst in California’s history. This fire season was even worse, the worst in California’s history and America’s history. And of course, fires are only one symptom of our growing climate crisis. In recent years families across the Midwest have experienced historic flooding while families all along our coasts have endured some of the most active hurricane seasons on record. They only name a storm if it’s particularly dangerous. This year we had more named storms than ever before. Our climate crisis is not a partisan issue and it is not a hoax. It is an existential threat to all of us, particularly poor communities and communities of color who bear the greatest risks from polluted air, polluted water, and a failing infrastructure. Many years ago, 15 years ago when I was district attorney in San Francisco I created the first environmental justice unit in the city and it was one of the first in our country because I believed then as I do now, everyone has a right to breathe clean air and drink clean water, and of course so does our President-elect Biden. Part of the reason I was so proud to join Joe Biden as his running mate was because he was proposing one of the most ambitious climate plans in history. A plan to secure carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035, a plan to achieve net zero emissions no later than 2050, a plan to invest in a clean energy future and create millions of good-paying union jobs along the way. And the team that President-elect Biden and I are announcing today will help make that plan a reality. These are some of our country’s most seasoned public servants and climate experts. They have experience mastering the most effective ways to get things done when it comes to climate change. They recognize the importance of bringing together the private sector and organized labor together with government to meet these challenges and to confront this crisis head-on with our allies and partners around the world. And they are compassionate leaders who understand that ultimately addressing climate change is about building safer communities and healthier communities, and thriving communities for all Americans. These public servants reflect the very best of America and they are the team we need to meet this urgent challenge. In his 2015 encyclical, the Holy Father, Pope Francis wrote, “Humanity still has the ability to work together in building our common home.” Starting on January 20th, we will work to heed those words and come together here in our country and around the world to build and protect our common home for generations to come. Thank you, Mr. President-elect for this day. Thank you. (silence)."
"163","12-20-19"," Welcome back. A quick reminder of the rules for this debate – each candidate has one minute and 15 seconds to answer direct questions from the moderators, and 45 seconds to answer rebuttal and follow-up questions. Tonight’s podium order on the stage was determined by an average of recent polls. To the candidates. Last night at this hour, the House of Representatives voted for only the third time in American history to impeach a president. Every one of you was in favor of this action. But unlike 1974 and President Nixon, congressional Democrats have so far not convinced a strong majority of Americans to support impeachment of President Trump. Why do you think that is, and what can you say or do differently in the coming weeks, to persuade more Americans that this is the right thing to do? I want to ask all of you to respond, but to begin with Vice President Biden. You know, Judy, it was a constitutional necessity for the House to act as it did, and Trump’s response to suggest that only half of the American people want to see him thrown out of office now, I find is dumbing down the presidency beyond what I even thought he would do. Is any wonder that if you look at the international polling that’s been done that the Chinese leader is rated above American, the American president. Or that Vladimir Putin congratulated him saying, “Stand fast,” and in fact it was a mistake to impeach him. We need to restore the integrity of the presidency, of the office of the presidency. And it’s about time we get that underway. My job, and I think the job of all of us up here, is to, in fact, well that’s not true, some are going to be actually voting in the Senate. But my job is to just go out and make the case why he doesn’t deserve to be president of United States for another four years. Well, Judy, what I would say is that we have a president who is a pathological liar. We have a president who is running the most corrupt administration in the modern history of this country. And we have a president who is a fraud, because during his campaign he told working people one thing, and he ended up doing something else. I believe, and I will personally be doing this in the coming weeks and months, is making the case that we have a president who has sold out the working families of this country, who wants to cut social security, Medicare, and Medicaid, after he promised he would not do that, and who has documentedly lied thousands of times since he is president. And the case to be made is, yeah, certainly, I disagree with Trump on virtually all of his policies, but what conservatives, I think, understand, is that we cannot have a president with that temperament, who is dishonoring the presidency of the United States. Senator Warren, why do you think, why do you think more Americans don’t agree that this is the right thing to do and what more can you say? E. So I see this as a constitutional moment. Last night, the president was impeached, and everyone now in the Senate who’s taken a constitutional oath to uphold our constitution, and that doesn’t mean loyalty to an individual, it doesn’t mean loyalty to a political party, it means loyalty to our country, and that vote will play out over the next several weeks. But the way I see this is we’ve now seen the impact of corruption, and that’s what’s clearly on the stage in 2020, is how we are going to run against the most corrupt president in living history. This president has made corruption, originally, his argument, that he would drain the swamp. And yet he came to Washington, broke that promise, and has done everything he can for the wealthy and the well-connected, from tax breaks to ambassadorships. We have to prosecute the case against him, and that means we need a candidate for president who can draw the sharpest distinction between the corruption of the Trump administration and a Democrat who is willing to get out and fight, not for the wealthy and well-connected, but to fight for everyone else. That’s why I’m in this race. Let me make the case to the American people. As a wise judge said, “The president is not king in America; the law is king.” And what James Madison once said when he was speaking out at the constitutional convention, and by the way I think he’s a pretty good size for a president, he was five foot four. And what he said, he said the reason that we have these impeachment articles in the constitution, that the provisions are in there, is because he feared that a president would betray the trust of the American people for a foreign power. That is what happened here. Watergate. This is a global Watergate. In the case of Watergate, a paranoid president facing election looked for dirt on a political opponent. He did it by getting people to break in. This president did it by calling a foreign leader to look for dirt on a political opponent. And I would make this case: as we face his trial in the Senate, if the president claims that he is so innocent, then why doesn’t he have all the president’s men testify? Richard Nixon had his top people testify. We should be hearing from Mulvaney, who is the one under oath. Witnesses have said that Mulvaney is the one that said, “Okay, we’re going to withhold this aid to a fledgling democracy to get dirt on a political opponent.” We should hear from Bolden, who told his own staff to go see a lawyer after they met with the president. That is the case. If President Trump thinks that he should not be impeached, he should be not scared to put forward his own witnesses. At the end of the day, this is beyond public opinion, this is beyond polls, this is beyond politics. The president left the House with no choice, and I think a lot of us are watching this process, watching Washington go through the motions and not expecting much, but a foregone conclusion when it gets to the Senate. We cannot give in to that sense of helplessness because that’s what they want. They want us to be taken in by that cynicism where we give up on the process altogether. Meanwhile, their allies are laughing all the way to the bank. As we see policies that let giant corporations, some of which made billions in profits, pay, not just zero, but as we’ve recently learned, negative taxes, all while they block policies that would actually boost wages for working Americans. Here’s the good news – it’s up to us. No matter what happens in the Senate, it is up to us in 2020. This is our chance to refuse to be taken in by the helplessness, to refuse and reject the cynicism. That is what this presidential election is about. It is what my campaign is about. Our opportunity in 2020, no matter what happens in Washington, as a country, to change the course of this nation for the better. Mr. I’m over here. Mr. Judy, Judy, sorry. I’m sorry, Mr. Steyer, I’m sorry. Well, let me remind everyone that I’m the person who started The Need to Impeach movement over two years ago. Because I believe what counts here is actually the American people’s opinion. Over eight and a half million signed that petition and dragged Washington into the idea that actually the most corrupt president in American history, it’s not a question of political expediency, it’s not a question of political tactics, it’s a question of right and wrong. So now when we look what’s going on, I actually agree with Senator Klobuchar. The question here is, if we want the American people to understand what’s going on, we need to have the administration officials testify on TV so we can judge. The court that counts here is the court of public opinion. The American people deserve to see the truth of these administration officials testifying under oath, so we can make up our mind. If we want Republican senators to do the right thing, we need their constituents to see the truth on TV, and tell them, “Get rid of this guy or we’ll get rid of you.” That’s what I believe in. I’m a believer in the grassroots, as an outsider, getting the American people’s voice to count. That’s who I trust and that’s who I trust now. Mr. Yang. It’s clear why Americans can’t agree on impeachment. We’re getting our news from different sources, and it’s making it hard for us even to agree on basic facts. Congressional approval rating, last I checked, it was something like 17 percent, and Americans don’t trust the media networks to tell them the truth. The media networks didn’t do us any favors by missing a reason why Donald Trump became our president in the first place. If you turn on cable network news today, you would think he’s our president because of some combination of Russia, racism, Facebook, Hillary Clinton, and e-mails all mixed together. But Americans around the country, no different. We blasted away four million manufacturing jobs that were primarily based in Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Missouri. I just left Iowa. We blasted 40,000 manufacturing jobs there. The more we act like Donald Trump is the cause of all of our problems, the more Americans lose trust that we can actually see what’s going on in our communities and solve those problems. What we have to do is we have to stop being obsessed over impeachment, which unfortunately strikes many Americans like a ballgame where you know what the score is going to be, and start actually digging in and solving the problems that got Donald Trump elected in the first place. We have to take every opportunity to present a new positive vision for the country, a new way forward to help beat him in 2020, because make no mistake, he’ll be there at the ballot box for us to defeat. Thank you, Mr, Yang. Let’s turn now to an issue that is on the minds of all Americans, and that is the economy. Senator Sanders, today, the House of Representatives voted for a new bipartisan trade agreement among the United States, Canada, and Mexico. It was supported by union-friendly leaders like Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and big labor groups like the AFL-CIO. They say it is going to be a big job creator. Judy, you’re talking to somebody who, unlike some of my colleagues here, voted against NAFTA, voted against PNC [inaudible 00:11:45] with China, two agreements that cost us over four million decent-paying jobs. Now, I don’t agree with the, your statement that people think this is going to be a great job creator. This is a modest improvement over what we have right now. It would allow, hopefully, Mexican workers to organize into unions or independent unions, and be able to negotiate decent contracts. But at the end of the day, in my view, it is not going to stop outsourcing. It is not going to stop corporations from moving to Mexico, where manufacturing workers make less than two dollars an hour. What we need is a trade policy that stands up for workers, stands up for farmers, and, by the way, the word “climate change,” to the best of my knowledge, is not discussed in this new NAFTA agreement at all, which is an outrage. So no, I will not be voting for this agreement, although it makes some modest improvements. I have a different view. I’ll go with my friend Sherrod Brown, who has voted against every trade agreement that’s come in front of him, and he’s voting for this, and I am too. And the reason I am voting for it is that I believe that we have a change with this agreement. I would not have voted for the agreement that President Trump put forward, but we’ve got better labor standards, better environmental standards, and a better deal when it comes to the pharmaceutical provision, which I also oppose. 95 percent of our customers are outside of our borders, and we have to make sure that we have trade agreements that are more fair, because if we can encourage work made in America, every time you hold something in your hand that says “made in America,” it is the ingenuity of our workers. It is equality of a product, it is equality of our workers, and it is the hopes and dreams of the American people. I think this agreement, while Senator Sanders is correct, there are some issues with it, is much better than the one originally proposed. And for those farmers in the Midwest, and for those people that have been hurt by the fact that we will not have a trade segment with Mexico and with Canada and the United States, I think that this is a much better deal. All right. We can pull some of your, I see some other hands up. I want to move to the next question and you can bring in, I think, your points with this, but this one I’m going to initially address to Vice President Biden, and that is the overall U.S. economy right now looks strong. The unemployment rate is at historic lows, unemployment among African Americans is down, the markets are booming, wages, while not growing as much as many would like, they’re still doing about as well as they were in the Obama/Biden era. My question to you, Mr. Well, I don’t think they really do like the economy. Go back and talk to the old neighbors in the middle class neighborhoods you grew up in. The middle class is getting killed. The middle class is getting crushed and the working class has no way up as a consequence of that. You have, for example, farmers in the Midwest, 40 percent of them could pay, couldn’t pay their bills last year. You have most Americans, if they’ve received the bill for 400 dollars or more, they’d have to sell something or borrow the money. The middle class is not, is behind the eight ball. We have to make sure that they have an even shot. We have to eliminate significant number of these god-awful tax cuts that were given to the very wealthy. We have to invest in education. We have to invest in healthcare. We have to invest in those things that make a difference in the lives of middle class people so they can maintain their standard of living. That’s not being done, and the idea that we’re growing, we’re not growing. The wealthy, very wealthy are growing. Ordinary people are not growing. They are not happy with where they are, and that’s why we must change this presidency now. Yes. Where I live folks aren’t measuring the economy by how the Dow Jones is looking, they’re measuring the economy by how they’re doing. When you’re doing the bills at the end of the month at your kitchen table, and you find that, even if your wages have gone up, is not nearly going as fast as the cost of health, and how’s… This economy is not working for most of us, for the middle class, and, I know you’re only ever supposed to say middle class and not poor in politics, but we’ve got to talk about poverty in this country. There is not one county in the United States of America where someone working full time at the minimum wage can afford a two bedroom apartment. In most places, not even a one bedroom apartment. The biggest problem in our economy is simple – people are not getting paid enough. That is not the result of some mysterious cosmic force. It’s the result of bad policy, and we’ve got to change it by raising wages and empowering workers. Mr. Yang, Mr. Yang. GDP and corporate profits are at record highs in America today. Also at record highs, depression, financial insecurity, student loan debt, even suicides and drug overdoses. It has gotten so bad that our life expectancy as a country has declined for the last three years, because suicides and drug overdoses have overtaken vehicle deaths for the first time in American history. The fact is, this unemployment rate and GDP have very little relationship with people’s lived experience on the ground. If you’re a recent college graduate, you have a 40 percent chance of doing a job that doesn’t require a college degree. That doesn’t show up in the headline unemployment rate, nor does all of the families that are working two or three jobs to get by. Senator Warren, you have your hand up. E. I do. And I have a question for you. E. Go ahead- E. Go ahead- E. Because here’s the problem. I’m proud to stand on a stage with Democrats who understand that a rising GDP, rising corporate profits, is not being felt by millions of families across this country. I’m proud to stand on a stage with people who see that America’s middle class is being hollowed out, and that working families and poor people are being left behind. E. What we need to talk about, though, is why that has happened, and the answer is we’ve got a government that works great for those with money, and doesn’t work for much of anyone else. We have a government that works great for giant drug companies, just not for someone trying to fill a prescription. Works great for people who want to make money at private prisons and private detention centers at our border, just not for the people whose lives are torn apart. Works great for giant oil companies that want to drill everywhere, but not for the rest of us, who see climate change bearing down upon us. And when you see a government that works great for the wealthy and the well-connected and for no one else, that is corruption, pure and simple, and we need to call it out for what it is. I want… I want Senator Sanders, if you would, a brief response, and then I have another question. Look, here’s the response. Trump goes around saying, “The economy is doing great.” Do you know what, real inflation accounted for, wages went up last year? One point one percent. That ain’t great. Tonight, while three people own more wealth than the bottom half of America, 500,000 Americans, including 30,000 veterans are sleeping out on the streets. Today in America, we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on Earth, more income and wealth inequality since the 1920s. We need an economy that works for working families, not just the 1 percent. That is what our campaign is about. Senator Warren, I have a question for you. Every candidate on the stage has proposed tax increases on the wealthy. But you have especially ambitious plans that, apart from healthcare, would hike taxes an additional eight trillion dollars over the decade, the biggest tax increase since World War II. How do you answer top economists who say taxes of this magnitude would stifle growth and investment? E. Oh, they’re just wrong. Let’s start with a wealth tax. The idea of a two cent tax on the great fortunes in this country, 50 million dollars and above. For two cents, what can we do? We can invest in the rest of America. We can provide universal childcare, early childhood education for every baby in this country, age zero to five. Universal pre-K for every three year old and four year old and raise the wage. E. … Pre K for every three-year-old and four-year-old and raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher. We can do even more for our public schools, for college graduates, we can cancel student loan debt, but think about the economic impact of that. You leave two cents with the billionaires. They’re not eating more pizzas, they’re not buying more cars. We invest that 2% in early childhood education and childcare. That means those babies get top notch care. It means their mamas can finish their education. It means their mamas in their daddies can take on real jobs, harder jobs, longer hours. We can increase productivity in this country and we can start building this economy from the ground up. That’s how we built it in small towns, that’s how we built it in rural America and that’s how we built it in urban America. An economy that works. Brief answers. E. Not from Wall Street, but that works for main stram. Brief Responses from Mr. Steyer and Mr. Buttigieg. Let me say that I agree with Senator Warren in much of what she says. I’ve been for a wealth tax for over a year. I’m in favor of undoing all the tax breaks for rich people and big corporations [crosstalk 00:22:18] that this administration has put through. And in addition, I’ve talked about equilibrating the taxes on passive investment income, which would allow us to cut taxes for 95% of Americans by 10%. But there’s something else going on here that I think is really important, and that’s this. We know Mr. Trump’s going to run on the economy. I built a business over 30 years from scratch. We’re going to have to take him on, on the economy in terms of growth as well as economic justice. We’re going to have to be able to talk about growth, prosperity across the board for everyone in America. My experience building a business, understanding how to make that happen means I can go toe to toe with Mr. Trump and take him down on the economy and expose him as a fraud and a failure. And I think that’s different from the other people on this stage. Mayor. Best prepared candidate in American history and beat her. Mayor, Buttigieg. Right now I think we’re being offered a false choice. You either have to go all the way to the extreme or it’s business as usual. Yes, we must deliver big ideas and yes, taxes on wealthy individuals and on corporations are going to have to go up. We can also be smart about the promises we’re making. Make sure they’re promises that we can keep without the kind of taxation that economists tell us could hurt the economy. It’s why, for example, I propose that we make college free for 80% of Americans, but it doesn’t have to be free for the top. If you’re in that top 10% how you pay your own tuition and we save those dollars for something else that we could spend them on, that would make a big difference. Whether it’s infrastructure, childcare, housing, health. On issue after issue, we’ve got to break out of the Washington mindset that measures the bigness of an idea by how many trillions of dollars it adds to the budget or the boldness of an idea by how many fellow Americans it can antagonize. We’re going to take a short break and we’ll be right back in two minutes with questions from my fellow moderators. [inaudible 00:24:43] Welcome back everyone. We are here back at the break in this debate, the first of three breaks. This is a short one. I’m joined by of course, our fantastic panel of analysts and journalists and I want to first ask you, Stephanie Sy and Amy Walter, we hit the two big topics right off the top. Impeachment. Basically president Trump. How do you deal with him and the economy? Let’s start with the economy. That’s the number one issue for voters here. The difference we heard was at the very end there with Pete Buttigieg saying, we got to make sure that they are promises that we can keep. And going back, something we talked about before the debate began, this sense of breaking away from Elizabeth Warren by saying we can be big, we can be bold, we can have really progressive ideas, but if we look like we are measuring our boldness just in how much tax we are putting on Americans, how big the programs are going to be, that’s just going to come back and hurt the democratic nominee. Stephanie Sy. So first of all, Elizabeth Warren’s answer to Judy’s question. She didn’t answer it directly. She just said, “No, those models are wrong. “What about the economic data that [crosstalk 00:26:03]?” She said “They’re just wrong. Yeah. And you know, the fact is Wharton at the University of Pennsylvania came out with a budget model just last week and did say that her model in the next 10 years could constrain GDP growth. So there are different models out there. She’s going to have to continue to explain that question. If she makes it into the general election. [crosstalk 00:26:21] and she has to also have some details. That’s all right. It looks like candidates might’ve gotten their drinks of water. I hope you did too. And we’re going to go back to the stage momentarily again for the PBS NewsHour, Politico Democratic Debate, many more big issues to come, stay tuned. [inaudible 00:05:43]. Live from Angeles, the PBS NewsHour, Politico Democratic Debate continues. Once again, Judy Woodruff. Welcome back to the PBS NewsHour Politico Democratic Presidential Debate. The next question is from Tim Alberta of Politico. Thanks Judy. Candidates, good evening. We’re going to talk about climate now. Senator Klobuchar, many scientists say that even if the US reduced its carbon footprint to zero by the year 2050 the damage will have been done. The climate change will have made certain places in the US unlivable. So knowing this, would you support a new federal program to subsidize the relocation of American families and businesses away from places like Miami or Paradise, California, perhaps. Davenport, Iowa. Because we know these places are going to be hit time and time again. Well, I very much hope we’re not going to have to relocate entire cities, but we will probably have to relocate some individual residents. And the problem right now is that this climate change is this existential crisis and you are seeing it here in California with the fires that you just had. You saw it in Northern California as was mentioned with Paradise and the most moving video from that to me was a 30 second video of that dad driving his little girl through the lapping fires with his neighborhood burning behind him and singing to her to calm her down. We cannot wait to act. There’s an Ojibwe saying that great leaders make decisions, not for this generation, but seven generations from now. This president doesn’t keep his decisions for seven minutes. So what I think we need to do get back into the International Climate Change Agreement. I will do that on day one. On day two, bring back the clean power rules on day three, the gas mileage standards. I see the governor of California who has been working so hard to get those done, defied every step of the way by the Trump administration. And then introduced sweeping legislation to put a price on carbon and build a fridge to the next century, which means we must upgrade our buildings and our building standards. Thank you, Senator Klobuchar. Look, I am hoping that we in fact will do what I’m suggesting, which is declare a state of emergency on day one of my presidency. I believe I’m the only person here who will say unequivocally, this is my number one priority. I know that we have to deal with this crisis. I know that we have to deal with it from the standpoint of environmental justice. I’ve been working on this for more than a decade. I’ve taken on oil companies and beaten them on environmental laws. I’ve pushed clean energy across this country. I’ve prevented pipelines and I’ve prevented fossil fuel plants. But I know is this, not only can we clean up the air and water in the black and brown communities where our pollution is concentrated. This is also the opportunity to create literally millions of middle-class union jobs well-paid across the United States of America. Our biggest crisis is our biggest opportunity and if we don’t declare a state of emergency on day one, I don’t understand how we go to the people around the world to lead the coalition that has to happen and that only America can lead. Look, this is a generational question. I have a lot of respect for the people on this stage. I know everybody is worried about this, but for instance, I would call on Mayor Buttigieg to prioritize this higher. Because the people in his generation understand that this is a crisis that we have to go on right now, but it’s also the greatest opportunity to rebuild and reinvent America. Thank you, Mr. Steyer. Mr. Buttigieg, 45 seconds to respond. Well, I’ve made clear that this will be a topic of day one action, and this is not theoretical for me. I live in one of those river cities that you’re talking about. Not only that, I live right by the river. My neighborhood flooded in the second of two once in a millennium floods that we had in two years. Do the math on that so I know what’s at stake and it’s why I insist that we act with a carbon tax and dividend with massive increases in renewable research on renewable energy, energy storage and carbon storage. But bigger than that, you have to summon the energies of the entire country to deal with this. I’ve seen politicians in Washington saying the right thing about climate change for as long as I’ve been alive. All these plans we have to get carbon neutral by 2050, and I think most or all of us have one. Their impact is multiplied by zero unless something actually gets done. And that is why I want to make sure that our vision for climate includes people from the auto worker down the block from me in South Bend, to a farmer a few minutes away, so that they understand that we are asking, recruiting them to be part of the solution. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Not beating them over the head and telling them they are part of the problem. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. We’d like to switch gears slightly. Vice president Biden, I’d like to ask you, three consecutive American presidents have enjoyed stints of explosive economic growth due to a boom in oil and natural gas production. The answer’s yes. The answer’s yes, because the opportunity for those workers to transition to high paying jobs, as Tom said, is real. We’re the only country in the world’s ever taken great, great crises and turned them into an enormous opportunities. I’ve met with the union leaders. For example, we should, in fact, making sure right now that every new building built is energy contained, that it doesn’t leak energy. That in fact we should be providing tax credits for people to be able to make homes turn to solar power where there’s all kinds of folks out here, right here in California. We’re now on the verge of having batteries that are about the size of the top of this podium that you can store energy when in fact the wind isn’t blowing and the sun isn’t shining. We have enormous opportunities. For example, you talk about would we relocate people who in fact we’re in a position where they lost their home. We have to not rebuild to the standard that existed before when we talk about when we come in and help people. We have to rebuild the standard that exists today. For example, we shouldn’t build another new highway in America that doesn’t have charging stations on it. We have an opportunity to put 550,000 charging stations so that we own the electric vehicle market, creating millions of jobs for people and installing them as well as making sure that we own the electric vehicle market. There’s so many things we can do and we have to make sure we explain it to those people who are displaced, that their skills are going to be needed for the new opportunities. Thank you, Vice President Biden. Senator Sanders. Tim, in all due respect, your question misses the mark. It is not an issue of relocating people in towns. The issue now is whether we save the planet for our children and our grandchildren. The issue, as you should know, what the scientists are telling us, is they have underestimated the threat and severity of climate change. You’re talking about the Paris Agreement, that’s fine. Ain’t enough. We have got to, and I’ve introduced legislation to do this, declare a national emergency. The United States has got to lead the world and maybe, just maybe, instead of spending 1.8 trillion a year globally on weapons of destruction, maybe an American president, i.e. Bernie Sanders can lead the world. Instead of spending money to kill each other, maybe we pool our resources and fight our common enemy, which is climate change. Thank you, Senator Sanders. Senator Warren, a new question to you, Senator Warren. Many of our Western allies rely heavily on nuclear energy because it’s efficient, affordable, and virtually carbon free. And many climate experts believe that it’s impossible to realize your goal of net zero emissions by the year 2050 without utilizing nuclear energy. So can you have it both ways on this issue? E. So I see right now is, we’ve got to get the carbon, we’ve got to stop putting more carbon into the air. We’ve got to get the carbon out of the air and out of the water and that means that we need to keep some of our nuclear in place. I will not build more nuclear. I want to put the energy literally and the money and the resources behind clean energy and by increasing by 10 fold what we put into science, what we put into research and development. We need to do what we do best. And that is innovate our way out of this problem and be a world leader. But understand the biggest climate problem we face is the politicians in Washington who keeps saying the right thing, but continue to take money from the oil industry. Continue to bow down to the lobbyist, to the lawyers, to the think tanks to the bought and paid for experts. E. America understands that we’ve got to make change and we’re running out of time. That climate change threatens every living thing on this planet. But getting Congress to act, they just don’t want to hear it. And if we don’t attack the corruption first, if we don’t attack the corruption head on, then we’re not going to be able to make the changes we need to make on climate, on gun safety, on drug pricing, on all of the big problems that face us. We need a Washington that doesn’t just work for the rich and the powerful. We need one that works for our families. Thank you, Senator. Senator Klobuchar, and then I’d like to bring in Senator Yang and Mr. Steyer with the follow ups. I wanted to add to what Elizabeth said. So the way we tackle this corruption is by winning big in this election and the way we take on climate change in a big way is by yes, talking about what’s happening on the coast is I just did, but also talking about what’s happening in the Midwest, where I’m from. It’s not fly over country to me, I live there. And what we are seeing there is unprecedented flooding. We’re seeing an increase. 50% increase in homeowners insurance over the last few years and when we make these changes, we have to make clear to people that when we put a price on carbon that that money is going to come back to those areas where people are going to be hurt, where jobs are going to change and to make them whole with their energy bills. When you make the case like that, you bring in the Midwestern votes, you win big, and I think the best way to do it is by putting someone at the top of the ticket who’s from the Midwest. Mr. Yang, 45 seconds on the issue of nuclear energy. Well first we should obviously be paying to relocate Americans away from places that are hit by climate change. We’re already doing it. We relocated a town in Louisiana that became uninhabitable because the sea levels rose. And we know that town is not alone. That’s playing out in coastal areas around the country. The question is, do you leave that town on its own to fend for itself or do you come together as a country and say, “We need to protect our people from climate change?” Part of my plan is literally called move people to higher ground. Because that’s what we need to do and that’s literal and figurative. Here in California, it’s forest fires and forest management. And nuclear power, I agree with the research. We need to have everything on the table in a crisis situation, which this is. Other countries have had success with nuclear power and the next generation Thoriam reactors have a wealth of potential. Thoriam is not radioactive the way uranium is. It doesn’t last as long and you can’t make a weapon out of it. Whereas if we’re going to innovate our way out of this, as Elizabeth is saying, then we have to have nuclear on the table. Thank you, Mr. Yang. The last one on the climate to you, Mr. Steyer. The point about nuclear power is, it’s not at the stage in the United States where it’s competitive on price. It has a lot of risks to it in terms of disasters and we have no ability to store the toxins that come out of it and last a hundred thousand years. We actually have the technology that we need. It’s called wind and solar and batteries. So in fact, what we need to do, we can do. We’ve got to stop taking a look at this as something that we can’t do because we can do this, and we can do it in a way that rebuilds this country on an accelerated basis. Creates millions of union jobs and we come at it from the standpoint of environmental justice. This is our greatest opportunity to reinvent this country, to actually take on the biggest challenge in history and succeed together. You want to pull the country together with all this partisanship? Let’s take on the biggest challenge in history and succeed together as a nation. That’s what pulls people together. Thank you, Mr. Steyer. Amna. Thanks, Tim. Vice President Biden. Yes. You’ve been reassuring voters that things will return to normal. Once president Trump leaves office, that Republicans will have what you call an epiphany and come to the table to work with the Biden administration. Look, I didn’t say return to normal. Normal is not enough. In fact, we would have to move beyond normal, whether it’s healthcare or the environment, whatever it is, we have to build on what we had started in our administration and that’s been interrupted very badly. Number one. Number two, with Trump out of the way, it’s not going to change things in a fundamental way, but what it will do is it will mean that we’re in a position where his base is not going to be able to intimidate those half a dozen Republicans we may need in other things. I refuse to accept the notion as some on the stage do that we can never, never get to a place where we have cooperation again. If that’s the case, where dead as a country, we need to be able to reach consensus. And if anyone has reason to be angry with the Republicans and not want to cooperate, it’s me the way they’ve attacked me and my son and my family. I have no love. But the fact is, we have to be able to get things done. And when we can’t convince them, we go out and beat them like we did in the 2018 election in red states and in purple states. Thank you. Mr Biden. Mr gang, I want to switch topics to you, Mr. Yang, a new question. The democratic party relies on black, Hispanic, and Asian voters. But you are the only candidate of color on the stage tonight and the entire field remains overwhelmingly white. It’s both an honor and disappointment to be the lone candidate of color on the stage tonight. …Honor and disappointment to be the lone candidate of color on the stage tonight. I miss Kamala. I miss Cory, though I think Cory will be back. I grew up the son of immigrants and I had many racial epithets used against me as a kid, but black and Latinos have something much more powerful working against them than words. They have numbers. The average net worth of a black household is only 10% that of a white household. For Latinos, it’s 12%. If you’re a black woman, you’re 320% more likely to die from complications in childbirth. These are the numbers that define race in our country. And the question is, why am I the lone candidate of color on this stage? Fewer than 5% of Americans donate to political campaigns. You know what you need to donate to political campaigns? Disposable income. The way we fix it… The way we fix this is we take Martin Luther King’s message of a guaranteed minimum income, a freedom dividend of $1,000 a month for all Americans. I guarantee, if we had a freedom dividend of $1,000 a month, I would not be the only candidate of color on this stage tonight. Thank you, Mr. Yang. Senator Sanders, I do want to put the same question to you, Senator Sanders. I will answer that question, but I wanted to get back to the issue of climate change for a moment because I do believe this is the existential issue. Senator, with all respect, this question is about race. I certainly can because people of color, in fact, are going to be the people suffering most if we do not deal with climate change. And by the way, we have an obligation up here if there are not any of our African American brothers and sisters up here, to speak about an economy in which African Americans are exploited, where black women die three times at higher rates than white women, where we have a criminal justice system which is racist and broken, disproportionately made up of African Americans and Latinos and Native Americans who are in jail. So we need an economy that focuses on the needs of oppressed, exploited people and that is the African American community. Thank you, Senator. Yamiche. Thank you, Amna. Senator Klobuchar, here in California, people who identify as Hispanic, black, Asian, or multiracial represent a majority of the population, outnumbering white residents. The United States is expected to be majority non-white within a generation. I’d say this is America. You’re looking at it. And we are not going to be able to succeed in the world if we do not invite everyone to be part of our economy. Our constitution says that we strive for a more perfect union. Well that’s what we are in doing right now. And to me that means, one, that everyone can vote, and that includes our communities of color. This action that’s been taken by this president and his people and his governors all over the country is wrong. They have made it harder for African Americans to vote. As one court said, “Discriminated with surgical precision. What would I do as one of the leaders on voting in the US Senate? One, stop the purging. As Stacey Abrams said, you do not stop having your right to assemble if you don’t go to a meeting for a year. Because you don’t go to a church or synagogue or a mosque for three months, you don’t lose your right to worship. You shouldn’t lose your right to vote. I would pass, as president, my bill to register every kid in this country when they turn 18 to vote. That would make all of these discriminatory actions in these states go away and I would stop the gerrymandering, in addition to the agenda of economic opportunity. Thank you, Senator. Let’s now turn to the issue of foreign policy and the Middle East. Senator Sanders, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo recently declared that the United States believes Israeli settlements in the West Bank do not violate international law. That broke decades long US precedent. Israel has… And I say this is somebody who lived in Israel as a kid, proudly Jewish. Israel has the right, not only to exist, but to exist in peace and security. But what US foreign policy must be about is not just being pro-Israel, we must be pro- Palestinian as well. And whether… In my view. We must understand that right now in Israel we have leadership under Netanyahu, who has recently, as you know, been indicted for bribery. Who in my view is a racist. What we need is a level playing field in terms of the Middle East, which addresses the terrible crisis in Gaza, where 60 or 70% of the young people are unemployed. So what my foreign policy will be about is human rights, is democracy, is bringing people together in a peaceful way, trying to negotiate agreements, not endless wars with trillions of dollars of expenses. Thank you, Senator. Mayor Buttigieg. What we are seeing in the Middle East and around the world are the consequences of this president’s failure, this president’s refusal to lead. It’s particularly disturbing in the case of Israel because he has infused domestic politics, making US foreign policy choices in order to effectively interfere in Israeli domestic politics. Acting as though that somehow makes him pro- Israel and pro- Jewish while welcoming white nationalists into The White House. But it’s not only in the Middle East that we see the consequences of the disappearance of US leadership. We see among our allies and among our adversaries, case after case, where the world is making plans on what to do, ignoring the United States because we’re no longer considered reliable. It’s not just the mockery at a cocktail party on the sidelines of a conference, it’s the looks on the faces of the leaders at the UN as they looked at the United States President with a mixture of contempt and pity. As an American, I never again want to see the American President looked at that way by the leaders of the world. The world needs America right now, but it can’t be just any American. It has to be one that is actually living up to the values that make us who we are. Supporting peace, supporting democracy, supporting human rights and supporting stability around the world. Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg. Senator Warren, President Obama pledged to close the detention camp at Guantanamo Bay, but could not. 40 prisoners remain there. Last year, US taxpayers paid $540 million to keep Guantanamo open. Would you pledge to finally close the detention facility and if elected, how will you do it? E. Yes, it’s time to close this detention facility. It not only costs us money, it is an international embarrassment. We have to be an America that lives our values every single day. We can’t be an America that stands up and asks people to fight alongside us, as we did with the Kurds in fighting ISIS, and then turn around in the blink of a tweet and say that we’re turning our backs on the people who stood beside us. After that, who wants to be an ally of the United States? We have to be an America that understands the difference and recognizes the difference between our allies, the people who will work alongside us, and the dictators who would do us harm. And we need to treat our allies better than we treat the dictators. That needs to be our job as an America. E. We have the finest military on earth. All three of my brothers served and we have people on this stage who have served and I’m deeply grateful for that. Our military is strong and important, but we need to be an America that relies on our State Department, that relies on diplomacy, that relies on our economic power and that relies on working together with the rest of the world to build a world that is sustainable environmentally and economically for everyone. Thank you, Senator Warren. Vice President Biden. We attempted to close Guantanamo Bay, but you have to have congressional authority to do it. They’ve kept it open. And the fact is that we in fact think it’s the greatest… It is an advertisement for creating terror. Look, what we have done around the world in terms of keeping Guantanamo open or what Trump has done by no longer being an honest broker in Israel, there is no solution for Israel other than a two state solution. It does not exist. It’s not possible to have a Jewish state in Middle East without there being a two state solution. And he has played to all the same fears and all the prejudices that exist in this country and in Israel. Bibi Netanyahu and I know one another well. He knows that I think what he’s doing is outrageous. What we do is we have to put pressure constantly on the Israelis to move to a two state solution, not withdraw a physical aid from them in terms of their security. Thank you, Vice President Biden. Senator Warren is correct. We have led by, not the example of our power, but the power of our example. And the example we’re demonstrating now is horrible. It’s hurting us badly. Thank you, Vice President Biden. Judy. I want to turn to another part of the world and that’s China. Mayor Buttigieg, you have said that you think China presents more of a challenge than do your fellow candidates believe. The US clearly wants China’s cooperation on human rights, on climate change, on North Korea, on terrorism, and yet Americans are appalled by China’s record on human rights, including the detention of over a million Muslim Uyghurs. I think that any tool ought to be on the table, especially diplomatic, economic and social tools like what you’re describing. Look, for the president to let it be known that his silence, whether it’s on the rounding up of Muslim Uyghurs in Xinjiang, putting them into camps, or the aspirations of the people of Hong Kong for democracy. For him to let China know that his silence can be purchased is trashing American values. The reality is that there’s a lot more to the relationship with China than who’s selling more dishwashers? Yes, we need a much smarter trade policy. We also have to acknowledge what’s going on over there. The use of technology for the perfection of dictatorship. That is going to require a stronger than ever response from the US in defense of democracy. But when folks out there standing up for democracy hear not a peep from the President of the United States, what message is that sending to the Chinese Communist Party? The message I will send is that if they perpetrate a repeat of anything like Tienanmen Square when it comes to Hong Kong, they will be isolated from the free world and we will lead that isolation diplomatically and economically. Mr. Steyer, many Americans have been moved in the last months by the protests of the people of Hong Kong. Look, there is a temptation, particularly for this president, to try and answer that in a bilateral way. The way the United States should be reacting in Hong Kong is by gathering our coalition of democracy and freedom loving partners and allies to push back. In fact, when we’re making moral statements around the world, it should not be us threatening and trying to be the world’s policemen. It should be us leading on a value driven basis with the other people who share our values and want to change the world. We actually can’t isolate ourselves from China. In fact, we have to work with them as a frienemy. People who disturb us, who we disagree with, but who in effect we are linked to in a world that is ever getting closer. And in fact, if we are going to treat climate as the threat that it is, we are going to have to partner with the Chinese. They are going to have to come along with us. They’re going to have to trust us and together we’re going to have to solve this problem. Thank you, Mr. Steyer. It’s off the table. We need a good relationship with them. We’re going to have to work with them going forward under all circumstances. Thank you, Mr. Steyer. Vice President Biden, on China, we now know that China is engaged in an unprecedented military buildup. They have just launched a new aircraft carrier. There are new signs of their disturbing espionage campaign here inside the United States. There are a number of disturbing signs from the Chinese. National security scholars have long warned about the historical precedent that when there’s a ruling power and a rising power, there’s likely to be a war. Is the US on a collision course with China? What steps could you take as president? E. It’s on a collision course with China but not for war. What we have to make clear is that we in fact are not going to abide by what they’ve done. 1 million Uyghurs, as you pointed out, Muslims, are in concentration camps. That’s where they are right now. They’re being abused. They’re in concentration camps. And what we started in our administration that Trump stopped, we should be moving 60% of our seat power to that area of the world. To let in fact the Chinese understand that they’re not going to go any further. We are going to be there to protect other folks. E. Secondly, we in fact should make sure that we began to rebuild our alliances, which Trump has demolished, with Japan and South Korea, Australia and Indonesia. We in fact need to have allies who understand that we’re going to stop the Chinese from their actions. We should be gone to the UN immediately and sought sanctions against them and the United Nations for what they did. We have to be firm. We don’t have to go to war but we have to make it clear, “This is as far as you go, China.” And in terms of their military buildup, it’s real but it would take them about 17 years to build up to where we are. Mr. Yang and then Senator Klobuchar. I have family in Hong Kong. I spent four months there and seeing what’s happening on the streets. It’s shocking. They banned face masks in Hong Kong. Why? Because they have AI technology that now is using facial recognition to identify protesters if they so much as do anything on the street so they can follow up with them and detain them later. This is the rivalry that we have to win where China’s concerned. They’re in the process of leapfrogging us in AI because they have more data than we do and their government is subsidizing it to the tune of tens of billions of dollars. I have sat with our leading technologists and they say they cannot match the Chinese resources. China just produced its first major smartphone that does not have Google apps and it is now trying to export its technology to the rest of the world. What we have to do is build an international coalition to set technology standards and then you can bring the Chinese to the table in a very real way because this is their top priority and this is where we need to out compete them and win. Senator Klobuchar. When it comes to foreign policy, I think we need to keep our promises and keep our threats. And this president has done neither. And a country like China, they’re leaders, they watch that and they know. He has stood with dictators over innocents. He has stood with tyrants over free leaders. He does it all the time. And I have a little different take than some of my colleagues when it comes to what happened at that conference with NATO. Yeah, they were making fun of him, some of the foreign leaders. I’ve heard senators make more fun of other senators than that. The point of it was that he couldn’t even tolerate it. He is so thin skinned that he walked, he quit. America doesn’t quit. So if we want to send a message to the Chinese, we stand with our allies. We stand with them firmly. We have a very clear and coherent foreign policy when it comes to human rights. Check out my website, amyklobuchar.com. I have the five R’s of our foreign policy. About reasserting our values, rejoining international agreements, like the Iranian nuclear agreement. But it all comes down to one R, returning to sanity. Mayor Buttigieg and then we’re going to take a break. I’m actually not worried about the president’s bad sense of humor when it comes to being made fun of. I’m worried about the fact that he is echoing the vocabulary of dictators around the world. When the American president refers to unfavorable press coverage as the product of the enemy of the people, democracy around the world gets weaker. Freedom of the press, not just here at home but around the world, gets weaker. It’s one more reminder of what is at stake, not just here at home, but for world history, in the imperative that we win this election. This is our chance. Very brief. Very brief. Okay. I just want to make very clear, Mayor, that the freedom of the press is deep in my heart. My dad was a newspaper man. And I am the one that asked every attorney general candidate we’ve had under Donald Trump, both of whom I opposed, about their respect for the First Amendment. And they have refused to follow the rules that Attorney General Holder put in place when it came to protecting our journalists. They would not commit that they wouldn’t put a journalist in jail for doing their job. So this is not just talking points to me, this is the real world. And I think that experience that I will bring to The White House with protecting the First Amendment is worth more than any talking points. Politico Democratic Presidential Debate. I’m Judy Woodruff, joined by my PBS Newshour colleagues Amna Nawaz and Yamiche Alcindor, by Tim Alberta of Politico. Now, let’s turn to the next question from Tim. Thank you, Judy. Candidates, let’s make things interesting. Former President Obama said this week when asked who should be running countries that if women were in charge, you’d see a significant improvement on just about everything. He also said quote, “If you look at the world and look at the problems, it’s usually old people, usually old men, not getting out of the way. Senator Sanders, you are the oldest candidate on stage. And I’m white as well. Yes. Well, I got a lot of respect for Barack Obama. I think I disagree with him on this one. Maybe a little self-serving, but I do disagree. Here is the issue. The issue is where power resides in America and it’s not white or black or male or female. We are living in a nation increasingly becoming an oligarchy, where you have a handful of billionaires who spend hundreds of millions of dollars buying elections and politicians. You have more income and wealth inequality today than at any time since the 1920s. We are the only major country on earth, not to guarantee healthcare for all people, which is why we need Medicare for all. We are facing an existential crisis of climate change. The issue is not old or young, male or female. The issue is working people standing up, taking on the billionaire class, and creating a government and an economy that works for all, not just the 1%. Thank you, Senator Sanders. Vice President Biden, I’m going to guess that President Obama did not clear that remark through your campaign ahead of time. I’m going to guess he wasn’t talking about me either. Okay. Look, I’m running because I’ve been around. All my experience. With experience, hopefully, comes judgment and a little bit of wisdom. The fact is that we’re in a position now, the next president of the United States is going to inherit two things. Economy that is out of kilter and a domestic policy that needs to be used where we have to unite America and a foreign policy that requires somebody to be able on day one, stand up, look out the entire world, know who that person is, know what they stand for and know they know them. And that’s the reason I’m running. I have more experience in doing that than anybody on this stage. Just to follow up, Vice president Biden, if elected, you would turn 82 at the end of your first term. You’d be the oldest president in American history. [crosstalk 00:03:14] Churchill. Are you willing to commit … American history. Oh, American history. Yes. I was joking. It was a joke. Okay. I appreciate it. Politico doesn’t have much of a sense of humor. Oh, we’ve got a great sense of humor. They wouldn’t have put me on stage otherwise. No, I’m not willing to commit one way or another. Here’s the deal. I’m not even elected one term yet and let’s see where we are. But it’s a nice thought. Senator Klobuchar, you had your hand raised. Thank you for asking a woman this question. First of all, we have not had enough women in our government. When I was on Trevor Noah’s show once, I explained how in the history of the Senate, there was something like 2000 men and only 50 women in the whole history and he said if a nightclub had numbers that bad, they would shut it down. However, it is not just about numbers. It’s about what you get done. And that is my argument. If you look at the poll at the state that knows me best, and that is the state of Minnesota, it showed in the state that Hillary had her lowest margin of victory. It showed that I beat Donald Trump by 18 points. I beat him with men more than anyone on this stage. And I am someone that has passed over 100 bills, with men and women, with Republicans and with Democrats, including changing the sexual harassment laws for the United States Congress. A bill I led, so taxpayers are no longer going to have to pay for people that harass other people. I have passed the law for drug shortages. I have done work in our rural areas. I think that’s what most matters to people. I would be so proud to be the first woman president, but mostly I want to be a president that gets things done and improves people’s lives. Thank you Senator Klobuchar. Senator Warren, you would be the oldest president ever inaugurated. I’d like you to weigh in as well. E. I’d also be the youngest woman ever inaugurated. I believe that President Obama was talking about who has power in America, whose voices get heard. I believe he’s talking about women and people of color and trans people and people whose voices just so often get shoved out. And for me, the best way to understand that is to look at how people are running their campaigns in 2020. I made the decision when I decided to run not to do business as usual. And now I’m crowding in on 100,000 selfies. That’s 100,000 hugs and handshakes and stories. Stories from people who are struggling with student loan debt, stories from people who can’t pay their medical bills, stories from people who can’t find childcare. Now, most of the people on the stage run a traditional campaign and that means going back and forth from coast to coast to rich people and people who can put up 5,000 bucks or more in order to have a picture taken, in order to have a conversation, and in order maybe to be considered to be an ambassador. Thank you, Senator Warren. E. No, I want to finish this. Those selfies cost nobody anything. And I get it. In a democracy, we all have a lot of different points of view and everybody gets one vote. But here’s the thing, people who can put down $5,000 to have a picture taken, don’t have the same priorities as people who are struggling with student loan debt or struggling to pay off medical debt. I’m running a campaign where people whose voices get heard. We can’t have people who can put down $5,000 for a check, drown out the voices of everyone else. They don’t in my campaign and they won’t in my white house. Thank you, Senator Warren. Mayor Buttigieg, you had your hand raised. I can’t help but feel that might’ve been directed at me and here’s the thing. We’re in the fight of our lives right now. Donald Trump and his allies have made it abundantly clear that they will stop at nothing, not even foreign interference, to hold on to power. They’ve already put together more than $300 million. This is our chance. This is our only chance to defeat Donald Trump. And we shouldn’t try to do it with one hand tied behind our back. The way we’re going to win is to bring everybody to our side in this fight. If that means that you’re a grad student digging deep to go online to peteforamerica.com and chip in 10 bucks, that’s great. And if you can drop $1,000 without blinking, that’s great too. We need everybody’s help in this fight. I’m not going to turn away anyone who wants to help us defeat Donald Trump. We need Democrats who’ve been with us all along, yes, but we also need independents worried about the direction of the country. If you were Republican, disgusted with what’s going on in your own party, we’re not going to agree on everything, but we need you in this fight and I will welcome you to our side. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Senator Warren, 45 seconds to respond. E. So, the mayor just recently had a fundraiser that was held in a wine cave full of crystals and served $900 a bottle wine. Think about who comes to that. He had promised that every fundraiser he would do would be open door, but this one was closed door. We made the decision many years ago that rich people in smoke-filled rooms would not pick the next president of the United States. Billionaires in wine caves should not pick the next president of the United States. Mr. Mayor, your response. You know, according to Forbes magazine, I am literally the only person on this stage who’s not a millionaire or a billionaire. This is important. This is the problem with issuing purity tests, you cannot yourself pass. If I pledge never to be in the company of a progressive democratic donor, I couldn’t be up here. Senator, your net worth is 100 times mine. Now, supposing that you went home feeling the holiday spirit, I know this isn’t likely but stay with me, and decided to go on to Pete for america.com and give the maximum allowable by law $2,800. Would that pollute my campaign because it came from a wealthy person? No. I would be glad to have that support. We need the support from everybody who is committed to helping us defeat Donald Trump. We would like to bring another one, but obviously Senator Warren, I’d like to give you a chance to respond. E. I do not sell access to my time. I don’t do call-time with millionaires and billionaires. Hold on a sec. Sorry, as it went Senator- E. I don’t meet behind closed doors with big dollar donors and look, I’ve taken one that ought to be an easy step for everyone here. I’ve said to anyone who wants to donate to me, if you want to donate to me, that’s fine, but don’t come around later expecting to be named ambassador because that’s what goes on in these high dollar fundraisers. I said no and I asked everybody on this stage to join me. This ought to be an easy step and here’s the problem. If you can’t stand up and take the steps that are relatively easy, can’t stand up to the wealthy and well-connected when it’s relatively easy when you’re a candidate, then how can the American people believe you’re going to stand up to the wealthy and well-connected when you’re president and it’s really hard. Senator, I’ve got to respond to this. Mr. Mayor, we’re going to give you one more chance to respond. First of all, if you can’t say no to a donor, then you have no business running for office in the first place. But also, Senator, your presidential campaign right now as we speak, is funded in part by money you transferred, having raised it at those exact same big ticket fundraisers you now denounce. Did it corrupt you, Senator? Of course not. So, to denounce the same kind of fundraising guidelines that president Obama went by, that Speaker Pelosi goes by, that you yourself went by until not long ago in order to build the democratic party and build a campaign ready for the fight of our lives, these purity tests shrink the stakes of the most important election upon us. We’d like to bring everyone in. We’d like to bring everyone in. E. He addressed me directly. I did not come here to listen to this argument. I came here to make a case for progress and I have never even been to a wine cave. I’ve been to the Wind Cave in South Dakota, which I suggest you go to. So, what is making a case for progress about? That is what unites us up here instead of what divides us, which is campaign finance reform. That means passing a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United. It means making the first bill we pass when I am president will be HR1 which is the ethics reform passed in the house, which is currently sitting on Mitch McConnell’s desk along with 400 bills. And if you don’t think we can get this done, well we can, but only if we win this election big. Not by arguing with each other but by finding what united us in getting it done. I came to make a case for progress. Thank you, Senator Klobuchar. Senator Sanders. I am rather proud, maybe, I don’t know. The only candidate up here doesn’t have any billionaire contributions, but you know what I do have? We have received more contributions from more individuals than any candidate in the history of the United States of America at this point in an election, averaging $18 a piece. Now there’s a real competition going on up here. My good friend Joe, and he is a good friend, he’s received contributions from 44 billionaires. Pete, on the other hand is trailing. Pete, you only got 39 billionaires contributing. So Pete, we look forward to you. I know you’re an energetic guy and a competitive guy to see if you could take on Joe on that issue. But what is not a laughing matter, my friends. This is why three people own more wealth than the bottom half. This is why Amazon and other major corporations pay zero in federal taxes. We need to get money out of politics. We should run our campaigns on that basis. Thank you, Senator Sanders. Vice President Biden. 45 seconds to respond. My average contribution is $43, number one. That’s number one. Number two, the idea that the senator’s suggesting that I’m in the pocket of billionaires, when in fact they oppose everything that I’ve ever done and continue to do. I have made sure from the very beginning, every one of my fundraisers is open to the press. Every single solitary one, not one single time period. And I’ve made sure that you know exactly where all the … and the largest contribution I’ve accepted is $2,800, which is allowed under the law. And I’m the first person to introduce the constitutional amendment to make sure that there is now all public funding of elections. End all private funding. And we all should make a commitment of that right now on this stage. In the meantime, you got to fund a campaign and we in fact have funded a campaign average contribution, $43. Thank you, vice president. [crosstalk 00:15:58] I would like to bring you in. Listen, I’m running because this government is broken because it’s purchased by corporations and I’ve spent 10 years fighting those corporations and beating them and building grassroots organizations to push power down to the people. That’s what I’ve been doing for a decade. But let me say this, there’s someone who’s loving this conversation and his name is Donald Trump. That’s right. We know how he’s going to run. He’s told us last week, he looked at a group of Americans and said, “I don’t like you. You don’t like me. It doesn’t matter. You’re going to support me because the Democrats will destroy the economy in 15 minutes.” We need to go after this guy. He’s a different breed of cat and we need to beat him and we need to talk about prosperity. And I spent 25 years building a business. We’re going to have to take him on the economy, not have these kinds of conversations and tear each other down, but actually go after this corrupt president and beat him on the economy where he thinks he’s king and where in fact he’s a fraud and a failure. Thank you Mr. Steyer. We’re going to end it there. I want to turn now to an issue that’s been in the headlines quite a bit and that is immigration. Mr. Yang, we have a question here from a professor right here at Loyola Marymount. There are nearly 200,000 DACA recipients, so-called DREAMers, in the state of California more than any other state, including several students right here at LMU. If you win and you reinstate DACA through executive action, another president could just overturn it again. Of course, I would. I’m the son of immigrants myself and I know that DREAMers are essentially Americans in everything but this legal classification. I just want to return to this conversation because I think it’s core. Our country is deeply misogynist and most all of us know that. Money and men are tied together. That’s where I thought Elizabeth was taking the conversation. The fact is, strong societies would elect more female leaders. Strong men treat women well for the same reasons. I’m on the record saying that you need both strong men and female leaders in government because the fact is if you get too many men alone and leave us alone for a while, we kind of become morons. So, it’s related to our campaign finance rules because right now the fact is we operate in a fundamentally anti-woman marketplace, and that includes the marketplace for politicians. If we were to put a hundred democracy dollars into the hands of every American voter, instead of 5% contributing, you’d see that rate skyrocket to 50 or 60% and you’d have many, many more women who would run for office because they don’t have to go shake the money tree in the wine cave. Thank you Mr. Yang. I’d like to follow up. The question again, Mr. Was about DREAMers. You pledge to move on a permanent legislative fix in your first 100 days. DREAMers say that they are frustrated by Democrats’ failure to prioritize their status in deal after deal. I believe everyone on this stage would do the right thing by DREAMers in the first hundred days. I would make it a top priority. I’m the son of immigrants myself. The fact is almost half of fortune 500 companies were started by an immigrant or children of immigrants. Immigrants make our country stronger and more dynamic. And immigrants are being scapegoated for issues they have absolutely nothing to do with. If you go to the factory in Michigan, it’s not wall to wall immigrants. It’s wall to wall robot arms and machines. We have to send the opposite message of this administration and, as your a president, I think I could send a very clear message, where if you’re considering immigrating to this country and I’m the president, you would realize my son or daughter can become president of the United States. That’s the opposite of the current administration and that’s the message I would love to send to the world. Thank you, Mr. Yang. Senator Sanders, I have a new question for you. You can respond to Mr. Yang’s comments as well. This is related, sir, but there are estimated to be as many as 12 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S. More than 2 million right here in California. No. This is what I would do. Day one executive order restore the legal status of 1.8 million young people in the DACA program. Day one we change border policy so that federal agents will never snatch babies from the arms of their mothers. Day one. Day one we introduce bipartisan legislation, which will, in fact, be comprehensive, which will result in a path toward citizenship for all of the 11 million who are undocumented. That is what the people of our country want. Trump thinks mistakenly that he is going to win reelection by dividing us up. We are going to win this election by bringing our people together, black and white and Latino, Native American, Asian American. That’s what this campaign is about. That’s what America must be about. Senator Klobuchar. Thank you. I started my day today with a group of immigrants who are there talking to me about housing and I thought about this president and what he’s done. He has used our immigrants as political pawns. Every single day, he tries to draw a wedge. I will be a different president. My view on this comes from experience. When I got to the Senate, Senator Kennedy asked me to be one of the two new senators that was in the group to work on the immigration reform package. We got so close to passing that. I voted for it. Not everyone did, but most of the Democrats did. Then I was on the judiciary committee when President Obama was president and we worked very hard on that immigration reform. We actually passed that with Republican votes. Then I was in the small group that worked on the compromise on the DREAMers, that would have solved that problem. We didn’t get that done because this president gut-punched us. Thank you, Senator. I will take my views. I will take this experience. I will get this done because immigrants don’t diminish America. They are America. Thank you, Senator. Mr. Steyer, briefly, your response. Listen, I think it’s important to note that this president is not against immigration. He’s against immigration by non-white people. Yes. This is his attempt to divide us, as Senator Sanders said, on race. And that’s what he’s been doing since the very first day he started running for president. He’s been vilifying non-white people. He’s been trying to inflame his base and scare them that if in fact white people lose control of this country, that they’re going to lose control of their lives. And as somebody who lives in a majority-minority state, which is California, what he’s doing is so wrong on so many different levels. I agree with Senator Sanders. We have to reframe this argument completely. We have to go back to the idea that every American is worth being a full human being on every right. This is a racial argument by a racist president who’s trying to divide us and who’s vilifying people. It’s absolutely wrong and it’s led him to break the laws of humanity in our name. Thank you, Mr. Steyer. Mayor Buttigieg, a new question to you, Mr. Mayor. You said last month that the U.S. owes compensation to children separated from their families at the Southern border. The consensus among child welfare experts is that those thousands of children will likely suffer lifelong trauma as a result of that separation. Yes, and they should have a fast track to citizenship because what the United States did under this president to them was wrong and we have a moral obligation to make right what was broken. And on the larger issue of immigration, my understanding of this issue isn’t theoretical. It’s not something I formed in committee rooms in Washington. It begins with the fact that my household, my family came from abroad. My father immigrated to this country and became a U.S. Citizen. It comes from the fact that I’m the mayor of a city where neighborhoods that were left for dying are now coming back to life, largely because of the contributions mainly of Latino immigrants. …Largely because of the contributions mainly of Latino immigrants. And I’ve seen those same neighborhoods shut down. Families huddling in church, panicking just because of the rumor of an ice raid that does not make our country safe. Could I respond. Just to look into the eyes of an eight year old boy whose father was deported even though he had nothing so much as a traffic ticket against his name and try to think of something to tell that boy because I couldn’t tell him what he most wanted to hear, which is just that he was going to have his dad back. How can harming that young man possibly make America safer. Mr. When I am president? Based on those experiences, I will make sure that this is a country of laws and of values and that means not only ending these unspeakable frugal practices at the border, but finally and truly fixing the immigration system that has needed, a full overhaul since the 1980s. Mr. Mayor. We cannot wait four years, 10 years. We cannot wait anymore to do something about this. Thank you Mr. Mayor. I support H.R. 40 which is the bill that has been proposed in Congress to establish a commission to look at reparations, but we shouldn’t wait for that commission to do its work to do things that are reparative. Remember we’re not talking about a gift to anybody. We’re talking about mending what was broken. We’re talking about the generational theft of the wealth of generations of African Americans. And just crossing out or racist policy and replacing it with a neutral one is not enough to deliver a quality harms compound just like a dollar saved in its value compounds over time. So does the value of a dollar stolen and that is why the United States must act immediately with investments in minority owned businesses with investments in health equity, with investments in HBCUs and on the longer term a look at reparations so that we can mend what has been broken. Not any, since I haven’t spoken on this. Got a chance. Number one, the reason we’re the country we are is because of immigration. We’ve been able to cherry-pick the best from every single continent. The people that come here have determination, resilience. They are ready to stand up and work like the devil. We had a 24 out of every 100 children in our school today is Hispanic. The idea that we are going to walk away and not provide every opportunity for them is not only stupid and immoral but as bad for America. They are the future of America and we should invest in them. Everybody will be benefit from it. Every single American and you should get used to it. This is a nation of immigrants. That’s who we are. That’s why we are who we are. That’s what makes us different and we should invest in them. Thank you Mr. Biden. Senator Klobuchar, sorry you had your hand up. I was hearkening back… I made my case on immigration to what the mayor said about Washington. So I look at this a different way. When we were in the last debate mayor, you basically mocked the 100 years of experience on the stage and what do I see on this stage? I see Elizabeth’s work starting the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and helping 29 million people. I see the vice president’s work in getting a $2 billion for his cancer moonshot. I see Senator Sanders’ work working to get the veterans bill passed across the aisle and I see what I’ve done, which is to negotiate three farm bills and be someone that actually had major provisions put in those bills. So what you can dismiss committee hearings. I think this experience works and I have not denigrated your experience as a local official. You know, sorry. I just think you should respect our experience when you look at how you evaluate someone who can get things done. Thank you Senator. Mr. Mayor I’ll give you a chance to respond. You actually did denigrate my experience Senator and it was before the break and I was going to let it go cause we got bigger fish to fry here. Oh, I don’t think we have bigger fish to fry than picking a president of the United States. You’re right, and before the break you seemed to imply that my relationship to the First Amendment was a talking point. As if anyone up here has any more or less commitment to the constitution than anybody else up here. Let me tell you about my relationship to the First Amendment. It is part of the Constitution that I raised my right hand and swore to defend with my life. That is my experience and it may not be the same as yours, but it counts, senator, it counts. Thank you Mr. Mayor. Senator Klobuchar this time you have 45 seconds to respond. I certainly respect your military experience. That’s not what this is about. This is about choosing a president and I know my view of this is I know you ran for to be chair of the Democratic National Committee. That’s not something that I wanted to do. I want to be president of the United States. And the point is we should have someone heading up this ticket that has actually won and been able to show that they can gather the support that you talk about of moderate Republicans and Independents as well as a fired-up democratic base. And not just done at once, I have done it three times. I think winning matters. I think a track record of getting things done matters and I also think showing our party that we can actually bring people with us, have a wider tent, have a bigger coalition and yes, longer coattails that matters. Thank you Senator, finished. I’ve got to respond to that. Senator I know that if you just go by vote totals, maybe what goes on in my city seems small to you. If you want to talk about the capacity to win, try putting together a coalition to bring you back to office with 80% of the vote as a gay dude and Mike Pence’s Indiana. [inaudible]. If you had won in Indiana that would be one thing. You tried and you lost by 20 points. Let’s talk about how… Excuse me, let’s talk about how we win an election, which is something everybody here wants to do in terms of defeating the most dangerous president in American history. So let me tell you how you’re win it. You have the largest voter turnout in the history of America. And you don’t have the largest voter turnout unless you create energy and excitement. And you know, create energy and excitement unless you are prepared to take on the people who own America and are prepared to speak to the people who are working in America. We need a progressive agenda. available to all because we have free tuition or intensely Oh student debt in this country. Yamiche A. Thank you Senator Sanders. I’d like to turn to a new subject. And that is of course education. Senator Warren, you propose free public college tuition and student loan forgiveness for most families. Why should wealthy families be able to send their kids to public college for free? Why not concentrate that government help on those most in need? E. So as I’ve talked about before, I have a 2 cent wealth tax proposed for millionaires and billionaires and that gives us enough money to invest in all of our babies age zero to five. To put an historic $800 billion investment in public schools, K through 12 and that will permit us to offer technical school 2-year college, 4-year college for every single person who wants an education. Cancel student loan debt four 50…. Put a $50 billion investment in our historically black colleges and universities and cancel student loan debt for 43 million Americans. E. Look, this is about money, but this is also about values. We need to make an investment in our future and the best way to do that is let’s invest in the public education of our children. That starts when they’re babies and it goes long after high school. We want to have families. I meet families every day in the selfie lines who talk about what it means to be crushed by student loan debt. That’s why I have a proposal, popular among Democrats, popular among Republicans, popular among independents to ask those at the top to pay a little more. So somebody can get rid of that student loan debt so they can make an investment in themselves. Start a small business, buy a car, create a future for themselves and for this country. Yamiche A. Thank you, Senator. I see some hands, but I want to go to Mayor Buttigiege. Mayor Buttigiege, your plan offers free or discounted public college only to families making up to $150,000 a year. I do think that if you’re in that lucky top 10% I still wish you, well, don’t get me wrong, I just want you to go ahead and pay your own tuition. Now we can still have public service loan forgiveness for those who go into lower income fields to deal with that. But if you’re not top 10% I think you’re going to be for the most part. Okay? And there is a very real choice on where every one of these tax dollars goes. So I very much agree with Senator Warren on raising more tax revenue from millionaires and billionaires. I just don’t agree on the part about spending it on millionaires and billionaires when it comes to their college tuition. E. So wait, he mentioned me by name. Yamiche A. Thank you, Mayor. Thank you Mayor Buttigiege, I want to… I’m going to let you respond senator Warren. E. Look, the mayor wants billionaires to pay one tuition for their own kids. I want a billionaire to pay enough to cover tuition for all of our kids because that’s how we build a future. The other part is we’ve got to deal with student loan debt, and right now most of the people on the stage are nibbling around the edges of a huge student loan debt burden that disproportionately affects people of color. African Americans are more likely to have to borrow money to go to school, more likely to borrow more money while they’re in school and have a harder time paying it off. We want to make an investment in the future then open up education for all of our kids. That’s how we build our future. Yamiche A. Thank you senator. Senator Sanders you can nor respond to it. I believe in the concept of universality and one of the crises in America today is people are sick and tired of filling out forms. So you’re not eligible for the program today because you’re at 150 but you’ll lost your job by eligible. You’ve got a better job, you’re eligible. I think what we have to do is what we do with social security, what we do with public education. Donald Trump’s kids can go to a public school, they should be able to go to a public school. What we all need right now is a revolution in education. We have got to en this dysfunctional childcare system and make that every working class person in this country can find high quality, affordable childcare. We need to make public colleges and universities tuition-free. And by taxing billionaires and by taxing wall street, we will cancel all student debt in this country. Yamiche A. Thank you, Senator Sanders. Tim. Switching gears here, Mr.Steyer, earlier this year in Iowa I met a father, Bill stumps and his son Kyle and Dubuque. Kyle is a remarkable young adults with significant disabilities and though he’s been employed for about five years at a local pizza parlor, the future is very uncertain for his family. Bill worries that there aren’t enough jobs, living facilities, social programs designed to meet the needs of his son. Look, the United States has made a commitment to treat everybody equally and that means supporting people with disabilities both in terms of education and later when they’re part of the workforce. That means bringing the resources to bear to make sure that we’re treating them fairly in school and after school to try and integrate them fully and to make them have as full a life as possible. The question we’ve got here across the board is can we afford to do the kinds of things that Senator Sanders and Senator Warren are pushing? And the answer is yes, but in fact what we need to do is to undo the tax breaks that have been given for two generations to rich Americans and big corporations last year the top 400 corporations paid an 11% tax. That is absolutely ludicrous. the answer on disability is a question of focus and money as so many of these questions are, we have a country where the government is broken because corporations have bought it. They’re getting their way and for us to get back to government of by and for the people that serves Americans, including Americans with disabilities. We’re going to have to take that back. Mr. Yang I didn’t hear a specific answer from Mr. Steyer. I would love it. I have a son with special needs and to me special needs is the new normal in this country. How many of you all have a family member or a friend or a neighbor with special needs or autism? If you look around, most hands went up. The fact is right now we have to do more for Kyle. Special needs children are going to become special needs adults in many cases. And here’s the challenge. We go to employers and say, Hey, this special needs person can be a contributor in your workplace, which may be correct, but that’s not the point. We have to stop confusing economic value in human value. We have to be able to say to our kids and Kyle that you have intrinsic value because you are an American and you are a human being. We’re going to put a freedom dividend of $1,000 a month in everyone’s hands, which is going to help families around the country adapt and then we’re going to take this burden off of the communities and off of the schools who do not have the resources to support kids like my son and make it a federal priority, not a local one. So not not robbing Peter to pay Paul. Thank you Mr. Yang. We have to move on. Judy. E. No. Come on. Senator Warren, 45 seconds. E. So I was a special education teacher and I loved that work because it gave me a chance to work straight up with people to recognize the worth of every human being. I had four to 46-year-olds who were in special ed and what do we need to do? That’s why I have a plan as a special ed teacher to fully fund IDEA, so every child with disabilities will get the full education they need. E. My housing plan is about investing in more housing across this country and rural America and urban America in small town America, but it’s also about making sure that people who want to live independently, people who have disabilities will have housing available to them. I make a part of my job to spill that we are going to make sure as president, I will make sure that the people who want to bid on federal contracts are treating people with disabilities fairly and paying them fairly. You’ve got to go at it at every part of what we do because as a nation, this is truly a measure of who we are. We believe in treating these the least of thy brethren as people of value, and that is how we make a better America. Thank you. Senator Warren. Judy. I know we have a lot of hands up. We have so many important topics to discuss. I want to come to you, Senator Klobuchar on a question of the judges. President Trump has appointed, as we know, two Supreme court justices, but he’s also had confirmed nearly 200 federal judges, most of whom are young and could shape American law for decades to come. Some of them you voted for in the Senate, including one who just yesterday joined a ruling to strike down a key part of the affordable care act would president Trump’s appointees, my question is, make it harder for you as president for any of you on this stage to enact your agenda. Of course. And I want to make it clear that I’ve opposed many, many judges and I think everyone will remember what happened at the Kavanaugh Hearing when that nominee went after me. I stood my ground and he had to apologize. So I have been very strong on these judges. As for the judge you just referred to, there was actually the judge that wrote the opinion was a, that went through the Senate unanimously with support by Senator Sanders with support by President Obama with support by then Senator Kennedy. So I think it is very important when we look at these judges to acknowledge that there are some of these judges that you think are going to be okay and they aren’t, but what would I do as president? I would appoint judges that are in the vein of people like Elena Kagan and justice Pryor and Sonia Sotomayor, and let’s not forget the notorious RBG. That’s what I would do. And if you look at my record as a lawyer and a member of the Judiciary committee, look at the judges that I recommended to President Obama. People like Mimi Wright who’s a superstar, and Susan Richard Nelson, look at who I put in as the first openly gay Marshall in the history of the United States. I did that because I knew they were qualified people to take those jobs and you need to do it not only with the right judges and have that knowhow, but you also have to do it right away. That is one thing that we all learn from when president Obama was in and that was that he was dealing with an economic crisis and it was hard to do it right away, but we have to immediately start putting judges on the bench to fill vacancies so that we can reverse the horrific nature of these Trump judges. A followup to mayor Buttigiege. Beyond a pledge not to overturn Roe versus Wade, which I believe all of you have said would be part of your decision making and choosing a nominee to the court. The Supreme court is very personal for me because my household, my marriage, exists by the grace of a single vote on that body, and yes, it is critical that we have justices who understand that American freedom includes reproductive rights and reproductive freedom, but that’s not all. I expect an understanding that voting rights are human rights. I expect an understanding that equality is required of us all and I expect a level of respect for the rule of law that prevents this body from coming to be viewed as just one more partisan battlefield, which is why I will not only appoint judges and justices who reflect this worldview, but also begin moving to reform the body itself as our country has done at least half a dozen times in its history. So that it is not one more political battlefield every single time a vacancy comes up. Yamiche. Yamiche A. Senator Sanders, at least 22 transgender people were killed in the United States this year. Most of them transgender women of color. Each of you have said you would push for the passage of the Equality Act, a comprehensive LGBTQ Civil Rights Bill. We need moral leadership in the white house. We need a president who will do everything humanly possible to end all forms of discrimination against the transgender community, against the African American community, against the Latino community, and against all minorities in this country. But above and beyond providing the moral leadership of trying to bring our people together. What we also need for the transgender community is to make sure that health care is available to every person in this country, regardless of their sexual orientation or their needs. And that is why I strongly support and have helped lead the effort for a Medicare for all single payer program, which will provide comprehensive healthcare to all people, including certainly the transgender community. Yamiche A. Thank you, Senator Sanders. Senator Warren. E. The transgender community has been marginalized in every way possible. And one thing that the president of the United States can do is lift up attention, lift up their voices, lift up their lives. Here’s a promise I made. I will go to the Rose Garden once every year to read the names of transgender women of people of color who have been killed in the past year. I will make sure that we read their names so that as a nation we are forced to address the particular vulnerability on homelessness. I will change the rules now that put people in prison based on their birth sex identification rather than their current identification. I will do everything I can to make sure that we are in America that leaves no one behind. Yamiche A. Thank you senator Warren. Vice president Biden. Let’s turn now to a Afghanistan. Confidential documents published last week by the Washington Post revealed that four years senior us officials misled the public about the war in Afghanistan. Yes sir, Afghanistan. [inaudible 00:23:25]. The reason I can speak to this, it’s well known, if any of you followed my view on Afghanistan, I was sent by the president before we got sworn in to Afghanistan to come back with a report. I said there was comprehensive policy available and then I got in a big fight for a long time with the Pentagon because I strongly opposed the nation building notion. We set about rebuilding that country as a, as a whole nation is beyond our capacity. I argued from the very beginning that we should have a policy that was based on an anti-terrorism policy with a very small footprint that in fact only had special forces to deal with potential threats from that territory to the United States of America. The first thing I would do as president the United States of America is to make sure that we brought all combat troops home and into a negotiation with the Taliban. But I would leave behind special forces in small numbers to be able to deal with the potential threat unless we got a real good negotiation accomplished to deal with terrorism. That’s been my position from the beginning. That’s why I think secretary Gates and some members of the Pentagon weren’t happy with me. Mr. Biden. The question was about your time in the white house though, and in that Washington Post report, there’s a senior national security official who said that there was constant pressure from the Obama white house to produce figures showing the troop surge was working, and I’m quoting from the report here, “Despite hard evidence to the contrary. Since 2009 go back and look, I was on the opposite side of that with the Pentagon. [inaudible 00:50:08] I can speak to it now is because it’s been published. It’s been published thoroughly. I’m the guy, from the beginning, who argued that it was a big, big mistake to surge forces to Afghanistan, period. We should not have done it and I argued against it constantly. In all due respect to Joe. Joe, you’re also the guy who helped lead us into the disastrous war in Iraq. What we need to do, is I think, rethink and the Washington post piece was very educational. What we need to rethink, is the entire war on terror? We have lost thousands of our own men and women, brave soldiers. Hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people, have been killed abroad or forced to leave their countries. It is time right now, that we bring this world together, to try to end these endless wars and address the root causes, which are causing these wars. Senator Sanders, you do often point to your vote against the war in Iraq is evidence of your judgment on foreign policy. But you did vote for the war in Afghanistan and as recently as 2015 you said you supported a continued U. S. Troop presence there. Well, only one person, my good friend Barbara Lee was right on that issue. She was the only person in the house to vote against the war in Afghanistan. She was right, I was wrong. So was everybody else in the house. But to answer your question, I don’t think you do what Trump does and make foreign policy decisions based on a tweet at 3:00 AM in the morning or dessert your long time allies like the Kurds. I think you work with the international community, you remove all troops over a period of time, a short period of time within one year. Thank you, Senator. Mayor Buttigieg, you served in this war, but I want to ask about your decision making if you were elected Commander in Chief. You have pledged to withdrawal all U.S. troops from a Afghanistan within your first year as president. But the Taliban today control or contest more than half the country. So should you, as president, still withdrawal all those U. S. Troops if the country could once again become a Haven for terrorists. We’re going to leave one way or the other. The question is to make sure we do it well and not poorly. And of course that has to respond to the conditions on the ground and the need for a political settlement. But the other day I was reunited with somebody that I served with over there and the thing we were, marveling at is how long it’s been since we left. I thought I was one of the last troops turning out the lights when I left years ago and we’re still there. There may need to be some kind of limited special operations and intelligence capacity. The exact same kind of thing by the way that we actually had in Syria, holding the line before the president yanked it out leading to the road to chaos. But what we know is that we cannot go on with these endless wars. And I’m glad that the name of Barbara Lee was mentioned, not only because of what she’s talked about years ago. I believe that we had no choice but to go to Afghanistan after 9/11 but right now, she is one of the leaders of the effort to repeal and replace the authorization for the use of military force and the folks that I served with deserve that. They deserve the clarity of members of Congress being able to summon the courage, to take an up or down vote on whether they ought to be there in the first place and when I am president, anytime if I am forced to deploy troops into war, anytime we seek an authorization, it will have a three year sunset. So that if there really does have to be a conversation about extending it, it has to be brought to Congress, brought to the American people, and those members of Congress have to take that tough up or down vote. Thank you Mr mayor. Tim. Thanks. Moving to healthcare. An issue that voters tell us every day is still the number one priority for them. Senator Sanders, you’ve spent plenty of time discussing and defending the merits of your Medicare for all plan. But the reality is that, if Republicans retain control of the U S Senate or even if Democrats win back a narrow Senate majority, your plan as constituted probably would not have the votes to pass Congress. Well Tim, at a time when we’re spending twice as much per capita on healthcare as any other nation. When 87 million people are uninsured or under insured. When 30,000 people are dying each year because they don’t get to a doctor when they should and what a half a million people are going bankrupt because of the dysfunctional and cruel system that we currently have. You know what? I think we will pass a Medicare for all, single payer system. And I will introduce that legislation in my first week in office. Now to answer your question, I think when we go out to the American people and tell them, that right now, we have got to take on the greed and corruption of the pharmaceutical industry, for example. Which in some cases charges us 10 times more for the same exact drug as it’s charged in this country. Where the American people understand that Medicare for all expands Medicare to cover home health care, dental care, eyeglasses, and hearing AIDS and does it at a cost far, far lower than what some of my opponents are talking about. You know what? We’re going to have the American people behind us. We will have Congress behind it. [crosstalk 00:06:07] Thank you. Senator Sanders, Vice President Biden. I’d like to bring you in. You spent an awful lot of time 10 years ago trying to pass a bill, far less ambitious than what Senator Sanders is talking about here. I don’t think it is realistic, but let me explain why. I introduced a plan to build on Obamacare. It remind everybody, 20 million people got insurance, didn’t have it before. All people with preexisting conditions are able to be covered. I could go on. We didn’t get all that we wanted, but now that it’s been exposed, that taking it away has such dire consequences. I’ve added to the Obamacare plan, the Biden Initiative, which is a public option. Medicare, if you want to have Medicare.for reducing significantly the price of drugs, deductibles, et cetera by underwriting the plan to a tune of about $750 billion dollars. And making sure that we’re able to cover everyone who is in fact able to be covered. It, put your hand down for a second Bernie. Okay. Just Waving to you Joe. I know. So look, it covers everybody. It’s realistic and most importantly, it lets you choose what you want. Here you have 160 million people have negotiated their healthcare plans with their employer. Like many of you had. You may or may not like it. If you don’t like it, you can move into the public option that I proposed in my plan. But if you like it, you shouldn’t have Washington dictating you. You can not keep the plan you have. Thank you. Vice president Biden. [crosstalk 00:57:38] Senator Sanders, 45 seconds to respond. Under Joe’s plan essentially, we retain the status quo. That’s not true. That is exactly true. Thank you. And by the way, Joe, under your plan, you asked me how are we going to pay for it? Under your plan I’ll tell you how we’re paying for right now. The average worker in America, their family makes 60,000 a year. That family is now paying $12,000 a year for health care. 20% of the income or the Medicare for all that family will be paying $1,200 a year because we’re eliminating the profiteering of the drug companies and the insurance companies and ending, there’s Byzantine and complex administration of thousands of separate healthcare plans. [crosstalk 00:58:32] 45 seconds for Vice President Biden. I’m the only guy that’s not interrupted here. All right, I’m going to interrupt now. It costs 30 trillion dollars. Let’s get that straight. $30 trillion over 10 years. Some say it costs 20 trillion. Some say it cost 40. The idea that you’re going to be able to save that person making $60,000 a year on Medicare for all is absolutely preposterous. 16% of the American public is on Medicare now and everybody has a tax taken out of their paycheck now. Tell me, you’re going to add 84% more and it’s not going to be higher taxes, at least before he was honest about it. It’s going to increase personal taxes. That’s right. We all got to increase personal taxes, but we’re eliminating premiums, we’re eliminating copayments, we’re eliminating deductibles, we’re eliminating all out of pocket expenses and no family in America will spend more than $200 a year on prescription drugs. It’s first time I did this. Okay, that’s true. I’ll say this. First of all, Bernie, I promise when I am your president, I will get our pharmaceutical bills done and we have worked together on this time and time again and I agree with you on that. But where I disagree is, I just don’t think anyone has a monopoly on bold ideas. I think you can be progressive and practical at the same time. That is why I favor a public option, which is a nonprofit option to bring the cost down and yes, it does bring the cost down immediately for 13 million people and then we’ll expand coverage to 12 million people. But here’s the political problem. This fight that you guys are having isn’t real. Your fight, Bernie is not with me or with Vice President Biden. It is with all those, bunch of those new house members. Not everyone by any means, that got elected in that last election in the democratic party. It is with the new governor, democratic governor of Kentucky that wants to build on Obamacare. And the way I look at it, if you want to cross a river over some trouble waters, you build a bridge, you don’t blow one up. And I think we should build on the affordable care act. She took my name in vain. She hurt my feelings. 45 seconds Senator Sanders. All right. My fight, Amy, it’s not with the governor of Kentucky. My fight and all of our fights must be with the greed and corruption of the pharmaceutical industry. With the greed and corruption of the insurance industry. These guys last year made $100 billion in profit and tens of millions of Americans cannot afford to go to a doctor tonight. The day has got to come and Joe is not talking about it. Amy is not talking about it. The day has got to come and I will bring that day about what we finally say that the drug companies and the insurance companies, the function of health care is that provided for all of our people in a cost effective way, not to make massive profits for the drug companies and the insurance companies. We’d like to bring you into this discussion. The same question to you that I posed to Senator Sanders. If Congress rejects a Medicare for all proposal and you’re the president, are there smaller specific measures that you could pursue with bipartisan support to decrease costs and expand coverage? E. So this is about costs. It’s about costs on middle class families. Last year, 36 million Americans didn’t have a prescription filled because they couldn’t afford it. And those are people with health insurance as well. People who can’t do the copays, people who can’t do the deductibles. People who find out that the drug is not covered. So here’s how I approach this. I want to do the most good I can for the most people as quickly as possible. On day one, I’m going to attack the prices on commonly used drugs like Epipens and insulin and bring down those prices. E. The president can do that. I love saying this all by herself and I will do it. That’s going to save families hundreds of millions of dollars and then in the first hundred days, because I found a way to pay for full healthcare coverage for everyone, without raising taxes on middle class families. I’m going to make available to people for a full healthcare coverage for 135 million people. It’ll be at no cost at all and they can opt into that system. For others. It will be at a low cost. We have got to start moving and move fast [crosstalk 00:01:03:36] and do that. We can do that on 50 votes. Thank you Senator. We are coming to the end of our time. A lot of hands up. We apologize for that, but in the spirit of the season, I’d like to ask each one of you, is there someone else among these candidates that you would have, you have two options. One, a candidate from whom you would ask forgiveness for something, maybe that was said tonight or another time. Or a candidate to whom you would like to give a gift and I’m going to start with you, Mr. Yang. Wow. E. We can do a labor action and just all go on strike on this one Andrew. I don’t think I have much to ask forgiveness for or you all can correct me on this. In terms of a gift, Elizabeth has done me the honor of starting to read my book. I would love to give each of you a copy of my book. It’s about how we’re going through the greatest economic transformation in our country’s history, the fourth industrial revolution. It is grinding up our communities and D.C. Is out to lunch on this. Our media organizations are not covering it adequately. I wrote a book on it and if you like data, this book is for you. This goes for the people at home too. If you like data and books. Well, first of all, I love data and books, so I think we should all be excited about this. And come to think of it, I should probably send my book around more to. Look. I think all of us want the same thing at the end of the day. We know what a gift it would be to the future and to the country for literally anybody up here to become president of The United States compared to what we’ve got. And we got to remember there. I don’t know how many, now we’re up to 25 something, have run for president in the democratic party. The moment we’ve got a nominee, the 24 who aren’t that nominee are going to have to rally around the one who does. Let’s make sure there’s not too much to ask for forgiveness for by the time that day comes. Senator Warren? E. I will ask for forgiveness. I know that sometimes I get really worked up and sometimes I get a little hot. I don’t really mean to. What happens is when you do 100,000 selfies with people you hear enough stories about people who are really down to their last moments. I met someone just last week in Nevada, who said that he has diabetes and that he has access to a prescription because he’s a veteran. But his sister has diabetes, his daughter has diabetes, and they simply can’t afford insulin. So the three of them spend all of their time figuring out how to stretch one insulin prescription among three people. When I think about what we could do if we get a majority in the house, a majority in the Senate, and get back the white house, we could make this country work for people like that man. And that’s why I’m in this fight. Vice President Biden? E. I think everyone up here on this stage, and those are not on the stage who’ve run, we owe them because they’re all pushing for the same exact thing. You’re not the only one that does Senator. I’ve done thousands of them. And the crew that follows me can tell you there’s not one line I go through. I don’t have at least to have a dozen people come up and hug me and say, can you help me? I just lost my daughter 10 days ago. Can you help me? Tell me am I going to be okay? Can you help me? I just lost [inaudible] and they’d go and lay out their problems. My wife and I have a call list of somewhere between 20 and a hundred people that we call at least every week or every month to tell them I’m here. E. I give them my private phone number. They keep in touch with me. A little kid who says, (stuttering) I can’t talk. What do I do? I have scores of these young women and men who I keep in contact with. And the reason I would give everyone here at gift is because they want to do something like I do, of making their lives better because there’s a lot of people who are hurting very, very, very badly. Well, I can give out any one of four books that I wrote. But I think the gift that all of us need to give to the American people is a very different vision of the reality of the Trump administration. And the vision that we need to bring forth, is to create a government and a nation based on love and compassion, not greed and hatred. We need a vision which says that in our great country, all of our people should be able to earn a decent standard of living, have health care, have the ability to send their kids to college regardless of their income. So we need a new vision, which brings our people together. Around an agenda that works for all, not the Trump vision of dividing us up to benefit the billionaire class. That’s my vision. Senator Klobuchar. Well, I’d ask for forgiveness anytime any of you get mad at me. I can be blunt, but I am doing this because I think it is so important to pick the right candidate here. I do. I think when you see what’s going on around the country, yes, it’s the economic check that Elizabeth and Bernie have so well pointed out on this stage, but there’s something else going on here and it is a decency check. It is a values check. It is a patriotism check. When you see people, and we’ve all had this happen, that come to our meetings and say yeah, I voted for Donald Trump but I don’t want to do it again because I want my kids to be able to watch the president on TV and not mute the TV. We have to remember as Democrats, and if I get worked up about this, it’s because I believe it’s so much in my heart, that we have to bring people with us and not shut them out. That is the gift we can give America in this election. So, look, this is the holiday season and what I’m hearing from every single one of these candidates is that they’ve gone around the United States and what they’ve seen from this administration and what they’ve seen from the Republican party is cruelty towards the people of the United States for money. So when I think about the gift that I’d like to give, and I’ve seen that too. I mean I think it starts with cruelty. When children are born and it goes right through life into pre-K, education, health care, a living wage, there is cruelty to working people, there’s cruelty to seniors. And so the gift that I’d like to give everyone on this stage, which was the original question, is the gift of teamwork. Because the question up here is, how are we together going to change this framework? How are we together, going to beat this corrupt and criminal president? How are we going to stand up for the people of the United States together? Not by tearing each other down, but by supporting each other and by realizing that what we stand for is the true value of America. And as a team that’s how we’re going to do it. And as Americans, we’re going to come together to stand up for the original values, freedom, equality, justice, teamwork. We are going to take a very short break. That does conclude our questions tonight here at Loyola Marymount university. We’ll be back in just two minutes to hear the candidates closing statements. Welcome back to the PBS news hour Democratic debate with Politico and now it’s time for closing statements. Each have 60 seconds beginning with Mr. Steyer. I’m different from everybody else on this stage and here’s why, I’m running because corporations have bought our government and we need to return power to the people. And for the last 10 years, that’s exactly what I’ve been doing, taking on unchecked corporate power. That’s why I’m for term limits, because if we’re going to have bold change, then we need new people in charge and new ideas. I’m the only person on this stage who’s built a large, multi billion dollar international business. I know how to grow prosperity. I can take on Mr. Trump on the economy and beat him. I’m the only one on this stage who said climate is my number one priority. It’s a crisis we have to deal with, but it’s also our greatest opportunity to create millions of good paying union jobs across the country and clean up the air and water and the black and brown communities where it’s so essential. So if you want to break the corporate stranglehold, beat Mr. Trump on the economy and solve our climate crisis. Mr. Yang. and I’m asking for your vote. Sorry, my apology for interrupting. Mr. Yang. I know what you’re thinking. Our campaign is growing all the time because we are laser focused on solving the real problems that got Donald Trump elected in the first place. I spent seven years helping create thousands of jobs in Detroit, Baltimore, New Orleans and other cities, serving as an ambassador of entrepreneurship under President Obama, and I saw firsthand what many of you already know, our country is falling apart. Our senior citizens are working until the day they die. Our kids are addicted to smartphones or drugs. We’re seeing record high levels of depression, suicides, overdoses. Our companies are recording record profits while our people are literally dying younger. Our way of life is changing faster than ever. And the simple fact is this, our politicians in D C succeed whether we the people succeed or fail. Washington DC today is the richest city in our country. What do they produce? Bad decisions? We need to get the money out of DC and into your hands, the hands of the American people. Join us in Yang2020.com and help us rewrite the rules of the 20th century economy to work for us. We have had quite a debate tonight, but I want to debate Donald Trump. This primary comes down to some simple questions. Who has the best ideas, the best experience, mostly, who can beat Donald Trump and how will she do it? So Donald Trump built his fortune on over time, over $413 million that he got from his Dad. My Grandpa, he was an iron ore miner, a union member who worked 1500 feet underground, and he saved money in a coffee can in the basement to send my Dad to a community college. That’s my family trust. And I figure if you are given opportunity, you don’t go into the world with a sense of entitlement. You go into it with a sense of obligation. An obligation to lift people up instead of hoarding what you have for yourself. Our politics right now because of Donald Trump are toxic. We need a leader who can bring people together and who can win that way. So if you are tired of the extremes in our politics and the noise and the nonsense, you have a home with me. If you want a bigger tent and a wider coalition and longer coattails, join me. We will win at amyklobuchar. Thank you. So the nominee is going to have to do two things, defeat Donald Trump, and unite the country as president. It’s a tall order. And in order to do it, we’re going to need a nominee and a president who can respond to the crisis of belonging that is gripping our nation today. That means building up a politics that is defined, not by who we exclude, not by who we reject, but by how many people we can call to this side. I have seen so many people capable of forming that multiracial, multi generational coalition and I’m seeing more and more people who maybe have not felt welcome in the Democratic party before, but belong here now, because they’re definitely not on board with what’s going on in the Trump white house. I am asking you to join me, to vote for me to caucus for me and to help us build that future defined not by exclusion but by belonging. Senator Warren E. Did you call my name? This is a dark moment in America and yet I come here tonight with a heart filled with hope. All three of my brothers served in the military. They’re all retired. They’re all back in Oklahoma. One is a Democrat, two are Republicans. But you know what unites my three brothers Amazon, they are furious that Amazon reported $10 billion in profits and paid zero in taxes. My brothers are part of why is ready to root out corruption and fight back, and that gives us a base to work from. America is ready for 2 cent wealth tax. It’s supported by Republicans, Democrats and Independents, and it lets us invest in all of our children. E. America is ready to expand social security payments and disability payments by $200 a month and we can do it. You know, someone asks what this would mean, you just give somebody $200 a month. They asked me this in a town hall, and a lady who wanted it said, “you know what it will mean to me. It’ll mean I can get a prescription filled, and I can still buy toilet paper this same week.” That’s where Americans are right now. I am not working for millionaires and billionaires. I’m here to work for the tens of millions of people across this country who are ready to build an America that won’t just work those at the top, but that will work for everyone. Thank you. 45 years, Americans have been listening to great speeches, and at the end of the day, the average American worker is not making a nickel more than he or she did in real wages, over those 45 years. The truth is that real change always takes place. Real change always takes place from the bottom on up, never from the top on down. And that is why in this campaign, I am so proud that we have over a million volunteers. We have some of the strongest grassroots organizations. We have raised more individual contributions than any candidate in American history. Please join the political revolution @berniesanders.com. Let’s defeat Trump. Let’s transform this country. Thank you. And finally Vice President Biden. Thank you very much for listening, seven days out, Christmas. Thank you very much. Look, we all have big progressive plans and the question is, who can deliver on those plans? And it seems to me we have to ask ourselves three questions straight up and honestly. Who has the best chance, most likely chance of defeating Donald Trump? Who is the one who’s most likely to do that? Number two, who can help elect Democrats to the United States Senate, in States like North Carolina and Georgia and Arizona and other States. And thirdly, who can deliver legislatively? That requires you to look at our records. I have a significant record of getting significant things done from the Violence Against Women Act and the Chemical Weapons Treaty in foreign and domestic policy alike. And so I think asking those questions, I believe, as you expect, that I’m the most qualified to answer those three questions. But most of all, we’ve got to level with the American people. Don’t play games with them, tell them the truth and be authentic. God bless you all and may you all have a great, great holiday season and thank you guys for doing this as well. Thank you. Thank you very much. And that concludes the PBS news hour Politico debate. I do want to thank my colleagues here at the moderator table, Tim Alberta of Politico, Amna Nawaz and Yamiche Alcindor of the PBS news hour. Thank you all for joining us. Please stick around and watch PBS for some analysis. Thank you to the candidates."
"164","12-22-20"," Good afternoon, everyone. Before I take questions, I’d like to wish everyone a Merry Christmas and happy holidays. This has been one of the toughest years we’ve ever faced as a nation, and the pandemic, the economic crisis, calls for racial justice, historic and punishing wildfires and storms. So this season of reflection carries a much deeper meaning than it usually does. Over 320,000 lives lost to this virus. And Jill and I send our prayers as I’m sure all of you do to all who are facing this dark winter with an empty seat at the dinner table, where a loved one used to sit and talk and laugh and reminisce. Our hearts go out to all of you who have fallen on hard times, through no fault of your own, I might add. Unable to sleep at night, weighed down with the worry of what tomorrow will bring for you and for your family. We’re especially grateful for the healthcare workers on the front lines, the scientists, the researchers, the clinical trial participants on the front lines of the vaccine who deserve our thanks and who delivered a scientific breakthrough. And for all of you who have deployed family, deployed family members in the military. We know what it’s like. We know what that experience is like, how difficult it can be, especially at this time of the year. Our family knows your sacrifice and our hearts are always with you. But keep the faith. Throughout this year, we had to forgo many of our favorite holiday traditions we have as families, as communities, and as a country. For the Bidens, we usually have 20 to 25 family members over for Christmas dinner. And then the immediate family, 14 of our kids and grandkids and their spouses for coming down the stairs on Christmas morning. But not this year. Like we did over Thanksgiving, we all have to care enough for each other that we have to stay apart just a little bit longer. I know it’s hard. We have a long way to go, but we’re grateful that we’ve got the vaccine. And yesterday in an effort to instill some confidence in the vaccine, I had my shot administered in public. And I got a chance to thank all those nurses and docs at Christiana Hospital for what they’ve been putting up with and doing for so long. I look forward to the second shot and I have absolute confidence in the vaccine. But we’re in short supply. Taking the vaccine from a vial into the arm of millions of Americans is one of the biggest operational challenges the United States has ever faced. We’re 300 million people, and we’re going to take many more months for that to happen. In the meantime, this pandemic rages on. Experts say things are going to get worse before they get better, not withstanding the fact we have the vaccine. As you all know, we’re averaging a death rate of close to 3000 people a day. That means we’re going to lose tens of thousands of more lives in the months to come. And the vaccine won’t be able to stop that. So we’ll still have to remain vigilant. We need everyone to mask up, stay socially distanced, avoid large gatherings, particularly inside. We need to work in a bipartisan way. That’s the only way we’re going to get through this, in tough times. We have our first hint and glimpse of bipartisanship. I applaud the Congress their economic relief package that included funding for vaccine distribution, much needed temporary relief for workers, families, and small businesses. In this election, the American people made it clear they want us to reach across the aisle and work together on matters of national concern to get something done. And I believed that to be the case from the very beginning of my campaign. And I’m happy to see members of Congress heeding that message as well from their own constituents. Leaders in both House and Senate, both parties, deserve credit for making the hard compromises to get this done. But like all compromises it’s far from perfect, but it does provide vital relief at a critical moment. However, as I’ve said all along, this bill is just the first step, a down payment, in addressing the crisis, the crises, more than one, that we’re in. There are a lot more work to do. Early next year, I’m going to put forward to the Congress my plans for what comes next. We’ll need more help to fully distribute the vaccine. We’re going to need more testing in order to be able to open our schools. We need more funding to help firefighters and police, many of whom are being laid off as I speak. And the same with nurses, risking their lives in the front lines. The same for millions of hurting families who are unable to put food on the table, pay rent, or the mortgage. Unemployment’s extended for another 10 weeks. It’s going to take a lot longer than that. But Congress did its job this week, and I can and I must ask them to do it again next year. But even with the changes in approach I’m going to put in place in late January, people are still going to be getting sick and dying from COVID. One thing I promise you about my leadership during this crisis, I’m going to tell it to you straight. I’m going to tell you the truth. And here’s the simple truth. Our darkest days in the battle against COVID are ahead of us, not behind us. So we need to prepare ourselves, to steel our spines. As frustrating as it is to hear, it’s going to take patience, persistence, and determination to beat this virus. There will be no time to waste in taking the steps we need to turn this crisis around. My administration will start to do it’s part on our first day in office, with masking requirements, a new strategy for testing, accelerated protection, protective gear. And we’re going to challenge Congress and the American people to step up immediately as well to do their part. Passing the relief bill passed by Congress is another challenge which my administration will confront, on a bipartisan basis. A massive cyber security breach against the US companies, many of them, as well as federal agencies. And there’s still so much we don’t know, including the full scope of the breach or the extent of the damage it has caused. But we know this much, this attack constitutes a grave risk to our national security. It was carefully planned and carefully orchestrated. It was carried out by using sophisticated cyber tools. The attackers succeeded in catching the federal government off guard and unprepared. Foreign actors have been working on this breach since late last year, at least last year, setting the landscape to compromise our systems, scraping up sensitive information from our world-class tech sector and from private businesses and from United States government agencies. The truth is this, the Trump Administration failed to prioritize cyber security. It did that from eliminating or downgrading cyber coordinators in both the White House and at the State Department, to firing the Director of Cyberspace and Infrastructure Security Agency, to President Trump’s irrational downplaying of the seriousness of this attack. Enough’s enough. In an age when so much of our lives are conducted online, cyber attacks must be treated as a serious threat by our leadership at the highest levels. We can’t let this go unanswered. That means making clear and publicly who was responsible for the attack and taking meaningful steps to hold them in account. Russia. Russia is responsible for this breach. It certainly fits Russia’s long history of reckless, disruptive cyber activities, but the Trump administration needs to make an official attribution. This assault happened on Donald Trump’s watch, when he wasn’t watching. It’s still has responsibility as President to defend American interests for the next four weeks. But rest assured, that even if he does not take it seriously, I will. While I’m disappointed by the response of President Trump. I was pleased to see leaders in both parties in the Congress, speak out loudly and clearly on this attack. Again, I want to thank prominent Republicans in the Senate, particularly, for speaking out. It’s a sign, a sign that with a new administration, we can confront these threats on a bipartisan basis with a united front here at home. That should be encouraging to the American people and a warning to our adversaries. In the meantime, the President’s team for the next four weeks need to cooperate fully, which they haven’t been doing, to share information as it becomes available on both the impact and our response, to ensure a smooth transition to protect the American people as administrations change. Over the next month, I intend to continue focusing on building my team, so that the right people are in place on day one of my administration, to take over this effort, to prioritize cyber security across the board. I’ll consult with experts to plan for the steps that my administration will take in order to secure our systems, improve our cyber defenses and to better withstand future attacks that we know will come and to impose costs on those who conduct them. I fully expect bipartisan support from this, based on what we’ve heard so far. Our adversaries are highly capable. Cyber threats are among the greatest threats to our global security in the 21st century. I believe we have to treat them with the same seriousness of purpose that we treated threats of other unconventional weapons. We have to work with our allies to establish clear international rules and mechanisms to enforce them, and consequences for those countries that violate them. I want to close with this. As I look at the first of what will be millions of vaccinations going in the arms of Americans after 100s, 1000s of lives lost, Congress, finally passing an economic relief package after months and months of delay, at a new urgency for bipartisan approach to cybersecurity, after years of a President who refused to stand up to our adversaries and hold them accountable, I’m reminded of a quote, this season from a Jesuit Priest named Alfred Delp. He wrote, “Advent is a time for rousing.” Delp believed, at first, we are shaken to our depths, and then we’re ready for a season of hope. As a nation, we’ve certainly been shaken to our depths this year. Now it’s time to wake, to get moving, a time for hope. We’ve gotten through tough times before in this nation. We’ll get through these difficult times as well. We’ll do it by coming together, by working with one another, by being … You’ve heard me say many times what we are at our best, the United States of America. There are certain things that rise way above partisan differences, that threaten the United States. There are national security interests. I require us to cooperate and I’m confident, I’m confident we’ll be able to do that. After a year of pain and loss, it’s time to unite, to heal, to rebuild. For all those who are suffering right now, that enormous loss and lie awake at night wondering what tomorrows bring, I’d say, “Well, God bless you all, and I promise you, we’re going to continue to push as hard as we can to finish the job.” May God bless you all. May God protect our troops. Merry Christmas and happy holidays to you all. Now I’d be happy to take some questions. Thank you, Mr. President Elect. President Obama once referred to this emerging cyber battlefield as the wild west. President Trump in commenting on this most recent breach said the situation was well under control. The answer is, first of all, it is a grave risk and it continues. I see no evidence that it’s under control. I’ve seen none, heard of none. The Defense Department won’t even brief us on many things. I know of nothing that suggests it’s under control. This President has even identified who’s responsible yet. Number two, the question of the damage done, remains to be determined. We have to look at it very closely, the nature of the breaches, how extensive they are and what damage has been done. Thirdly, there’s going to be a necessity, as President Obama and I, and our administration talked about, we need international society, international rules of the road on cyber security. We have to bring along our allies and our friends, so we hold everyone accountable who breaches any of these basic fundamental rules. Lastly, I believe that when I learned the extent of the damage and in fact who is formally responsible, they can be assured that we will respond and probably respond in kind. There’s many options, which I will not discuss now. We have not done that in any other areas where we have faced international crises. We don’t sit here and say that we’re going to strike you with a nuclear weapon. We don’t sit, and we’re going to say, and so on. Let us determine what the extent of the damage is, and I promise you, they’re be a response. On another issue, Sir, as you know, the run-off elections in Georgia could well determine whether there’s a Democratic Senate in January or a Republican Senate in January. No, not based on the Attorney General. It’s just a matter of getting to it and through it and being able to announce them all. They’ll all be announced either just before or just after. We’re going to make an announcement tomorrow. We may have another announcement between then and Christmas, and New Year’s. We’re just working through all of the efforts to do due diligence. No. I guarantee you I’m going to do what I said. The Attorney General of the United States of America is not the President’s lawyer. I will appoint someone who I expect to enforce the law as the law is written, not guided by me. Thank you, sir. [inaudible 00:00:17:35]. Thank you, Mr. President Elect. There is growing concern today about that new variant of COVID-19 sweeping across the UK. As you know, there already is one, unrelated to finding that new strain, number one. It only allows Americans coming home to be able to come back to the states, citizens. One of the things I’m waiting to get a response from my COVID team is whether or not we should require testing before they get on an aircraft to fly home, number one. Number two, when they get home, should they quarantine? That’s my instinct, but I’m waiting to hear from my experts right now. You talked about how you want to propose a new COVID relief plan when you do take office. Yes. It took more than six months for Congress to reach this new deal. Americans are suffering at this moment. You all asked the most interesting questions. Have you ever known anyone in the history of the United States of America that could be president and assure exactly what the Congress is going to do? I can’t assure anything, but I can tell you what I expect. I fully expect on those critical issues that we’re facing, number one, being able to get all the work we need done and all the funding to be able to get that vaccine in everyone’s arm, and that’s 300 million people. We’ll get that done because you’re going to see that the responsibility has already been recognized by the Republicans and Democrats in the Congress, because the constituency is going to demand it. Number one. Number two, all those people are out there hurting, have lost jobs through no fault of their own, they’ve extended unemployment for 10 weeks. Simply not sufficient. Necessary to get it done to get through the holidays, but I predict you we’ll get cooperation and get that done. I’ve been arguing from the very beginning and told how … I love it. It makes me sound so much younger, how naive I am about how the Congress works. I think I’ve been proven right across the board. The things that are left to deal with from unemployment to people needing unemployment insurance to the ability to have access to healthcare, the ability to get this treatment for free, et cetera, all of that is something that the public is not going to stand for us not doing. And I think with Donald Trump not in the way, that will also enhance the prospect of things getting done. Well look, that’s a negotiated issue, but it will. Yes, it will. And I think, by the way, I think we owe Bernie Sanders and his Republican colleagues the thanks for getting not all the stimulus we looked for, 1200, but getting 600 done. I think you’re seeing that there is a clear understanding that these issues go beyond any ideology. People are desperately hurting and the Republicans are hurting as badly as Democrats. There are a few people, and I’m not saying they’re responsible for any of this, but a few people are doing extremely well in that K shaped recovery. And they’re doing fine. But they still need access to the vaccines. They still need access to making sure that we are able to handle crises in the hospitals, et cetera. So I think on the things relating to A, vaccine distribution, which is going to cost billions more dollars, is simply going to cost billions more dollars. We need national standards, the layout to help governors to start how they’re going to get that vaccine throughout their communities, number one. Number two, we’re going to need to take care of those people who through no fault of their own are unemployed. They’ve worked like hell, but they have no job because of the COVID crisis. And thirdly, we’re going to have to begin to rebuild the country. We can’t wait. We can’t wait to rebuild the economy. And we’re going to have to start doing that now on infrastructure programs and a whole range of other things. I think sort of the dawn is broken on the vast majority of people. There are still people who don’t want to help. There’s still people who are insisting my way or the highway. But the vast majority of the members of the Congress, I believe, will be able to work out those specific issues that are of national consequence. Thank you, Mr. President Elect. Thank you. Mr. President Elect, thank you. Thank you. My ask will be laid out there in detail, but it relates to four things. Number one, making sure we have all the money we need to get the vaccine to 300 million Americans at a minimum over the next year, the next calendar year. Number one. Number two, making sure that all those people who are unemployed through no fault of their own because of the COVID crisis, small businesses and big businesses, et cetera, shutting down, that they continue to be able to live day to day. They don’t engage in food shortages. They’re not in a position where they get thrown out of their homes. I would also be asking for a moratorium on being evicted from your homes for failure to pay rent, moratoriums on relating to the issue of whether or not your mortgage would be paid. Thirdly, I think it’s critically important. We provide all of the PPE as well as the direct payments to small bid businesses and others to be able to stay open, to be able to keep their people employed. That is something that’s going to increase as time moves. And lastly, we’re going to need to make sure that we’re in a position that we can provide for the opportunity or for people to begin to go back to work and get new jobs, developing infrastructure. Given the narrow majorities in the House and Senate, you’ve watched many administrations come and go. I don’t think it’s a honeymoon at all. I think it’s a nightmare that everybody’s going through and they all say it’s got to end. It’s not a honeymoon. They’re not doing me a favor. I’ll ask you a rhetorical question. I don’t expect you to answer. And that is, do you think that Republicans were losing their businesses? Do you think Republican constituents out there who can’t pay their mortgage, do you think they’re not letting their Republican representatives know they got a problem? Do you think the person who just lost a family member and is worried about losing another one who happens to be a Republican, a staunch Republican, isn’t telling his or her Republican Senator or state representative, “You’ve got to help. I think there’s just been a dawning here. And look, you have a different team in town. You have a different team in town. I’m not going to villainize the opposition, but I’m going to stand and say, “This is what we got to do.” Because they know it. They know it. It’s not like I’m saying what we want to do is we want to make sure that we are going to sign a new trade agreement with A, B or C. This is life and death. That’s why I believe we’ll get it done. Sir, can I ask a follow-up to the Attorney General decision? You and President Obama selected Eric Holder on December 1st. Every recent president has selected their Attorney General by this point. The answer is, first of all, we’ve gone faster than everybody in the total cabinet. Not President Obama and yourself, sir. The whole cabinet. I do. I didn’t want to raise them though. But look, we’re looking for a team who will instill the greatest confidence in the professionals at DOJ to know once again that there is no politics, there’s no politics. As you know, there’s been a great debate about in every single appointment, whether or not people there are enough African-Americans, enough Hispanics, enough Asian Pacific Americans, enough people who are new and young. So we’re just working through it. It’s not by design. There’s not an obvious choice in my mind. There’s not an obvious choice in my mind. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Hi, Mr. President-Elect. Hey. You just spoke about your confidence that it’ll be possible to get things done once President Trump has left office. Excuse me. Not just because he’s left office, because it’s all becoming obvious exactly what’s at stake. Right. But even so, are you concerned about the effects long term that his presidency, and now in the transition his refusal to concede, his challenges to the election, will have on American politics, will have on the Republican party, especially if he does take the step of filing for reelection next month to run in 2024? Are you concerned about him lingering around? I see you smiling, but I still have to ask it. I’m like a real lame duck. Just watch me. Just watch me. I’ve been saying this from the very beginning. Look, let’s just get the work, from this point on for the next several years, there is one objective. And it’s not my political future, it’s bettering the circumstances for the average American. That’s what it’s all about. And I want to communicate to the American people what I hope they already understand about me. It’s about them, it’s not about me. It’s not about me. Well, we’ll see. I don’t know. I mean, I’m not a fortune teller, but I can tell you that the calls I’ve gotten from sitting Republicans in powerful positions, they know me. They know I level with them. They know I never mislead. They know I tell them the truth. And they know I don’t go out of my way to try to embarrass. And in terms of the transition, are there areas where the Trump team has not been cooperative that have not been made public? We’ve heard a bit about the issues at the Pentagon last week. There are other areas. I’m not sure it’s relevant whether the public should be aware of. Look, what I’m trying to do is pull together the political parties that are in the Congress that know that we’re facing four serious crises. And we have to address all of them. None of us will get all we want, but we can make real progress. And so my focus is on uniting, not emphasizing the divisions. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President-elect. Russia, as you said, is suspected of carrying out this massive cyber hack. You said it happened under President Donald Trump’s watch, but of course in January ’21, it will then, of course, land on your doorstep. Let’s get something straight, will land on my doorstep. His failure will land on my doorstep. Yes. Okay. I can’t ensure it, but I can demand, based on the experts both here and among our allies, what is needed to find that out. It may cost literally billions of dollars to secure our cyberspace. It may take a great deal to get it done. First and foremost, it takes people who are knowledgeable and vigilant about what is happening and how it’s happening. And so I’m just going to do all that need be done. All that need be done to determine, A, the extent of the damage. B, the nature of how it occurred. C, what I should be doing internally in terms of my administration to protect against it in the future. And number four, getting together with our allies to try to set up an international system of what constitutes appropriate behavior in cyberspace and get us all to get to the point where we all hold any other country liable for their breaking out of those basic roles. Of course I can’t. I don’t know what the state of them is. They’re clearly not safe right now. And then between now and January 20th, the likelihood of my being able to garner all the information, the extent and depth of the violations, exactly how the codes or how were breached, what was breached, what was done, is not within my power to do that. But it will be an overwhelming focus for my administration. And my other question is on immigration. I was just reading about the fact that officials in your transition, Jake Sullivan, Susan Rice, they say you won’t be immediately rolling back Trump immigration policies. And I expressed immediately. I already started discussing these issues with the president of Mexico and our friends in Latin America. And the timeline is to do it so that we, in fact, make it better, not worse. The last thing we need is to say we’re going to stop immediately the access to asylum the way it’s being run and end up with two million people on our border. It’s a matter of setting up the guardrails so we can move the direction. I will accomplish what I said I would do, a much more humane policy based on family unification. But it requires getting a lot in place and requires getting the funding to get it in place, including just asylum judges, for example. So it’s a matter of it will get done and it will get done quickly. But it’s not going to be able to be done on day one, lift every restriction that exists and find out that and go back to what it was 20 years ago and all of a sudden find out we have a crisis on our hand that complicates what we’re trying to do. What would you say to immigration advocates then who say maybe you’re possibly dragging your feet and it might take too long? It sounds like you’re saying you need to be patient. I say trust me. Look at me. I’ve never told them anything I haven’t done. I’m working with them now. We’re dealing with some of those very organizations as we speak. And I will do what I said. It’s going to take not day one, it’s going to take probably the next six months to put that in place. Thank you so much. Thank you. Merry Christmas, everybody. Thank you. Mr. Yes, yes, yes. God love you, man. You’re a one horse pony. I tell you. Thank you. Thank you. I promise you, my Justice Department will be totally on its own in making its judgments about how they should proceed. Thank you."
"165","12-23-20"," I’m Joe Biden. I’m Dr. Joe Biden’s husband. Just like educators everywhere, being an educator is what she does. It’s who she is. Once again, during this pandemic we’ve seen who are educators are. They’re selfless, they’re dedicated, they’re cut from a true cloth of character and commitment. They represent one of the most critical professions in America, and that’s not hyperbole, that’s a fact. From the cradle to career, they give people of all ages, the confidence to be believe in themselves, to equip them to succeed. And as Jill says, any country that out educates us is going to out-compete us. And this critical moment of our nation’s history, it’s essential that there is an educator serving as secretary of education. I want to make that clear again, an educator, someone who’s taught in the classroom, who comes out of the classroom. Today, I’m pleased to announce that such a nominee we have, Dr. Miguel Cardona. Like other cabinet nominees and appointees, he’s brilliant, he’s qualified, and he’s tested. And he’s going to join the Biden-Harris cabinet, and it’s going to be a historic cabinet. Already there are more people of color in this cabinet than any cabinet in the history of the United States. There are more women than ever. First openly gay cabinet member. It’s a cabinet that looks like America. It taps into the best of America. That opens doors and includes the full range of talents we have in this nation. And like the rest of the team, Dr. Cardona is ready on day one. Vice president elect Harris and I we were going through, what who… You’re on this side, I apologize. We were going through this and we’re doing it on Zoom, who we were going to pick, and we’re getting all this advice, and we looked at each other and we said, “No, no, no. It’s Cardona.” It was really easy. So vice president elect knew we needed an education secretary who truly understands what it’s been like for educators, administrators, families, caregivers, and students this past year. They worry, they’re under stress, they stretched local budgets that have left educators out of work. There’s mixed signals from the White House that have left more confusion than calm. And they left so many parents and schools feeling like they’re on their own, but we also need someone who knows what it takes to get through this crisis. Reopening the schools safely will be a national priority for the Biden-Harris administration. Early next year, I will put forward, before the Congress, our plan as to what comes next. But I ensure you it includes funding to keep educators on the job, just like we did during the Recovery Act, and it saved 400,000 education jobs, and the future of millions of children. It also includes asking Congress to provide funding needed so we can achieve the ambitious, but doable goal, of safely opening majority of our schools by the end of our first 100 days. We can do this. If states and cities put strong public health measures in place that we can all follow. For example, in our first 100 days I’ll be asking all Americans to mask up for 100 days. We’ll require a mask in federal buildings, interstate travel, and the like and on trains where I have the authority to insist that happen. We’re also been talking to governors and mayors and county executives of both parties to try to do the same in their cities and their states. We can do it if we get the schools, districts, communities, and states, the clear guidance and the resources they need for so many things that aren’t in their already tight budgets. They need funding for testing, tell people reopen schools, more funding for transportation so students can maintain social distancing on school buses. There’s a need for school buildings for additional cleaning services, protective equipment, ventilation systems, but to lead the national effort requires an education sector, secretary, excuse me, with the skills to partner with educators across the country in states, localities, and tribal nations, and all across students and families as well. It also requires someone to understand that the need to prevent the pandemic from further exacerbating the inequities in our education system that represents a compounding problem we’re having. They hold back children, hold back educators, they hold back our country from filling its potential. Take remote learning. How could it be in America that parents must drive to a parking lot of a coffee shop or a library for wifi that they can’t afford at home, so their children can sit in the car, participate in class and do their homework over the net. This gap of broadband technology and the opportunity that some kids cost them a full year, a full year or more of learning. That’s unacceptable in the United States of America. We need to act now. And it’s only just the start. We needed some of the experience to help us build back better with the Biden-Harris education plan. We need to make sure that every child in this nation has access to a good education regardless of their zip code. I know you’re probably tired of me saying that, but it’s critically important. I’ve been saying it for over a year, regardless of any disability, that’s why my plan triples funding for title one schools, which serve the highest number of children from low income families. We need to make sure every child will have access to high quality universal pre-K. I’m not talking about daycare, I’m talking about universal pre-K that is starting at age three, four. We need to finally pay teachers what they deserve. The work they do is of extreme national importance and their salaries should reflect that. But they can’t do it alone. So we’re going to make an unprecedented investment to double the number of school psychologists, counselors, nurses, and social workers in our schools. When trained professionals are helping care for students’ mental health and behavioral needs, along with concerns around things like housing and food, it frees up educators to focus on teaching and the other critical work that teachers do in the classroom. We’ll make sure students with disabilities have the support to succeed by fully funding the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. We’re going to upgrade school infrastructures to make sure classrooms are safe. Build schools that are hubs of innovation and cutting edge learning. We know that in the 21st century, 12 years of schooling is not enough, and that young people are getting crushed by the burden of student debt. Under the legislation we’re going to be proposing, we’re going to have a number of policies to provide affordable higher education to alleviate that financial burden. This includes anyone being able to get into a community college, you’d be able to go there for free. Public colleges and universities will be tuition free for families earning less than $125,000. We’re going to cut student loan payments in half by using those income-based payments. If you’re making $25,000 or less per year, you won’t owe a dime of payment or interest while you’re only at that level. If you make more than that, you only pay a small percentage of your income in order to be able to pay off your debt. Our legislative plan also means that if you choose to go into public service, whether you’re a teacher, a paramedic, counseling victims of domestic violence, or whatever else, it’s only right that our country wipe out your student debt all together over time. It includes forgiving debt for undergraduate public tuition if you’re earning less than $125,000 a year. It means immediately forgiving $10,000 in student debt in the midst of this economic crisis. We’ll also invest more than $70 billion in historic black colleges and universities and minority serving institutions to help prepare these graduates, like our vice president elect, for good paying jobs in industries of the future. There’s so much we can do. So much that we can afford to do it. We can build an economy that eases the financial burden of the caregiving crisis. Make sure working families don’t pay more than 7% of their income on childcare for their young children. And like we did during the Obama-Biden administration, we can combat campus sexual assault under Title IX, something the Trump administration and the current secretary of education have only undermined. The bottom line is we can achieve all these critical things, but we need someone who gets that education isn’t just what we do as a nation. It’s who we are. It’s who we are. It’s a reason why we were one of the first nations in the world to have universal education. It was the reason why we got propelled in the twentieth century to begin to lead the world economically. And that person who understands this, I’m proud to announce, is former secretary of education. Now, well, I’m talking about his existing job, actually it’s not called education, but anyway, the secretary of education that we nominate is Dr. Miguel Cardona, fourth grade public school teacher, the youngest principal in the State of Connecticut. First official Latino to serve as the education commissioner, I started to call him the secretary of education, education commissioner. Dr. Cardona rose up the ranks to become I’m an assistant superintendent in the same school district he attended as an English learner student. The same district where he was born in public housing. The son and grandson of parents and grandparents who moved from Puerto Rico in search of new opportunities. He made it a point of taking new teachers on tours of his district’s neighborhoods. The wealthy blocks where students grew up with every resource they needed to get ahead. And the blocks where families are struggling to get by. Where a new calculator, or a nutritious breakfast weren’t a given. He understands that the deep roots of inequity that exists as a source of our persistent opportunities gaps. He understands the transformative power that comes from investing in public education. In our conversations, Dr. Cardona talked about how public education was the great equalizer. It gave him a chance to reach the dream his parents and grandparents had for him. A place where a high school teacher inspired him to be an educator. Public education, it helped Miguel become one of the first in his family to go to college. The first. The first to earn a doctorate, and with that preparation and grounding, Dr. Cardona has brought his heart, his knowledge, and his passion for education to bear on behalf of the students across Connecticut. And when that pandemic struck, he was ready, he helped secure more than 140,000 laptops. More than 40,000 internet connections for students who lacked them. Because of him, Connecticut became the first state in the nation to ensure that every single public school student was equipped to engage in remote learning, regardless of family income. As the months passed, he followed health guidance and he got the funding and the resource to provide masks and plexiglass and testing so schools could reopen and operate safely. That’s the vision. Resolve and initiative all going to help us contain this pandemic and reopen our schools safely and build back better. And it’s a standard of care that comes from having taught in a classroom. That comes from a hardworking family who found their way in America through public education. It comes from someone who knows from his core that our nation’s children are the kite strings that lift our national ambitions aloft. He is a secretary of education for this moment. I thank him and his family for accepting this call to serve. We can not do this without them, or him. To the career staff in the Department of Education, you’ll have a fantastic and trusted leader who will help you carry out the department’s mission with honor and integrity. The honor and integrity of an educator. And to the American people, to educators, families, caregivers, and students, help is on the way. I wish all of you, a Merry Christmas and a happy holiday. May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. I’m going to turn you over to the next secretary of education, Dr. Miguel Cardona. Mr. President Elect, Madam Vice President Elect, thank you for this opportunity to serve. I know how challenging this year has been for students, for educators, and for parents. I’ve lived those challenges alongside millions of American families. Not only in my role as state education commissioner, but as a public school parent, and as a former public school classroom teacher. For so many of our schools and far too many of our students, this unprecedented year has piled on crisis after crisis. It’s taken some of our most painful, long standing disparities and wrenched them open even wider. It’s taxed our teachers, our leaders, our school professionals and staff who already pour so much of themselves into their work. It’s taxed families struggling to adapt to new routines as they balance the stress, pain, and loss that this year has given. It has taxed young adults trying to chase their dreams to advance their education beyond high school, and carve out their place in the economy of tomorrow. And it is stolen time from our children who’ve lost something sacred and irreplaceable this year despite the heroic efforts so many of our nations educators. Though we are beginning to see some light at the end of the tunnel. We also know that this crisis is ongoing, that we will carry its impacts for years to come. And that the problems and inequities that have plagued our educational system since long before COVID will still be with us even after the virus has gone. So it’s our responsibility, it’s our privilege to take this moment and to do the most American thing imaginable, to forge opportunity out of crisis, to draw on our resolve, our ingenuity, and our tireless optimism as a people and build something better than we’ve ever had before. That’s a choice Americans make every day. It’s a choice that defines us as Americans. It’s the choice my grandparents made. [Javelino 00:16:08] and Maria [de la Pass 00:00:16:08] Cardona and [Hermana Mones Rosa 00:16:12], when they made their way from Aguada, Puerto Rico for new opportunities in Connecticut. I’m proud to say I was born at the Yale Lakers housing projects. That’s where my parents, Hector and Sarah Cardona instilled early on the importance of hard work, service to community, and education. I was blessed to attend the public schools in my hometown of Meriden, Connecticut, where I was able to expand my horizons and become the first in my family to graduate college and become a teacher, a principal, and assistant superintendent in the same community that gave me so much. That is the power of America. And I, being bilingual and bicultural am as American as apple pie and rice and beans. For me, education was the great equalizer, but for too many students, your zip code and your skin color remained the best predictor of the opportunities you’ll have in your lifetime. We’ve allowed what the educational scholar, Pedro Noguera calls the normalization of failure to hold back too many of America’s children. For far too long we’ve allowed students to graduate from high school without any idea of how to meaningfully engage in the workforce, while good paying high, skilled, technical, and trade jobs go unfilled. For far too long we’ve spent money on interventions and band-aids to address disparities instead of laying a wide strong foundation of quality, universal, early childhood education and quality, social, and emotional supports for all of our learners. For far too long we’ve let college become inaccessible to too many Americans for reasons that have nothing to do with their aptitude or aspirations, and everything to do with cost burdens. And unfortunately, an internalized culture of low expectations for some. For far too long we’ve worked in silos, failing to share our breakthroughs and our successes in education. We need schools to be places of innovation, knowing that this country was built on innovation. And for far too long, the teaching profession has been kicked around and not given the respect it deserves. It shouldn’t take a pandemic for us to realize how important teachers are for this country. There are no shortages of challenges ahead. No shortage of problems for us to solve, but by the same token, there are countless opportunities for us to seize. We must embrace the opportunity to reimagine education and build it back better. We must evolve it to meet the needs of our students. There’s a saying in Spanish that we say, we say, [foreign language 00:19:15]. We gain strength from joining together. In that spirit, I look forward to sitting at the table with educators, parents, caregivers, students, advocates, state, local, and tribal leaders. There’s no higher duty for a nation then to build better paths, better futures for the next generation to explore. For too many students, public education in America has been a [foreign language 00:19:49]. A wilted rose. Neglected, in need of care. We must be the master gardeners who cultivate it, who work every day to preserve its beauty and its purpose. I’m grateful for the chance to take on this responsibility. And I’m grateful to my own children, Miguel Jr., Or as we call him Angelito. To my daughter, Celine, and to my wife and best friend, Marissa, herself, a middle school family school liaison. And I’m grateful for the trust you’ve placed in me, Mr. President Elect and Madam Vice President Elect. I look forward to getting to work on behalf of America’s children and the families and the communities and the nation they will grow up to inherit and lead. Thank you. My first grade teacher, Mrs. Francis Wilson, God rest her soul, attended my law school graduation. She taught our first grade class with two teacher’s aides and 22 students in the classroom. And she instilled in me a deep belief in the importance and significance of public education that I carry with me to this day. If we are going to fulfill our country’s promise, we must be dedicated to a strong public education system. We must value it, we must strengthen it, and we must invest in it. Because one of the most important gifts a society can give its young people is the gift of a world-class education. We also know that right now, our education system, as we have discussed, from early learning centers to colleges and universities is reeling from this pandemic. Parents and educators are being stretched to their limits. And so are the cafeteria workers, and the bus drivers, and custodians, and nurses who normally keep our schools running. Students at colleges and technical colleges now worry about losing credits, losing financial aid, and losing income from working on campus. And all of this disruption is taking a heavy toll on the mental health and wellbeing of our students of all ages who are at risk of falling behind. At the same time, this pandemic threatens to widen disparities between students of different races and backgrounds, making it harder for those who already were behind to keep up. So first things first, we need to get this virus under control and reopen our schools safely as the president elect always says. And that is why the president elect and I are supporting funding for our education system in this recently passed COVID-19 relief legislation, and we will continue to fight for additional emergency relief for our educators and our schools. And even as we do, we must also build a public education system that lifts up all Americans, regardless of race, background, or zip code. An education system that prepares them with the knowledge and the skills to thrive in a 21st century economy. We must make sure our children are getting the foundation that’s so important for lifelong success. We must end the current status quo where school districts with the greatest needs get the fewest resources. And we must remove barriers to opportunity for poor and rural communities and communities of color. The leader that we have announced today will help us do that and unlock the power of an education for all Americans. Dr. Miguel Cardona is not only a seasoned public servant, he is also a former public school teacher and administrator with the experience in the classroom. And he knows what our students, teachers, and schools need to be successful. He has dedicated his career to fighting for our children, and dedicated his career to investing in their capacity. And he has a deep belief in the power of a world-class education to help every child everywhere overcome barriers of race, gender, or income to reach their God-given potential. Dr. Cardona represents the very best of our nation and he is the kind of leader America’s students, educators, and families deserve. I’ve always believed that government has three principle functions, public health, public safety, and public education. Over the course of the past few weeks, we have announced remarkable leaders who will help contain this pandemic and keep the American people safe, and secure. Under Dr. Cardona’s leadership, we will work together to put together an outstanding education system that will be within reach for everyone, breaking down barriers to equality, opening new paths to opportunity, and helping to fulfill America’s promise to all of our children. Thank you, Mr. President Elect. Thank you. Mr. Mr. President [inaudible 00:26:16] COVID relief. How will you make good on your promise no one in your family will have foreign businesses. Hunter has [inaudible 00:26:23]. Chinese holdings. [inaudible 00:26:24]."
"166","12-28-20"," Federal, state and local law enforcement are working around the clock to gain more information on motive and intent. This bombing was a reminder of the destructive power that an individual or a small group can muster and the need for continuing vigilance across the board. I want to thank the police department in Nashville, particularly those five police officers who worked so quickly to evacuate the area before the explosion occurred, risking their own lives. And for all the firefighters and first responders who jumped into action early on that Christmas morning, last Christmas morning. Their bravery and cool headedness likely saved lives and prevented a worse outcome, and we are internally grateful to that law enforcement agency. And I know the hearts of all Americans are with the people of Nashville as they rebuild and recover from this traumatic event. Now Vice President Harris and I, along with our nominees that lead the national security institutions have just been briefed by some of the professionals who have been conducting agency reviews as a part of our transition. This a long standing part of the orderly transition of power in American democracy. We welcome teams from the incoming Trump Pence Administration four years ago, gave them access to all that we had. And over the past few weeks, teams of genuine policy and management experts, many of them previous government experience who have gone into agencies across the government to conduct interviews with personnel, to gather information and to assess the state of the federal government, excuse me, that we will shortly inherit. These teams worked under incredibly difficult circumstances, taking COVID-19 precautions and waiting weeks for the ascertainment, meaning that so they could go in and be cleared to go in, but they have done an outstanding job. For some agencies, our teams received exemplary cooperation from the career staff in those agencies. From others, most notably the Department of Defense, we encountered obstruction from the political leadership of that department. And the truth is, many of the agencies that are critical to our security have incurred enormous damage. Many of them have been hollowed out in personnel, capacity and in morale. In the policy processes that have atrophied or have been sidelined, in the despair of our alliances and the disrepair of those alliances, and our absence from key institutions that matter to the welfare of the American people. And the general disengagement from the world and all of it makes it harder for our government to protect the American people, to defend our vital interests in a world where threats are constantly evolving and our adversaries are constantly adapting. Rebuilding the full set of our instruments of foreign policy and national security is a key challenge that the Vice President elect Harris and I will face upon taking office, starting with our diplomacy. Today, we heard from the leaders of the state and USA ID agency review teams about the critical early investment we’re going to need to make in our diplomacy and our development efforts and in rebuilding our alliances to close the ranks with our partners and bring to bear the full benefits of our shared strength for the American people. When we consider the most daunting threats of our time, we know that meeting them requires American engagement and American leadership, but also that none of them can be solved by America acting alone. Take climate change, for example. The United States accounts for less than 15% of the global carbon emissions, but without clear, coordinated and committed approach from the other 85% of the carbon emitters, the world will continue to warm. Storms will continue to worsen. Climate change will continue to threaten the lives and livelihoods, and public health and economics of our existence and our, literally, the very existence of our planet. We’ve learned so painfully this year the cost of being unprepared for a pandemic that leaps borders and circles the globe. If we aren’t investing with our partners around the world to strengthen the health systems everywhere, we’re undermining our ability to permanently defeat COVID-19 and we’re leaving ourselves vulnerable to the next deadly epidemic. And as we compete with China to hold China’s government accountable for its trade abuses, technology, human rights, and other fronts, our position would much stronger when we build coalitions of like-minded partners and allies that make common cause with us in defense of our shared interest and our shared values. We make up only 25%, almost 25%, of the entire economy of the world, but together with our democratic partners, we more than double our economic leverage. On any issue that matters to the US and China relationship from pursuing a foreign policy for the middle class including a trade and economic agenda that produces and protects American workers, our intellectual prosperity and the environment to ensure security and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region. To championing human rights, we’re stronger and more effective when we’re flanked by nations that share our vision and the future of our world. That’s how we multiply the impact of our efforts to make those efforts more sustainable. That’s the power of smart, effective American leadership. But right now there’s an enormous vacuum. We’re going to have to regain the trust and confidence of a world that has begun to find ways to work around us or work without us. We also heard from key leaders of our intelligence and defense review teams, including Stephanie O’Sullivan, former Principal Deputy Director of the National Intelligence and retired Army Lieutenant General, Karen Gibson. We talked about the different strategic challenges we’re going to face from both Russia and China and the reforms we must make to put ourselves in the strongest possible position to meet those challenges. That includes modernizing our defense priorities to better deter aggression in the future, rather than continuing to overinvest in legacy systems designed to address threats of the past. We have to be able to innovate, to reimagine our defenses against growing threats in new realms like cyberspace. We’re still learning about the extent of the SolarWinds Hack and the vulnerabilities that have been exposed. As I said last week, this attack constitutes a grave risk to our national security. We need to close the gap between where our capabilities are now and where they need to be to better deter, detect, disrupt, and respond to those sorts of intrusions in the future. This is an area Republicans and Democrats are in agreement, and we should be able to work on a bipartisan basis to better secure the American people against malign cyber actors. And right now, as our nation is in a period of transition, we need to make sure that nothing is lost in the handoff between administrations. My team needs a clear picture of our force posture around the world and our operations to deter our enemies. We need full visibility into the budget planning underway at the Defense Department and other agencies in order to avoid any window of confusion or catch up that our adversaries may try to exploit. But as I said from the beginning, we have encountered roadblocks from the political leadership at the Department of Defense and the Office of Management and Budget. Right now, we just aren’t getting all the information that we need from the outgoing administration in key national security areas. It’s nothing short, in my view, of irresponsibility. Finally, we spoke about the day one challenge that we’re going to need to address immediately, drawing on the skillset of the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. We were briefed on the steps needed to clean up the humanitarian disaster that the Trump Administration has systematically created on our southern border. We will institute humane and orderly responses. That means rebuilding the capacity we need to safely and quickly process asylum seekers without creating near term crisis in the midst of this deadly pandemic. These are hard issues and the current administration has made them much harder by working to erode our capacity. It’s going to take time to rebuild that capacity. We’re going to work purposely, diligently and responsibly to roll back Trump’s restrictions starting on day one, but it is not as simple as throwing a switch to turn everything back on, especially amid a pandemic. We’ll have to have a process to ensure everyone’s health and safety, including the safety of asylum seekers hoping for a new start in the United States, free of violence and persecution. Of course, an essential part of this will be managing the safe, equitable, and efficient distribution of vaccinations to as many Americans as possible as quickly as possible. FEMA has an enormous part to play in this. And we heard from the former FEMA director, Craig Fugate, today. Want to make sure that our administration is poised to make full use of FEMA’s domestic reach and capacity in managing our COVID response. And finally, from every briefer, I was heartened, I was literally heartened to hear about the incredible strength we’ll be inheriting in the career professionals and working people across these agencies. They never stopped doing their jobs and continue to serve our country day in and day out to keep their fellow Americans safe just as they’ve always done. These agencies are filled with patriots who’ve earned our respect, and who should never be treated as political footballs. I’m looking forward to the honor of working with them again, to asking further advice and inputs, to help shape the best possible policies for all Americans. I want to thank the incredible folks who’ve served on these agency review teams as part of this transition. They’ve dedicated their time and energy, their vital experience and expertise to help ensure Vice President Harris and I are ready to hit the ground running. And we look forward the start of a new year, fresh with hope and possibilities for better days to come, but clear-eyed about the challenges that will not disappear overnight. I want to reiterate my message to the American people. We’ve overcome incredible challenge as a nation, and we’ve done it before and we will do it again. We’ll do it by coming together, by uniting after years of pain and loss, a year particularly needed to heal, to rebuild, to reclaim America’s place in the world. This is the work that lies ahead of us and I know we’re up to the task. We will champion liberty and democracy once more. We will reclaim our credibility to lead the free world. And we will once again lead, not just by the example of our power, but by the power of our example. God bless you all and may God protect our troops. Thank you. Yes."
"167","12-29-20"," Our economy is poised to come back and come alive and I can see a return to normalcy in the next year. I also see incredible opportunities for our nation in the years ahead in job creation, clean energy, racial equality, and much more. But we need to be honest. The next few weeks and months are going to be very tough, a very tough period for our nation, maybe the toughest during this entire pandemic. I know it’s hard to hear but it’s the truth. As Roosevelt said, “I think the American people can take whatever we tell them if we tell them straight from the shoulder.” We need to steel our spines for what’s ahead. We need to follow even more closely the recommendations to slow the spread of the virus. And each of us needs to do what we can to protect ourselves, our families and our fellow Americans. We’re going to get through this. Brighter days are coming but it’s going to take all the grit and determination we have as Americans to get it done. So today I want to be clear about five things every American should know about our efforts to contain COVID-19 and where the vaccine stands today. First, things are going to get worse before they get better. In September, we passed a grim milestone, 200,000 deaths. At that time, in this very room many of you remember I warned that we hit 400,000 deaths before the end of the Trump administration in January. Critics said I was being too alarmist and negative but as I’ve said all along I will tell you like it is when it comes to COVID and the reality is it looks like that we’re going to hit that grim milestone. We’ve just crossed 330,000 deaths in America. We’re averaging daily death rates of nearly 2,200 people which means we’ll lose tens of thousands of more lives in the months to come. Hospitals are being stretched beyond capacity and that’s data before we see the impact of the cases coming from the recent holidays and this upcoming holiday of New Year’s Eve. People getting infected today don’t show up in cases for weeks and those who perish with the disease die weeks after initial exposure. So we have to anticipate that the infections over the holidays will produce soaring cases counts in January and soaring death tolls into February. Turning this around is going to take time. We might not see improvement until we’re well into March as we’ll take time for our COVID response plan to begin to produce visible progress. The second thing to know is the Trump administration’s plan to distribute vaccines is falling behind, far behind. Were grateful to the companies, the doctors, the scientists, the researchers, the clinical trial participants and Operation Warp Speed for developing the vaccines quickly. But as I long feared and warned the effort to distribute and administer the vaccine is not progressing as it should. A few weeks ago, the Trump administration suggested the 20 million Americans could be vaccinated by the end of December. With only a few days left in December we’ve only vaccinated a few million so far. And the pace of the vaccination program as moving now, if it continues to move as it is now, it’s going to take years, not months to vaccinate the American people. Which brings me to the third thing every American should know, the Biden Harris administration will spare no effort to make sure people get vaccinated. I’ve laid out three challenges in our first 100 days. One of them is ensuring that 100 million shots have been administered by the end of the first 100 days. If Congress provides the funding we’d be able to meet this incredible goal. It would take ramping up five to six times the current pace to one million shots a day. But even with that improvement, even if we boost the speed of vaccinations to one million shots a day, it will still take months to have the majority of the United States population vaccinated. I’ve directed my team to prepare a much more aggressive effort with more federal involvement and leadership to get things back on track. We’ll find ways to boost the pace of the vaccinations but as Dr. Fauci and others have stated these past few days this will take more time than anyone would like and more time than the promises from the Trump administration have suggested. This is going to be the greatest operational challenge we’ve ever faced as a nation but we’re going to get it done but it’s going to take a vast new effort that’s not yet underway. And that gets me to the fourth thing that we should know, I’m going to move heaven and earth to get us going in the right direction. I’m going to use my power under the Defense Production Act when I’m sworn in and order private industry to accelerate the making of the materials needed for the vaccines as well as protective gear. Vice-president Harris and I had been speaking with county officials, mayors, governors of both parties to speed up the distribution of the vaccines across the nation. We’re planning a whole government effort and we’re going to work to set up vaccination sites and send mobile units to hard to reach communities. And we also know there’s a vaccination hesitancy in many communities, especially black, Latino, Native American communities, who have not always been treated with the dignity and honesty they deserve by the federal government and the scientific community throughout our history. That’s why we will launch a massive public education campaign to increase vaccine acceptance. We’ll do everything we can to show the vaccines are safe and critically important for one’s own health and that of their families and the communities. That means we’re also going to make sure vaccines are distributed equitably so every person who wants a vaccine can get it no matter the color of their skin or where they live. And we’re going to ensure vaccinations are free of charge. Fifth, while the pandemic rages on and as we increase the supply, distribution and administration of the vaccine we have to remain vigilant. As part of the 100 day challenge I’m going to be asking the American people to wear a mask for the first 100 days of my administration. It’s not a political statement, it’s a patriotic duty. Our administration are going to require a mask wearing where I have the power to do so for federal workers, in federal facilities and interstate travel like planes and trains. And we’ve been working directly with county officials, mayors, governors, to implement mask mandates in their cities and their towns and their states. Masking has been a divisive issue in this country but COVID is a killer in red states and blue states alike. So I encourage you all to wear a mask, encourage your family and friends to do the same. It’s one of the easiest things we can do that will make a huge difference to save lives. Another 100 day challenge is opening most of our K through eight schools by the end of the first 100 days in the spring. Look, we can only do that if Congress provides the necessary funding so we get schools, districts, communities, and states the resources they need for those so many things that aren’t there already in a tight budget. They need funding for testing to help reopen schools, more funding for transportation so students can maintain social distances on buses. They need it for school buildings, for additional cleaning service, protective equipment, ventilation systems. This is going to require an additional tens of billions of dollars to get this done. And Congress also needs to fund and provide more protective equipment for frontline health workers who are still reusing masks and gowns. We need to scale up testing so anyone who needs one can get a test. After 10 months of the pandemic we still don’t have enough testing, it’s a travesty. All this vaccination, testing, protective gear is going to require more funding from Congress, more than was just approved. That’s why I’ll propose a COVID action package early next year and challenge Congress to act on it quickly. Look, my ability to change the direction of this pandemic starts in three weeks. With thousands dying every day between now and then let me conclude by discussing what needs to happen now. I congratulate the bipartisan majority on passing and the president on signing the COVID relief bill. It’s still, even though it’s a step, an important step, still a move in the right direction and it will help people in need. And it’ll pay for some but not all of what we need to fix the COVID response. It’s a down payment but now with that done I hope the president will also clearly unambiguously promote masks wearing. I give former governor Chris Christie credit. He and I have disagreed in a number of things but I’m thankful he’s now encouraging people to do the right thing and wear a mask for themselves, their loved ones and their country. I hope that President Trump will listen to him. He can do it too. It would make a huge difference for President Trump to say wear masks. I hope the president will clearly and unambiguously urge all Americans to take the vaccine once it’s available. I took it to instill public confidence in the vaccine. President elect Harris took hers today for the same reason. And when the president’s doctor’s recommend it President Trump should take it and it’s still the same degree of confidence. Let me also say this to the American people, we can save all the experts tell us between 60 and 100,000 lives in the weeks and months ahead if we just step up together, wear a mask, socially distance, wash our hands, avoid large indoor gatherings. I know all of these are not easy to ask but I’m asking you to make a sacrifice. You’re already making tremendous sacrifices every single day. It’s hard on your lives, on your livelihoods, on your kids, on your families. It’s not small what we’re asking of you but we’re in this together and the actions we take now are going to help us contain the pandemic and get us back to our lives and to our loved ones. So the American people to all of you I know there’s a lot we have to do but I want you to know there’s also much we can do. We’re the United States of America. We’ve been through hard times before as a nation and we’ll come through this as well. I promise you we will. So please, I wish you a happy new year. May God bless you and may God protect our troops. Wear a mask."
