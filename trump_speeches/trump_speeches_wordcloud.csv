"1","01-04-21","Well, I want to thank you very much. Hello, Georgia, by the way. There’s no way we lost Georgia. There’s no way. That was a rigged election, but we’re still fighting it and you’ll see what’s going to happen. We’ll talk about it. I just want to thank you. This is some crowd. Biden was here today, also. They had 14 people in three cars. No, there was no way. I just want to thank you. I’ve had two elections. I won both of them. It’s amazing. I actually did much better on the second one. It’s great to be back in this incredible state, the home of hardworking patriots who believe in God, family and country. Tomorrow, each of you is going to vote in one of the most important runoff elections of the history of our country. Frankly, forget about runoff. One of the most important elections, really. It’s really not runoff. It’s elections because it’s a biggie. Our country’s depending on you. The whole world is watching the people of Georgia tomorrow. You’ve got to swamp them because everything’s so crooked around. I mean, and not here. They were saying, “Oh, he’s complaining about Georgia.” No, no. I’m complaining about eight different states, and I think we’re going to win them all. You’re going to get everyone you know. You’re going to show up at the polls in record numbers. You got to swamp them and together we’re going to defeat the Democratic streamers and deliver a thundering victory to David Perdue. Where’s David? David, David. We love our David. I know David so well. He’s respected and loved by everyone. And someone that has really been a star in Washington, Kelly Loeffler. Where is Kelly? Where is our Kelly? What a job you’ve done. Thank you. I will tell you about Kelly. Kelly fights for me. David fights for me, that I can tell you. I will also say the Republicans, you have to understand, for the people that don’t fight, not for me, fighting for us because we have a lot of corrupt things that happen when they don’t fight. One thing I’ve learned about Republicans, they have some difficulties, but you know a difficulty that they don’t have? They never forget. They never forget. People are going to find that out because we have to go and we have to go all the way and that’s what’s happening. You watch what happens over the next couple of weeks. You watch what’s going to come out. Watch what’s going to be revealed. You watch. I have to tell you that the stakes of this election could not be higher. You vote tomorrow. You want to go out tomorrow. People want to go out. They don’t want to do the ballot thing. Don’t want to do it unless it’s the other side, in which case they just print them out. They don’t want to do it. They want to go and vote and make sure your vote is counted. Make sure they don’t let you say, “I’m sorry. Somebody else has already voted for you.” Your vote tomorrow will decide which party controls the United States Senate. The radical Democrats are trying to capture Georgia’s Senate seats so they can wield unchecked, unrestrained, absolute power over every aspect of your lives. If the liberal Democrats take the Senate and the White House… And they’re not taking this White House. We’re going to fight like hell, I’ll tell you right now. I was telling Kelly before, you can lose and that’s acceptable. You lose, you lose. You go, and you go wherever you’re going and you go and say, “Maybe I’ll do it again sometime, or maybe I won’t or I’ll get back to life.” But when you win in a landslide and they steal it and it’s rigged, it’s not acceptable. Not acceptable. Then you have a country that would be run, if these two don’t win, and if we don’t take the presidency, you have a country that would be run by Schumer, Pelosi, and Biden. The people of Georgia will be at the mercy of the left wing, socialist, communist, Marxists. That’s where it’s going. We don’t like to use the word communist. How about the press? Look at them back there. Look at all of them. How about the press? That’s a lot of press. Oh, boy. That’s a lot of press. But they’ve gone silent now. They have a new thing. They used to fight me left, right. I’d go, they’d go. You’d fight. I’d win. They’d win. Who knows who wins? But people would hear. Now they don’t want to talk about it. Unless they can say something bad about you, they don’t want to talk about it. So if we talk about certain subjects, as you’ve been watching over the last six months, all of a sudden they were getting clobbered so they went stone cold silent. Big tech, the fake news media, they go silent anymore. They don’t talk about it, and that is the beginning of communism. That’s exactly what happens. Because I think they hate our country and they despise Georgia values. I think a lot of you despise them as you know there’s nothing the radical Democrats will not do to get power that they so desperately crave. Even the outright stealing of elections, like they’re trying to do with us. We’re not going to let it happen over the pass, and I hope Mike Pence comes through for us, I have to tell you. I hope that our great vice president comes through for us. He’s a great guy. Of course, if he doesn’t come through, I won’t like him quite as much. No, Mike is a great guy. He’s a wonderful man and a smart man and a man that I like a lot, but he’s going to have a lot to say about it. One thing with him, you’re going to get straight shots. He’s going to call it straight. Over the past few weeks, we’ve demonstrated that we won the election in a landslide. Almost 75 million people voted for me, the most of any incumbent president in the history of our country. We won over 11 million, close to 12 million, more votes than 2016. One of the largest, actually, the single largest increase in the history of our country. No person that won went to a second term or went through an election where he got nearly 12 million votes. Nope. It never happened before. Never happened before. We made historic gains among African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, and we won the largest share of non-white vote of any Republican president in 60 years. We also won 18 out of 19 bellwether counties. Now, when you win just a few bellwether counties, you always win the election. We won 18 out of 19. That’s a record, and they said we didn’t win. We won 25 of 26 toss-up House races. I think we have one that we’re waiting for, right? Did you see the one in… Hello, Mike. How are you, Mike? Did you see the one in New York where Claudia, good woman… They keep finding votes. They keep finding votes. “She’s up by 18. Oh, we just found 19 votes.” That’s the same kind of stuff. Democrats were projected to gain 15 House seats and instead… And Kevin McCarthy gives us the credit. Good man. Very good man. My coattails, we swept our Republican House candidates to victory and we have a couple of great ones with us tonight, and the Democrats lost 14 seats. It was supposed to be the other way around. When that happens, no president loses unless they play games. You don’t lose. They play games. The fact is we won the presidential election. We won it big and we’re going to win tomorrow. We’re going to win it really big. We have to. We have to. People have no idea how important that is. Tonight, our mission here in Georgia is to make sure the radical left cannot rob you of your voice and your votes in Washington. You can’t lose these two people. I really know them well. They’re the most respected people. They’re great people and they really do have a voice and they love their state and they love their country. The Democrats are trying to steal the White House. You can not let them. You just can’t let them steal the U.S. Senate. You can’t let it happen. You can’t let it happen. David and Kelly are running against the most extreme liberal candidates in the history of your state, probably in the history of our country, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock. Well, I beat Ossoff once running against a very fine woman, Karen, who you know, and he was at 57 and I got involved and we drove him down to 49 and then he ended up in a runoff and she ended up winning. Now I have to beat him a second time. This is going to be, hopefully, easy because when you know what he stands for, when you know what Warnock stands for, it really should be easy. Cast deciding votes to rubber stamp the agenda of AOC and Bernie Sanders. Crazy Bernie. Stacey Abrams. What’s with this Stacey Abrams? Your governor and your secretary of state, they’re petrified of Stacey Abrams. What’s that all about? Did you see this consent decree they signed with signature verification? You can forget about it. What they have done to your state. I think most people have no idea what they’ve done to your state. That consent decree or these two people. I don’t know. They say they’re Republicans. I really don’t think they are. They can’t be. If we want to have a special session, because your legislature’s excellent, they want to have a… Why wouldn’t they let us have a special session? If they want to check signatures in Fulton County, not in Cobb County. We didn’t ask for Cobb County. They said, “We’ll do Cobb first and then we’ll do Fulton.” They do Cobb. Then they never get to Fulton. Why wouldn’t they do that? Why wouldn’t they do that? That’s a positive thing. Anyway, the Democrats want to turn America. I’ll be here in about a year and a half campaigning against your governor, I guarantee you that. I shouldn’t say this. I shouldn’t say this because I just don’t want you to tell anybody outside of this room, other than the millions of people now, but I endorsed him. He was in last place and I endorsed him. He went to first place immediately, and then he won the primary, and then I gave him a couple of rallies, which I don’t like doing for other people. I was telling Kelly, ” do rallies for other people. I do them for me, right?” Not that easy, a crowd like this. They say over 25,000 people. Over what? Over a couple of days notice. Is everybody glad you’re here, right? I think so. There is no place like a Trump rally, but you know what? This is a Kelly rally and a David rally. I wouldn’t do it unless I loved them both. I wouldn’t do it. But I’m going to be here in a year and a half and I’m going to be campaigning against your governor and your crazy secretary of state, that I can tell you. You have great candidates. They want to turn, the Democrats do, America into Venezuela with no jobs, no prosperity, no rights, no freedom, no future for you and your family. Here is exactly what the radical left will do if they win this runoff election, which we can’t let them do tomorrow. Tomorrow’s a big day. I guess we have to get over a million votes tomorrow, right, Kelly? Over a million. All right. That’s a lot of votes, Kelly, but we’ll do it. The one thing I know, if they win I’ll get no credit, and if they lose they’re going to blame Trump, these people. Kelly won’t let that happen. Please win tomorrow. You’re going to win so big, it’s going to be great story. It’s a great story, a very important story for our country, long beyond Georgia for our country. It’s such a big story. They’ll massively raise your taxes on the middle class to pay for socialism. The U.S. military, which we rebuilt. We’ve totally rebuilt the U.S. military, much of it coming right out of Georgia. We built it right out of Georgia, a lot of it. You have incredible contractors in Georgia, military contractors, and they got plenty of our money. Spent $2.5 trillion. When I took over the military, it was absolutely a mess. It was depleted. Now it’s the opposite of depleted. The U.S. military will be gutted and military families across the street and all over the state will be betrayed. Their benefits and opportunities will be slashed. Fort Benning, Fort Gordon and other Georgia military institutions will be the first on the chopping block. By the way, there’ll be forced to change the names of the bases where generations of American patriots trained to win two World Wars. I don’t know. Fort Benning. Let’s see. Give me a couple of names. I could give you some. I don’t want to give them the credit, but you’ll name them. You’ll name them after other people. Fort Trump. Yeah. How about that? I like that. Yeah, let’s change the name. Let’s change it. Kelly, let’s change it. If they name it Trump, let’s change it. No. Now they’re going to go back and say, “He wants to have Fort Benning changed to Trump.” Watch, they’ll say, “He’s asking, he’s begging for Fort Benning to be changed to Trump.” No, no. I don’t want that. The Democrats will surrender the entire U.S. manufacturing industry to China. You notice they never criticize China, right? They never… It’s Russia, Russia, Russia. I saw it today again. Russia, Russia. Oh, Russia. Here we go. That was another great scam. I’ve been involved in the two greatest scams in American history, the Russian hoax, and now they are trying to steal an election from us. We won not by a little bit. We won in numbers like nobody’s seen before. If Ossoff and Warnock are elected, they will immediately [inaudible 00:18:12] and you know what’s going to happen. They’ll throw open American borders and allow tens of millions of illegal immigrants to pour into our country from every corner of the globe. Your schools, your hospitals and your communities will be overwhelmed. And the wall, the wall, the wall. Remember, we’ll build a wall. We’re going to build a wall. And that’s right, Mexico is paying for the wall. If I were here, they would be, because we were going to charge them a nice fee, right at the entry points. They were paying for the wall. They paid for 28,000 troops along the wall and along the border, which we don’t need so much anymore, but we built almost 500 miles of wall and they want to rip down the wall. They want to rip down. It’s why the numbers have been so great. But now everyone’s coming back up because they think this guy’s going to win. If he wins, it’s going to be everything that they could dream for, dream of. We want to help other people, but we can’t afford to do it. We can’t afford to do it. So, they’re coming up now, the caravans. Remember the caravans? The caravans are starting to form. Here they come. But let’s keep this thing going. We have great support in Congress. We have good support in the Senate. I wouldn’t say great. Could be better. But people will remember the people that don’t support us. If they win this race, Democrats will implement nationwide catch and release. You know what that is? You catch a criminal and you take his name. You say, “You’re released into our country.” I ended it. You’re released. Come back in four years. We’re going to take you to court. So far nobody’s ever shown up. I mean, literally they almost don’t show up. That’s when I had the big debate with Biden. They come back for court. I said, “No, they don’t.” I turned out to be right. Did they apologize? I don’t think so. And turn our entire country into one giant sanctuary for criminal aliens, setting loose tens of thousands of dangerous offenders and putting MS13 gang members straight into your children’s schools. We’ve removed thousands and thousands of MS13 gang members. I want to thank ICE and I want to thank Border Patrol, and I want to thank our great law enforcement. Incredible people. They’re incredible. The people that understand those values are Kelly and David. They understand those values. You’re with our law enforcement, right? A hundred percent. I don’t have to ask her that. They’ll allow heroin, cocaine, fentanyl, and other deadly drugs to flood across our borders again, and poison our youth. They’ll take away your healthcare. They’ll eliminate private insurance. We have 180 million people that love their private insurance. You can forget about it. You’ll lose your doctor. Remember President Obama said, “You can keep your doctor. You can keep your plan.” Guess what? He said it 28 times. That was a lie. That was a lie. That turned out to be a big, great scam lie. Remember, I got rid of the individual mandate, the most unpopular thing in Obamacare, fighting a lot of different fronts, which really doesn’t make it Obamacare anymore, by the way. They’ll resume the war on Christians and attack Catholic organizations like Little Sisters of the Poor. They will ban voter ID. We want voter ID. Is that so much to ask? And institute universal, unsolicited mail-in balloting in every state. They will never be… I’ll tell you this. If we don’t do something fast, there will never be another fair election in America. We’re known for elections and now we’re being laughed out all over the world about this last election. You’ve got to swarm it tomorrow. Now, the good thing about tomorrow, it’s one state so you have a lot of eyeballs watching. It’s tougher than when you have 50 states and they do it to various states. I’ve never seen anything like it. I was leading in Pennsylvania by hundreds of thousands of votes. All of a sudden I was tied. I said, “What happened?” They’ll make Washington DC and other liberal places the 51st, 52nd, 53rd States of the Union guaranteeing the radical left a permanent majority of the U.S. Senate and the House and the electoral college. It will make it, really, a one party country, and the party will be the wrong party. They will pack the Supreme Court with crazed extremists and I’m not happy with the Supreme Court. They are not extremists. And I’m not happy with the Supreme Court. They are not stepping up to the plate. They’re not stepping up. How about that? Look at the Supreme Court, President of the United States. I want to file suit. I want to do… And they say, “Sir, you can’t, you really can’t do that.” Why? So they have legal reasons, complex legal reasons. It’s wrong. If you’re the President of the United States, and you get defrauded out of an election, you should be able to file a suit, but we can’t do that. They say, “Sir, you don’t have standing.” How about that? I’m the president, seven states, You know, I was winning by a lot. And then all of a sudden I was losing by a little, tiny bit, just a little, they can only go so far. They had no idea we were going to do the kind of numbers. So that printing press was really moving. And they say, I don’t have standing to bring a suit. What kind of a legal system is that? But the Supreme Court has led us down so far. Who knows? Maybe they’ll come back. Maybe they’ll come back. They’ll pack the Supreme Court with crazed extremists. Then there’ll be saying, “You know, I should have done something about this.” When they start having 24, 25, 26 justices, and they want to have the justices rotate to the lowest courts. So they’ll rotate. These nine justices will have a great time rotating, but they’re bent on destroying our constitution and overthrowing America’s founding. If the left wins these Senate seats, they will abolish the Senate. You know this. The filibuster, they will knock it out. I’ve been saying, to be honest with you for a long time, they’re going to do that, at some point, they’re going to do that. And why don’t we do it first? I said it. If they’re going to do it, you might as well do it first. And now everybody said, “You were right.” But you know what? I want to be wrong, because I want these two to win. Because if they win, we don’t want to do it. It’s a bad thing for our country. But that would give them the power to ram through every diluted piece of left-wing legislation that they’ve ever wanted, that they’ve ever dreamt up. Your religious liberty will be gone. Your second amendment will be gone. Your borders and great new world will be gone. Your police departments will be gone as we know them, and your life savings will be gone. We’ll be like a large scale version of so many other countries that you look at. That are poverty. America as you know it will be over. And it will never, I believe, be able to come back again. It will be too far gone. Your vote tomorrow could lose, and it could be your last chance to save the America that we love. That’s why I’m here. I don’t want to do rallies for other people. I told you. I’m here because of that. Because of David and Kelly, the far left wants to destroy our country, demolish our history, and erase everything that we hold dear. This could be the most important vote you will ever cast for the rest of your life. It really could be. This is so important. I mean, think of it. It’s so important. It’s amazing actually, that in one state you have two races simultaneously. I don’t think a thing like that’s ever happened before. If you don’t show up, the radical Democrats will win. A lot of people say, “Oh, well, Trump, maybe he wants it that way.” No. You know what I want? I want a great country. I want these two very special people to be elected. And I want to be clear. If those of you that know how badly screwed we got, I want to be clear that we can’t let that happen again. We can’t let that happen again. We’re going to come back, and I really believe we’re going to take what they did to us in November 3rd. We’re going to take it back. But these two people, they can’t go through this. They can’t go through it. If you don’t go and vote, the socialists, the Marxists, will be in charge of our country. If you don’t fight to save your country with everything you have, you’re not going to have a country left. I love this state. This state’s been very good to me. We’ve had a lot of victories in this state, just had one on November 3rd actually. And I love the people of this state. We can’t let that happen. The damage they do will be permanent, and will be irreversible. Can’t let it happen. Nothing and no one will be able to stop them. These Senate seats are truly the last line of defense. Now I must preface that by saying, because they’ll say, “He just conceded.” No, no, I concede. So Kelly, if I might add, I think we’re going to win, in which case we’ll be the last line of defense, it’s called veto, veto, veto. Veto. So tomorrow, you must get out and vote for David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. Over the last four years, David Purdue has been one of our greatest allies and strongest defenders in Washington. He’s a great gentlemen. David was a critical vote in the right to pass the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history. We did that together. We got it done, launching an incredible economic boom. The greatest tax cuts in the history of our country, think of it. And the greatest restrictions, we were so restricted we couldn’t breathe in this country. That’s one of the big, I think it might’ve been more important in many ways than the tax cuts. You would know that being one of the great businessmen of our world. I think it was maybe more important. When Georgia needed a strong voice in Washington after Hurricane Michael, remember Hurricane Michael? And I was down here with David, but David Purdue led the charge to get the workers and farmers of your state the relief you deserved. He said, “Sir, can we get a billion dollars?” And I said, “We’re going to get it David. And we got it very fast.” And there was no mechanism to get it. You got hit with a hurricane like you have never seen before, came in from a location that is just very unique. It was a horrible thing. I was here for a long time with David, and he worked and his kin, his kin, the great Sonny Perdue, our Department of Agriculture, our Secretary of Agriculture was fantastic also, but we worked very hard, and we got the farmers and the businesses the money that they had to have. And now they’re thriving. David has also been one of the most courageous advocates fighting for an immigration system that defends American workers, American wages, American families, and American jobs. He led the effort in Congress to build the wall. That’s right. And Kelly helped on that she’s a little bit newer to the Senate, but she helped a lot. Those last moments you were there, without you it wouldn’t have happened, actually. Cracked out on deadly sanctuary cities, and chain migration and institute on parallel protection for our great citizens. He fought to help us replaced NAFTA disaster with the brand new USMCA, they said it couldn’t be done. A giant victory for Georgia, for workers, and for farmers all over our country. NAFTA was the worst trade deal probably ever signed. And that maybe has to exclude some of the crazy deals and things they did with China. We voted to confirm nearly 300 federal judges. We have a record on federal judges, and three Supreme Court justices, which is a tremendous thing. We have almost 300 federal judges committed to interpreting our constitution as written. No one fights harder for the people of Georgia than David Purdue. David’s opponent, Jon Ossoff is an unhinged radical leftist. He’s not a senator. He’s not a senator. That’s not a Senator. Ossoff said that he’s very proud to be endorsed by socialist crazy Bernie Sanders. He’s weak on China. He promoted Chinese propaganda and then he failed to disclose his business ties to the Chinese communist party. Other than that, he’s a wonderful guy, right? Ossoff supports the largest tax hike in American history. If they get in, Warnock and Ossoff, if they get in, you’re going to have the largest tax increase that you’ve ever had. It’ll be the largest tax increase in the history of our country. For what? The Green New Deal, let’s rip down a building because its windows are too big. Let’s build a building with no windows. Among many other things. He supports the insane Green New Deal, which would crush middle-class parents trying to raise a family. He will support the socialist takeover of American healthcare, which will lead to rationing poverty and death. Ossoff also backed the radical left wing crusade to defund police. The last summer, he proudly joined the anti-police mob, he didn’t like the police. He doesn’t like our police. We love our police. Slandering our brave men and women in blue. If you vote for Jon Ossoff, he will attack our heroes. He will destroy our economy, and he will betray you and your family. And it’ll happen very quickly. That’s why you must vote. And really importantly, get out tomorrow. Vote for David Perdue. He’s a great gentleman. He loves you. Georgia has another fantastic champion in Senator Kelly Loeffler. Kelly is a staunch defender of our incredible military. I’m so proud of our military. She supports the wall, and she always stands with the heroes of law enforcement, ICE and border patrol. I hated it, Kelly, when we got ballots in from the military with Trump all over it, and they got thrown into a river, you saw that. They threw ballots into a river from the military with my name all over it. We want Trump. Boom, goes into the river. That was just one of many instances of problem. Kelly is also a committed protector of your second amendment rights. With Kelly’s vote, we confirmed our third new Supreme Court justice Amy Coney Barrett. Working with David, Kelly helped rescue the US economy from the China virus, passing nearly $4 trillion in economic relief, saving over 1.5 million Georgia jobs, and rescuing countless small businesses all across your state. Businesses that now are doing really well, and we also came up with a vaccine. Nobody else would have done that. They would have done that in 10 years. Kelly and David also both strongly support my efforts to provide $2,000 stimulus checks to hardworking Americans across Georgia, and across the nation. And my reasoning is simple. I mean, we’re conservative with money, but my reasoning is simple. You didn’t cause this problem, this problem was caused by China. Kelly is running against a hard left extremist named Raphael Warnock. Warnock is the most radical and dangerous left-wing candidate ever to seek this office, and certainly in the state of Georgia, and he does not have your values. Warnock has publicly declared his support for socialism, and he once welcomed the anti-American communist dictator, Fidel Castro to his church. He wanted him here. He liked Castro. Thought Castro was a nice guy. Warnock said that quote, nobody can serve both God and the military. A vicious smear against thousands of patriotic service members across the state of Georgia. He wants to abolish cash bail. You see how that’s working in New York City, right? It’s not working too well. He has called for quote, opening up the jails, and he slandered our police offices as gangsters, thugs, and bullies. The choice for the voters of Georgia could not be more clear. Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, are fringe extremists, who would wreck everything Georgia patriots hold dear to their hearts. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue share your values, and you know that. They share your values like nobody shares your values. I can tell you, they share your values. They want to defend your interest. And they will always put America first. Did you see the other day? What a great name, America First. They announced they don’t want to do the America First policy. How crazy? Even if you’re not going to do it, which is basically protect us. We come first. But even, and that includes financially in every other way. Even if you don’t believe it, you don’t say we’re going to end America First. They want to end America First. Kelly, I’d love you to just come up and say a few words. Would that be okay? Kelly. We love you. Thank you. Thank you Kelly. That was nice. I’m glad I invited her up. Kelly, I’m glad I invited you up. That was great. Thank you Kelly. That was so great. Thank you. Thank you. You know, it really is. It’s fight for our country. It’s really fight for our country, not fight for Trump. It’s fight for our country, because that’s why we’re fighting for. Also joining us tonight are Georgia representatives, Marjorie Taylor Greene. I love Marjorie Taylor too. Where are you? Come up here. Kelly wants you to come up here. Don’t mess with her. Don’t mess with her. I also want to introduce two great warriors, friends of mine, Andrew Clyde and Jody Hice. Jody, thank you. Thank you, Andrew. Thank you very much. Great job. We have another friend of ours, South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham. And Mike Lee is here too, but I’m a little angry at him today. Where’s Mike Lee, Where is he? I’m a little angry at you today, but that’s… State representative Vernon Jones. What a great guy he is. A great man. And an early supporter of mine who’s also on the ballot tomorrow. Public service commissioner Bubba McDonald. Bubba. You’re going to do great. Great guy. Thank you, Bubba. Thank you. Good luck tomorrow. You’ll do well. Georgia Republican party chairman David Schaefer, and he’s fighting. He’s out there. He is fighting. He is fighting. By the way, I also want to say hello to, Kelly’s husband is one of the great entrepreneurs in our country. He’s respected by everybody. He’s a tough guy, but he is a sweetheart, and he loves your state. I just want to say hello. Do you mind? Okay. He doesn’t want that. He doesn’t want it, but I will tell, you he’s respected as a businessman, respected by everybody, and gives tremendous amounts of money to charity and everything else. Thank you very much. Also a friend of mine, and I don’t know what it is. I’m not so good with the bikes. I sort of say, maybe I stay away from it a little bit, but Chris Cox is Bikers for Trump. And he’s the founder, and he had more people show up for me. Whenever I saw, I’d go to places, I’d have two, three, 4,000 bikes, and secret service would go crazy. I’d say, “No, I’m so happy.” And they wouldn’t do it for any other reason. They just wanted to protect their future president. This was before I won, they were with me for whatever reason, bikers like me. And I like them. Chris Cox, wherever you are Chris Cox. Where is Chris? I don’t know why the bikers like me, Chris, but they do. But I like you guys a lot, and you’re great. We go to speeches and we’d be packed, and we couldn’t even get them, they didn’t even want to be inside. They stood outside. And they were protecting their president when I became president, I never felt safer in my life. Thank you. That’s true. Another man who’s respected by everybody, a friend of mine. David McIntosh Club for Growth. David, David. Thank you, David. Respected by everybody. And I want to thank Don Jr. Did he do a good job tonight? I watched. Where is Don? Don is great. I love Don. They love our Don, but he’s working hard, and I want to thank Don and Kimberly Guilfoyle, who is incredible. And I also came with somebody who people like a lot, people like her a lot. I don’t know. She doesn’t really like the concept of running for office. She says, “What do I need it for, dad?” Ivanka. Where’s Ivanka? Come on, come, come. Should we get Ivanka up yes, right? Come on up here honey. Thank you Ivanka. Thanks Don. Kimberly, everybody. Thank you all. Tomorrow our entire nation is counting on the people of Georgia in a way the world is counting on the people of Georgia. The fate of our country is at stake. It’s in your hands. You must deliver a Republican victory so big that the Democrats can’t steal it or cheat it away. We have all … They’ll be trying though, I’ll tell you that. We have all seen what our opponents are capable of doing. I ran two elections. I won both of them. Second one, much more successful than the first, but we can’t let this happen any longer. On election night, we were leading by so much. We’re not going to have that tomorrow. We’re not going to have that tomorrow night, where you’re leading and then all of a sudden, boom, it’s gone like magic. We won Florida and Ohio in record numbers. We won Iowa by 8.2%. Nobody’s ever won those three States and lost. Never happened before. It’s almost impossible unless people do a lot of … Either get very lucky or they cheat. We’re up 293,000 votes in Michigan, 112,000 votes in Washington. In Wisconsin we were way up, 356,000 votes. In Georgia, 356,000 and 700,000 votes in Pennsylvania. It was over. I should have run up to the podium and said, thank you very much for this wonderful victory. Then maybe they wouldn’t have had time to close those booths, the counting rooms, and do what they did. But then it all started to disappear. I tell this story because we can’t let this happen tomorrow, Kelly. So keep your eyes open. Since the election, we have put forth indisputable evidence documenting the rampant fraud, which will be announced on Wednesday as you know. And I want to thank Senator Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz and all of the incredible senators that have stepped up to fight, because they’ve seen what happens. They know it’s a fraud and not just here. I watched some of the people on Fox. I had no choice. I had no choice. I had to. I didn’t have enough channels. And they said, “Why is he fighting for Georgia? It’s not enough.” And I need three. I’m fighting in eight, actually, but six and we’re going to win them all. But they said, “Why?” So one of the people, a very fine woman actually, but she said, “Why is he fighting Georgia? It doesn’t get him there.” I said, “No, but Georgia and Pennsylvania and one other get me there. And we have six and maybe eight, if you look at them and we were leading all of them by a lot, until, like a miracle, it started to quickly disappear.” Right here in Georgia there were tens of thousands of illegal votes cast and counted. You know that. And here are just a few examples. Watch this for tomorrow. We were up 10,315 ballots were cast by individuals whose name and date of birth matches a Georgia resident who died in 2020 prior to the election. Then your wacky secretary of state said two people, two people. Now, I don’t know how many people are on that list, but it’s a lot of people. 2,506 ballots were cast by individuals whose name and date of birth matches an incarcerated felon in a Georgia prison. Maybe they aren’t all there, but they did a lot of work. They paid a lot of money to a lot of people. I can tell you that. 4,502 illegal ballots were cast by individuals who do not appear on the state’s voter rolls. Well, that’s sort of strange. 18,325 illegal ballots were cast by individuals who registered to vote using an address listed as vacant according to the postal service. At least 86,880 ballots were cast by people whose registrations were illegally backdated. Oh, I can’t believe that happened. 66,000 votes … You have to understand, we’re down by a little more than 11,000. So every one of these is determinative. 66,000 votes in Georgia were cast by people under the legal voting age. At least 15,000 ballots were cast by individuals who moved out of the state prior to the November 3rd election, or maybe they moved back in. I don’t know. I mean, I can’t tell. They moved out, ah, let’s go back. Usually takes a little time, right? We moved out. Let’s go back, darling. Georgia’s absentee ballot rejection rate went from an average of 3% in 2016, and then went down very low to almost zero now. Think of it, almost zero. If you multiply that out. And this is with many, many more ballots pouring in. Went to almost zero. 48 out of 159 counties in Georgia rejected no ballots at all. These absentee ballot rejection rates prove that the tens of thousands of illegitimate ballots were counted. There were more absentee ballots in 2020 than ever before by [inaudible 00:53:36]. But magically far fewer ballots were rejected. This alone is more than enough to swing the election to us. This one thing. I’m going over individual. In all of the swing States. Now they’ll check this out and that’s fine, but you take a look at it. Officials, egregiously violated state laws in order to solicit, facilitate and promote cheating and theft on a scale never seen before. These crooked and incompetent official suspended signature verification. I said, I want you to go to Fulton County to check the signatures, because hundreds of thousands of ballots came in. I want you to check the signature to see if it compares to somebody that lived there two years, four years or six years ago. They don’t want to do it. The secretary of state and your incompetent governor. Although he thinks I’ve been a great president. They illegally flooded their States with absentee ballots and they deployed hundreds of elicit ballot drop boxes and corrupt Democrat run cities, among many other flagrant violations of law. They put these drop boxes there. And in a number of they’d be gone for three days. They’d take them up and where are they? Where are they? They were gone. Georgia secretary of state agreed to a litigation settlement, which is something that nobody’s ever seen one like this. I want to just tell you that Stacey Abrams took him to the cleaners. That drastically and illegally changed the states election procedures. They never got the mandated approval from your state legislature, who, by the way, you have some great people in your legislature. Some great, great people who agree with what we’re saying and even more so. But think of it. They never got the approval. You have to, by law, under the constitution, you can’t just do these deals and not get the approval and your secretary of state or whoever it was, made this horrible consent decree, horrible, which got rid of so much safety. It’s a disgraceful thing. And it was only approved by your local politicians, him, and local judges. You can’t do that. You have to have your state legislatures do it. That’s true with all States. Tens of thousands of votes are missing. We go all over the world telling people how to run their elections and we don’t even know how to run ours. The most unhappy person right now, anywhere in the United States is Hillary Clinton. Because she’s asking the Democrat party, why the hell didn’t you do this for me? True. Why didn’t you do it for me? Why the hell didn’t you? You notice how quiet she’s been? I shouldn’t have said that, not tonight Jill. But you notice how quiet … she’s furious, because she said, “Don’t forget, I won Michigan by 10,000 votes.” We did much better. As I said, this time. Much, much better, but I won Michigan from her by 10,000 votes. I won Wisconsin by a small … I mean, they could have done that one and not get caught. We caught him, we caught him. And I say to people like Mike Lee, that here at Lindsey, I say, if they got approved and verified, they use the word verified, votes that are fraudulent. And then we find out after, because you can’t do it that quickly. It doesn’t go that quickly. It’s a lot of work and a lot of votes and a lot of people. And then we find out that they were frauds like in one state where you had, let’s say you lost by 25,000 votes. They verify it. And that’s supposed to be the end. But shortly thereafter, we find out that we actually won the state by 250,000 votes. Does that mean that that state plus others adds up to being your president? I don’t think it should. I don’t think it should. I don’t think that Kelly feels it should. I don’t think that Marjorie feels it should. In Wisconsin over 90,000 ballots where illegally harvested. Can’t do that. Not allowed to. Through so-called human drop boxes and over 500 illegal unmanned drop boxes were put out statewide. In addition, over 170,000 absentee votes were counted that are blatantly illegal under Wisconsin law and should never have been included in the tally. By the way, I lost the … It was razor thin. There’s 170,000 votes. The margin in Wisconsin is only 20,000 votes. So this issue alone would have won that state for us many times over, we were leading at 10 o’clock in the evening by a lot. In Pennsylvania, there were 205,000 more ballots cast than there were voters. How do you get around that one? Which remains completely unexplained. You have great senators and representatives there and nobody can explain it, but think of that. And in other places too, you had more ballots than you had voters. You had more votes, think of it, then you had voters by a lot. In addition, Democrats, state Supreme court judges and Democrat secretary of state effectively abolished the signature verification process right here. They counted ballots cast after deadlines and they allowed ballots to be illegally fixed in Democrat controlled areas. And I say this because you can’t let this happen tomorrow. And I hope all the politicians are listening. There’s an unexplained 400,000 vote discrepancy between the number of mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania sent out reported on November 2nd, 2020. And the number reported on November 4th. They can’t explain it. 400,000 previously unreported mail-in ballots, magically appeared. They couldn’t explain it. And all of a sudden they just happened to find 400,000. That’s a lot of people. Amazing. And the Pennsylvania legislature is not happy. Pennsylvania also had an estimated 8,000 dead voters, 55,000 ballots received back before they were even sent. How about that? The ballots were received, but they weren’t sent yet. Oh, get them out fast please. Many more with no mail date and 14,000 ballots illegally cast by out of state voters. Those are the numbers and those are the numbers we got from them. So they can’t say, Oh, the numbers aren’t so good. In Clark County, Nevada, over 130,000 ballots, this is far, just so you know, all these numbers, these are far more than we need, we’re processed on machines where the signature matching threshold was intentionally lowered to a level that you could sign your name, Santa clause, and it wouldn’t pick it up. Didn’t pick up anything. More than 42,000 people in Nevada double voted. That’s more than we needed, by far. In Arizona more than 36,000 votes were cast by non citizens. And there were 11,000 more ballots than there were voters. It seems to be a trait, doesn’t it? This was like at the Super Bowl, where you have 15 cameras and they’d say camera number four, you’re on. Camera number three, you’re on. In Michigan, according to one analyst, over 35,000 ballots listed no address, over 13 ballots were cast by non-residents and an estimated 17,000 ballots were cast by dead people. Some dead people, by the way, also requested an application through. Those are the ones that really bothered me. They not only vote, but they request an application. That’s a double. In addition, there is the highly troubling matter of Dominion voting machines. And I want you to watch this very carefully tomorrow everybody, you have to watch it carefully. I want to read you from a letter from Georgia state Senator William Ligon. You know who he is, right? Highly respected guy. “Dear Mr president, as chairman of the Georgia Senate judiciary committee on elections. I request that you immediately send an outside team of cyber experts to investigate potential hacking and other irregularities associated with Dominion voting systems, scanners, ballot marking devices, ballots, polling pads used in the 2020 general election in Georgia.” You don’t hear this from your secretary of state and you don’t hear this from your governor and you do have a great legislature. I have to tell you, but the governor won’t let him hold the session to decertify. On December 30th, 2020, the committee held a hearing investigating potential fraud and other irregularities during Georgia’s 2020 general election. The committee first unanimously approved a report dated December 17th, 2020, discussing a myriad of voting irregularities and potential fraud in Georgia 2020 general election, disgusted in an earlier hearing held on December 3rd. Notably the committee stated in the executive summary that the November 3rd 2020 general election was chaotic and reported results must be viewed as untrustworthy. They are untrustworthy, despite the line of crap that you hear from these people that represent you. I don’t know where they come from. The committee then heard, and this is from one of your most highly respected political representatives, the committee then heard additional testimony concerning voting irregularities during the 2020 general election, including testimony and a real time test demonstrating serious irregularities with Dominion’s voting machines. Three events discussed at this hearing standout and require a forensic auditor of the Dominion voting machines in Georgia to be immediately conducted. The governor will not let us do it. We’ve been asking them now since November 4th, the day after the election, he won’t let us do it. Why won’t he let us do it? There’s only one reason I can think of. First the Dominion voting machines employed in Fulton County. That’s the home of Stacey. Had an astounding 93.67 error rate. 93.67 error rate in the scanning of ballots requiring a review panel to adjudicate or determine the voters intent. So they’re going to a voter intent. What did the voter mean by this vote? Somebody votes for Trump. I think that voter meant something other. He doesn’t want Trump. Let’s just switch it around. Think of that. They’re trying to determine the voters intent in over 106,000 ballots out of a total of 113,000 ballots. This is from your representative, highly respected. The national average for such an error rate is far less than 1.2%. So, that was 93%. The source of this astronomical error rate must be identified to determine if these machines were set up were designated to allow for a third party to disregard the actual ballot cast by the registered voter. This is what I have. There was no way. Look at this crowd we have here. Biden came here. He had nobody. Gallup, Gallup. You know, the Gallup poll. They did a … I don’t say this braggingly, the most admired man in the world or the country. I don’t say it. I say it for a different reason. So, I came in first. Obama came in second and Biden came in way low. Then I say, and they say, and people have said, how is it possible that a guy who got 80 million votes can’t get any votes for the most admired man. You know why? Because he didn’t come in first. That’s why. Second, again from this very respected political leader, second, there is clear evidence that tens of thousands of votes were switched from president Trump to former vice president Biden in several counties throughout Georgia. For example, in Bibb County, anybody live in Bibb County? Bibb, Bibb, B-I-B-B. President Trump was reported to a 29,391 votes at 9:11 PM, while simultaneously former vice-president Joe Biden was reported to have 17,000 to 18. Minutes later at the next update these vote numbers switched with president Trump now having 17,000. And Biden now having 29,391. That was a switch of over 12,000 votes. It was like a miracle. Third, during this hearing, a presenter demonstrated that a Dominion Poll could be hacked into in real time because it was connected to the internet. Now, anything connected to the internet, that’s not good, but this demonstration proved that these machines could allow votes to be siphoned off or added during the voting process because they’re connected to the internet. Cybersecurity experts agree that voting machines should not be connected to the internet at any time and in any way, shape or form. Did you see that during the hearing? This guy sitting there. Well, can you connect into the machines? Yes. How do you do that? Within about 25 seconds, he controlled the internet. Former vice-president Biden led Georgia by only 11,779 votes. Every one of the things I told you about almost is more votes than what we’re talking about. The crime that was committed in this state is immeasurable and immediate forensic audit of an appropriate sampling of Dominion’s voting machines and related equipment is critical to determine the level of illegal fraudulent ballots, improperly counted in Georgia during the 2020 general election and during tomorrow’s race. You’ve got to be very careful. And, let me also quickly read a letter from Mark Finchem, chairman of the Arizona House, a very respected man, Federal Relations Committee. “Dear Mr. President, subsequent to the election, members of the legislature were inundated with complaints from constituents relating to the intensity of the general election, and the integrity more important than anything else, and the accuracy of canvassed results.” “In many instances, constituents reported that their earlier in-person ballots may not have been correctly processed, or tabulated in Maricopa County officials.” “Members of the legislature have conducted two public hearings in recent weeks during which significant evidence of fraudulent and illegal voting in Arizona has been demonstrated through expert and eyewitness testimony, for example, in Pima County and Maricopa County, it appears that 143,000 illegal votes were actually injected into the ballot system.” Think of that. No, but think of this. Also, the press won’t report this, they probably turn it off, oh, we don’t like this. They don’t like this. They don’t want to talk about numbers. They talked about my phone call. They don’t like my phone call, everyone loved my phone call. They don’t like talking about numbers, because nobody knew the numbers were so egregious. Also, an expert mathematician concluded that the only explanation for the actual voting results in Arizona is that 100%… Think of this, 130% of Democrats voted for candidate Biden, and a negative 30% voted for President Trump. Now, think of that. In order to get to the numbers 130% of the voters, that’s a little tough to get, okay, had to vote for him, and minus 30 had to vote for me, and that gets you to a 100%. And, nobody has a 100% voting. For all of these people who think it’s too late, does that mean that we’re forced to approve a fraudulent election or an election with massive irregularities? I don’t think so. [crosstalk 01:11:32] I don’t think so. I want to thank those two great political leaders, but we have many other letters just like that. Same thing. Hundreds of thousands of votes are missing. The only way to combat the Democrat fraud is to flood your polling places with a historic tidal wave of Republican voters tomorrow. Because at a certain point, the machines are going to explode. They almost did with me, unfortunately they didn’t quite get there, but we’ll figure that out. And, I just want Mike Lee to listen to this when I’m talking, because you know what? We need his vote. This election is your chance to stand up to the corrupt Democrat machine, and show them that the American people are still in charge. With your help over the last four years, we built the greatest political movement in the history of our country. There’s never been anything like this. Kelly, when did I say, we’ll do this, like two days ago, three days ago, right? And, look at this, and we love you all for being here, we really do. I’m glad the weathers good, we love you all. But, there’s never been a movement like this. I say it all the time, and the politicians, the lame stream medias, I call them affectionately, if that weren’t true they’d say, “That’s wrong, there’s never been a movement like this.” I mean, you have people that won one state, and they become world famous for the rest of their lives. You have people that came in second in New Hampshire and their [inaudible 00:04:06], we won everything and we won it now a second time. Hate to bore you with that expression. But, we won it now a second time. And, I don’t want to win it a third time, I really want to win it the second time, [inaudible 00:04:18]. Somebody came up to me today, Kelly, and they said, “Sir, you way up in four years, nobody can come close to me.” I said, “I’m not interested in four years, I’m interested in like eight weeks ago.” Four years is a long time. It’s actually two in two, we’ll take back the house for [crosstalk 01:13:42] Kevin and Marjorie. Jodi, we’ll bring back the house, right? We’ll bring back the house. No, we didn’t win, I’d be all upset. Of course, If I didn’t win, you probably wouldn’t want me, you know in all. A Big difference between losing and winning and having it stolen. No, but they talk about for years, sir, you haven’t made, nobody can come closer and I say, “Nope, we go this way first.” And, I think we’re going to do it. I really believe, because there’s no [crosstalk 01:14:23] way we could have won every single state, and for Fox, not one state, this is one of many. We win every state, and they’re going to have this guy be president and he can’t speak, he can’t talk. Already, we’ve achieved more than anyone thought possible. And, we are just getting started. And honestly, it’s you, it’s amazing what happened. I don’t even know why the hell I say let’s have a rally. We have a rally and thousands and thousands [inaudible 01:14:51] Honestly, I’ll go out on the extreme, there’s never been anything like this in the history of our country. And, the election is over, the presidential election, and we have a big one tomorrow, but there’s never been anything like this in the history of our country. Our economy is coming back. It’s roaring back. Our stock market is an all time high. Who would have thought that? We’re rounding the turn, because of what we did with the vaccines. And, nobody else would have done it, it would have taken so long. The economy boomed at 33. 4% last quarter, that’s the fastest rate ever recorded. And, we’re talking about [crosstalk 01:15:37] pandemic during a pandemic. We’ve already slashed the unemployment rate in half. And for decades, our politicians spend trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign wars and defending foreign borders. You know, we’re bringing many of our great troops home. I mean, I hate to say it, but got to do it. We’ve been in Afghanistan for 19 years, I think that’s enough. I think that’s enough. We’ve got very few left and [crosstalk 01:16:09] very proud. Nothing worse than going to Dover and meeting the parents of our great warriors that have fallen, our great warriors coming home so badly wounded or dead. And, on countries that many of you have never even heard about. So, we bring our soldiers home. We’ve been incredible warriors, we can beat anybody. Nobody has our equipment, nobody has our military, nobody has our people, but we aren’t over there to be policemen. We’re not over there to be policing, they’re warriors, they’re fighters, and that’s what we want them for. That’s what we have to have them for. But, we brought a lot of them home. We are finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities and we’re bringing our jobs, our factories and our troops back to the USA where they belong. But everything that we’ve achieved together is on the line tomorrow. Our fight to take back our country from the big donors, the big media and the horrendous big tech giant that our politicians, not these two politicians, are afraid to attack. Section 230, we have to get rid of Section 230 politiains or you’re not going to have a country very long, taken away all your rights. If you want to send a message to the powerful forces that are trying to control your country, you must get out and vote tomorrow for David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. With your help, we’re going to continue our mission to save America, and we’re going to continue our mission of America first. It’s very simple. Each of us here tonight is United by the same core vision, and the same timeless American values. We love our country. Together, we believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy are the center of American life. We will defend the right to life, [crosstalk 01:18:19] religious Liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms, which they want to take away from you. And, we will always support the heroes of law enforcement. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might, and we will preserve peace through strength. You know when I first got elected and before I got elected in 2015 and 2016, before they were in debates and everyone said, “Oh, he’s going to cause Wars, he’s going to cause wars.” I think I’m the only president in many, many decades that didn’t [crosstalk 01:19:00] get into a war, right. Remember North Korea was going to be a tremendous nuclear fight, and all this, what happened with that? I got along very well with Kim Jong-un. I don’t think that Joe’s going to based on what I’ve heard, but I got along very well with him. And people say, “Whatever happened with North Korea, we got along well.” But, they all said that, “With my personality, I’ll be in a big war very soon within the first two weeks.” What happened? And, they don’t want to mess with us either, that [crosstalk 01:19:35] I can tell you. David and Kelly will protect Social Security and Medicare, and they will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. And, we will live by the words of our national motto, In God We Trust, and it will stay that way. From Atlanta to Augusta, to Savannah, to Columbus, from Athens… And, I want to say hello to Herschel Walker, Athens. Herschel [crosstalk 01:20:28]. 10.2 yards of carry for a while, he made a lot of quarterbacks look very good. We love Hershel. To right here in Dalton, Georgia, we inherit the legacy of generations of American Patriots who gave their blood, sweat and tears to defend our country and to defend our freedom. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, settle the continent, tamed the wilderness, laid down the railroads, raised up the great skyscrapers that won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America into the single greatest nation in the history of the world, and the best is yet to come. And, proud citizens like you helped build this country. And, together we are taking back our country, our fight to drain the Washington swamp and reclaim America’s destiny and dignity has only just begun. We will not bend, we will not break, we will not yield. We will never give in, we will never give up, we will never back down. We will never, ever surrender. Because, we are Americans [crosstalk 01:21:56] and we are from Georgia and our hearts bleed red, white and blue. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And, together with the incredible people of Georgia, we have made America powerful again, our military. We have made America wealthy again, our stock market. We have made America strong again, we have made America proud again, we’re proud of our country. We have made America safe again, and we will make America great again. Go get him, David, go get him, Kelly, go get them tomorrow.

"2","01-06-21","I know your pain. I know you’re hurt. We had an election that was stolen from us. It was a landslide election, and everyone knows it, especially the other side, but you have to go home now. We have to have peace. We have to have law and order. We have to respect our great people in law and order. We don’t want anybody hurt. It’s a very tough period of time. There’s never been a time like this where such a thing happened, where they could take it away from all of us, from me, from you, from our country. This was a fraudulent election, but we can’t play into the hands of these people. We have to have peace. So go home. We love you. You’re very special. You’ve seen what happens. You see the way others are treated that are so bad and so evil. I know how you feel. But go home and go home at peace."
"3","01-07-21","I would like to begin by addressing the heinous attack on the United States Capitol. Like all Americans, I am outraged by the violence, lawlessness and mayhem. I immediately deployed the National Guard and federal law enforcement to secure the building and expel the intruders. America is and must always be a nation of law and order. The demonstrators who infiltrated the Capitol have defiled the seat of American democracy. To those who engaged in the acts of violence and destruction, you do not represent our country. And to those who broke the law, you will pay. We have just been through an intense election and emotions are high, but now tempers must be cooled and calm restored. We must get on with the business of America. My campaign vigorously pursued every legal avenue to contest the election results. My only goal was to ensure the integrity of the vote. In so doing, I was fighting to defend American democracy. I continue to strongly believe that we must reform our election laws to verify the identity and eligibility of all voters and to ensure faith and confidence in all future elections. Now Congress has certified the results. A new administration will be inaugurated on January 20th. My focus now turns to ensuring a smooth, orderly and seamless transition of power. This moment calls for healing and reconciliation. 2020 has been a challenging time for our people. A menacing pandemic has upended the lives of our citizens, isolated millions in their homes, damaged our economy, and claimed countless lives. Defeating this pandemic and rebuilding the greatest economy on earth will require all of us working together. It will require a renewed emphasis on the civic values of patriotism, faith, charity, community, and family. We must revitalize the sacred bonds of love and loyalty that bind us together as one national family. To the citizens of our country, serving as your president has been the honor of my lifetime. And to all of my wonderful supporters, I know you are disappointed, but I also want you to know that our incredible journey is only just beginning. Thank you. God bless you, and God bless America.

"4","01-12-21","Thank you very much. Thank you, everybody. Great honor to be here. We’ve worked long and hard. Please sit down. We’ve worked long and hard to get this done. They said it couldn’t be done, and we got it done, one of the largest infrastructure projects in the history of our country. I’m honored to be here in the Rio Grand Valley with the courageous men and women of customs and border patrol. These people are incredible. They’re really incredible. I’ve gotten to know you very well over the last four years. Many of you are friends from all of the work we did in designing the wall. We got it exactly as you wanted it, everything including your protective plate on top. I say, “Why did we put that?” And they said, “We need it for extra protection, climb plate,” and we have everything you want. It’s steel, it’s concrete inside the steel, and then it’s rebar, a lot of heavy rebar in side the concrete, and it’s as strong as you’re going to get and strong as you can have, but we gave you a 100% of what you wanted, so now you have no excuses. I didn’t want you to have any excuses. You set records, and we can’t let the next administration even think about taking it down, if you can believe that. I don’t think that will happen. I think when you see what it does and how it’s so important for our country, nobody’s going to be touching it, and you are very proud of it, and you’re proud of the work you did, because we really designed it together. We’re joined together to celebrate a great achievement, the extraordinarily successful building of the wall on the Southern border. Before we begin, I’d like to say that free speech is under assault like never before. The 25th Amendment is of zero risk to me but will come back to haunt Joe Biden and the Biden Administration. As the expression goes, be careful what you wish for. The impeachment hoax is a continuation of the greatest and most vicious witch hunt in the history of our country and is causing tremendous anger and division and pain far greater than most people will ever understand, which is very dangerous for the USA, especially at this very tender time. And now, I’d like to briefly address the events of last week. Millions of our citizens watched on Wednesday as a mob stormed the Capitol and trashed the halls of government. As I have consistently said throughout my administration, we believe in respecting America’s history and traditions, not tearing them down. We believe in the rule of law, not in violence or rioting. Because of the pandemic, horrible, horrible, invisible enemy, and despite our tremendous success developing a vaccine years before it was thought even remotely possible … Nobody thought it was going to be possible. They said it would take five years. “Sir, it will take seven years.” All of our scientists were saying, our advisers, “It will seven years, five years, 10 years, maybe.” Well, we did it just like I said we would, and we had it out years and years before they thought it was possible, and we’re now delivering it to states, including your state, where your governor and government are doing a terrific job in getting it administered in Texas. Florida’s doing great. Some of them are doing great. Some aren’t doing as well, but they have all they can handle, and we get it to them as fast as they need it and even faster. But they’re calling it a medical miracle, and this has been a difficult year and a very difficult election. The pandemic has made it a very, very difficult year for our country and virtually every country all over the world. Now is the time for our nation to heal, and it’s time for peace and for calm. Respect for law enforcement and the great people within law enforcement, so many are here, is the foundation of the MAGA agenda, and we’re a nation of law, and we’re a nation of order. That is why we’re law and we’re a nation of order. That is why we’re here today to talk about what we must do to uphold the rule of law in America and how we must continue to support our law enforcement heroes, which is exactly what you are. Do you feel like a hero? Yeah, I think you do. Right? You do and you are. I want to thank Customs and Border Patrol Commissioner, Mark Morgan, who’s been incredible. Where’s Mark? Mark, stand up, Mark. Great job. Fantastic. Chief Patrol Agent, Brian Hastings. Brian, thank you very much. Great job. He’s so happy. He said, “Sir, this really works.” And most importantly, the brave law enforcement officers who risk their lives every day to protect our families and our country. I also want to thank a tremendous gentleman, friend of mine, Tom Homan. He’s a great American patriot and he was with us right from the beginning. Right, Tom? You knew exactly … He said, “We need a wall,” when they were saying, “No, no. We need drones, we need drones.” I said, “Why? So you could watch the people pour into our country illegally?” And I want to thank you very much, Tom. What a professional job you’ve done. All of you people, incredible. Everyone here today is part of an incredible success story. This is a real success story. When I took office, we inherited a broken, dysfunctional, and open border. Everybody was pouring in at will. Working alongside the heroes in this great outdoor space, looking at our wall. We reformed our immigration system and achieved the most secure southern border in US history. It is at a level that it’s never been before. We took on the cartels, the coyotes and the special interests and we restored the rule of law. For years, politicians ran for office promising to secure the border, only to get elected and to do the absolute exact opposite. They even promised a wall, if you remember. About 10 years ago, they promised a wall, but they couldn’t get it built. It wasn’t easy getting it built. Getting it financed was tough. Getting it built was even tougher. All the different chains of title and all the different things we had to go through, very, very complex and very difficult, but we got it done, but they had it years ago, you remember that better than anybody, right? And they never got it done. They never, ever completed the task. And then, ultimately, the money was sent back to the federal government, spent, but no wall was built. But unlike those who came before me, I kept my promises. And today, we celebrate an extraordinary milestone, the completion of the promised 450 miles of border wall, 450 miles. Nobody realizes how big that is. I remember when I first came down about a year and a half ago, we’re under construction and I started walking. And I’m looking at the wall and I’m walking and walking. And I’m used to a development project where you could walk a wall; 10 acres, five acres, two acres, one acre. And I realized that’s a long time. That’s a big walk. A lot of the wall you have is incredibly natural. You have the mountains, you have the rives, you have some very powerful water areas, you have some areas that are virtually impossible to get by. So we didn’t need walls everywhere, but where we needed them … because it’s been so successful that we’ve added nearly 300 miles. And that’s currently under construction. This was our original wish, to get these areas done where there was such trouble. And now, we have it. It’s either in construction or in pre-construction, an additional 300 miles. In every region that we’ve built the wall, illegal crossings and drug smuggling have plummeted, absolutely plummeted. In the Rio Grande Valley, crossings have dropped nearly 80%. In Yuma, Arizona, illegal entries have been slashed by 90%. Nationwide, ICE and border patrol have seized over two million pounds of fentanyl, heroine, meth, and other deadly narcotics, saving thousands and thousands of lives. We’ve arrested nearly 500,000 illegal aliens with criminal records, some with very serious criminal records of the type you don’t want to know about, like murder. We removed nearly 20,000 gang members from the United States, including 4,500 members of MS13, probably the worst gang of them all. Through the landmark reforms we’ve put into place, we have ended the immigration chaos and reestablished American sovereignty. Our most important reform was ending catch and release. Not easy to do. You’re dealing with Congress. It’s very, very difficult, which is the functional equivalent of open borders, but even worse. It’s catch and release them. It means release into our country, not into another country. This policy was exploited by vicious criminal organizations who understood the laws better than our people understood them for years to spread misery and suffering and drugs all across the hemisphere. Now, instead of catch and release, we have detain and remove. It’s called detain and remove. Doesn’t that sound better? One of the biggest loopholes we closed was asylum fraud. Under the old, broken system, if you merely requested asylum, you were released into the country, the most ridiculous thing anyone’s ever seen. And we were taking in some people that you didn’t want to have in your country. We instituted a series of historic policy changes to shut down asylum fraud and that’s what we did. This includes the groundbreaking agreement with Mexico, known as the Migrant Protection Protocols or MPP. Under this agreement, if an illegal alien requests asylum, they have to wait in Mexico until their case is heard. They used to wait here. And when they were waiting, they would say, “Bye-bye,” and they’d disappear somewhere into our country. And essentially, we’d never find them again. We’d never see them again. This one measure, alone, ended a humanitarian crisis and saved countless lives and especially, I have to say, lives from crime. I want to thank the great President of Mexico. He is a great gentleman, a friend of mine, President Obrador. He is a man who really knows what’s happening and he loves his country and he also loves the United States, but I want to thank for his friendship and his professional working relationship. We actually had 27,000 Mexican soldiers guarding our borders over the last two years. Nobody thought that was possible. And they made it very, very difficult and that’s why the numbers were able to plunge, even during the construction of the wall. And by the way, one of the big elements of the wall that make it so successful is we can have far fewer people working now. They can be working on other things, other things related to crime and drug prevention and a lot of other elements they’re working on because we saved massive numbers of people. And included here, we have the most sophisticated camera systems and most sophisticated electronic systems anywhere in the world. We implemented three historic agreements with the Northern Triangle. That’s Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. Under these critical asylum cooperation agreements, the burden of illegal immigration is now shared all across the region. Now, when immigration is now shared all across the region. Now, when an illegal immigrant is arrested at our border, they can be sent to a neighboring country instead of into a US community. Prior to my getting here, countries wouldn’t accept them. They would say, “No, no, no.” I said, “Well, you got to take them.” First month, I’ll never forget these gentlemen right here came to me. They said, “They won’t take them back.” They came, they may be murderers, they may be cartel heads, they may be some really vicious people. The countries didn’t want them back. And I stopped all payments to those countries. I stopped everything going to those countries. And after it was stopped for about a month, you remember? After it was stopped for about a month, they called, they said, “We’d love to have them back.” And I never gave him as much money as they were getting by the way, but they got some. It was amazing. And you people know better than anyone, they wouldn’t take them back. Would have planes flying over, loaded up with people that we didn’t want here. And then say, “Don’t ever even think about landing that plane.” And they’d take them by boat and they’d take them by bus and they wouldn’t let them into their countries. And all of a sudden, they say, “Welcome back. We love having you.” So it was a great thing and now they do take them back. And the relationship with those countries, the triangle, the relationship is a much better one than it was before. In addition to our agreements with Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, we have systematically reformed the regulatory code to return asylum to its original legal meaning and purpose, not a free ticket for entry. A recent comprehensive report by the Department of Homeland Security and Justice show how effective our reforms have been and how disastrous their removal would be. It would be a disaster for our country. I know they’re thinking about removing them. I hope they don’t do that. I hope they don’t do that. It’ll be an absolute travesty for our country. The report conclusively proves once and for all that aliens released at the border remain at large in the country and do not return home. They won’t go home. And you rarely find them. It’s very tough to find them. So we have aliens released in our country, many of whom are serious criminals, and we’ve stopped that. Don’t ever start that process again. By contrast, under our policies, 98% of aliens that remain in DHS custody are removed. Simply put, if you entered the United States illegally, you are apprehended and immediately, safely removed from our country. Without this core principle, there is no border. There is no law. There is no water. My administration also instituted vital public health measures on the border in response to the China virus under Title 42 of the US code, illegal immigrants are being promptly removed to protect the health of border agents, other migrants in local communities, and the public at large. Removing these protections would invite a public health catastrophe of epic proportions. As you probably know, in Tijuana, various parts of Mexico, the COVID has got about 24 names. I can call it from COVID to China virus. I can call it the plague, I call it the China plague, a lot of different names. But we always call it the invisible enemy. But the invisible enemy has been very tough on Mexico and we have areas along the border where we’re in great shape, because right there, because of that, that we’re in great shape. But on the other side in Mexico, they’re suffering greatly with the virus. It’s been incredible what we’ve achieved, and we didn’t do the wall because of COVID. We did the wall because of security and drugs and other things, but it turned out that in the middle of it all, along came this horrible plague. We inherited a dangerously lawless border. The people that work here are unbelievably brave. I’ve seen what they have to endure, what they have to go through. They’re tough, they’re strong, and they’re great patriots, great Americans. We fixed it and we secured it. We empowered our wonderful ICE and border patrol to fulfill their oaths and they became sworn officers of the law and they love their job. It’s a tough job. It’s a nasty job. They’re not paid what they should be paid, to be honest, but we got you up. We got you up. But these are incredibly talented people. They could probably do a lot better in terms of economics than they do here, but they love what they do and they love their country. We also put into place vital measures to protect American workers, keep out terrorists, and stop the abuse of our welfare system. Where they’d come up, go in our welfare system, and live for years on American welfare without ever having a job. We also have, and we had, but we have them all the time, we have terrorists from the Middle East coming into our country through the southern border. That was before what you see right here, because it was easier to come into our country through the Southern border than it was through airports or any other means. So they’d land in South America and they’d work their way up and they’d come into our country. And these are not people from the countries that you would suspect. These are people from some very seriously dangerous places in the Middle East. And the numbers are far greater than anybody would understand, really far greater. Removing any of these would hamstring our workers, endanger our country, and cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars a year. No matter our party, we should all agree on the need to protect our workers, our families, and our citizens of all backgrounds, no matter who they are. In particular, if our border security measures are reversed, it will trigger a tidal wave of illegal immigration, a wave like you’ve never seen before. And I can tell you that already waves are starting to come up from 2000 and 1000 and 500 miles away. We see what’s coming, and they’re coming because they think that it’s gravy train at the end. It’s going to be a gravy train. Change the name from the caravans, which I think we came up with, to the gravy train, because that’s what they’re looking for. Looking for the gravy. This will be an unmitigated calamity for national security, public safety, and public health. It would destroy millions and millions of jobs and claim thousands of innocent lives. The policies I put into place are uniformly and strongly supported by the men and women of ICE and border patrol. We worked on them together, just like we did on the wall. We worked on the policies together because nobody knows this whole world better than the incredible people right in front of me. To terminate those policies is knowingly to put America in really serious danger and to override the great career experts that have worked so hard, those from DHS. At this very moment, smugglers and coyotes are preparing to surge the border if our policies are loosened or removed. They’re literally waiting, big, big groups of people. Some of them very unsavory, I might add. This is an entirely preventable tragedy, it’s waiting to happen. The safety of our nation must come before politics, we have many disagreements in the country. But we should all agree, the many disagreements in the country, but we should all agree the urgent need to secure our borders, protect our homeland, and allow law enforcement to fulfill its mission without political interference. ICE and border patrol agents swore a sacred oath to uphold the law, and no political appointees should ever order them to violate that oath. These are real experts. They really get it. And I’ll tell you who else gets it. The Hispanic population of our country gets it because not only did I win Texas in historic numbers, but I won border towns, which are largely Hispanic. And people were amazed to see that. And the numbers, they say, were, Governor of Texas called, great guy, great governor, called. He said, “You had numbers that nobody’s had since reconstruction.” Reconstruction means Civil War. And a largely Hispanic. They understand it better than anybody. And they want law enforcement to help them, help them live safe lives. The laws that Congress passed must be upheld. To the men and women of ICE, customs, and border protection, and all across DHS, law enforcement in general, you have earned the everlasting gratitude of our nation. You have no idea how much our nation loves you and respects you. I don’t think you do have an idea, but it’s true. I only hope and pray that your voice will be heard, honored, heeded, and respected long into the future. God bless you, God bless law enforcement, and God bless America. Thank you very much. Thank you. Great job.

"5","01-13-21","My fellow Americans, I want to speak to you tonight about the troubling events of the past week. As I have said, the incursion of the US Capitol struck at the very heart of our Republic. It angered and appalled millions of Americans across the political spectrum. I want to be very clear, I unequivocally condemn the violence that we saw last week. Violence and vandalism have absolutely no place in our country and no place in our movement. Making America Great Again has always been about defending the rule of law, supporting the men and women of law enforcement and upholding our nation’s most sacred traditions and values. Mob violence goes against everything I believe in and everything our movement stands for. No true supporter of mine could ever endorse political violence. No true supporter of mine could ever disrespect law enforcement or our great American flag. No true supporter of mine could ever threaten or harass their fellow Americans. If you do any of these things, you are not supporting our movement, you are attacking it and you are attacking our country. We can not tolerate it. Tragically, over the course of the past year made so difficult because of COVID-19, we have seen political violence spiral out of control. We have seen too many riots, too many mobs, too many acts of intimidation and destruction. It must stop. Whether you are on the right or on the left, a Democrat or a Republican, there is never a justification for violence, no excuses, no exceptions. America is a nation of laws. Those who engaged in the attacks last week will be brought to justice. Now I am asking everyone who has ever believed in our agenda to be thinking of ways to ease tensions, calm tempers, and help to promote peace in our country. There has been reporting that additional demonstrations are being planned in the coming days, both here in Washington and across the country. I have been briefed by the US Secret Service on the potential threats. Every American deserves to have their voice heard in a respectful and peaceful way. That is your First Amendment Right. But I cannot emphasize that there must be no violence, no law breaking and no vandalism of any kind. Everyone must follow our laws and obey the instructions of law enforcement. I have directed federal agencies to use all necessary resources to maintain order. In Washington, D.C., We are bringing in thousands of National Guard members to secure the city and ensure that a transition can occur safely and without incident. Like all of you, I was shocked and deeply saddened by the calamity at the Capitol last week. I want to thank the hundreds of millions of incredible American citizens who have responded to this moment with calm, moderation and grace. We will get through this challenge just like we always do. I also want to say a few words about the unprecedented assault on free speech we have seen in recent days. These are tense and difficult times. The efforts to censor, cancel and blacklist our fellow citizens are wrong and they are dangerous. What is needed now is for us to listen to one another, not to silence one another. All of us can choose by our actions to rise above the ranker and find common ground and shared purpose. We must focus on advancing the interests of the whole nation, delivering the miracle vaccines, defeating the pandemic, rebuilding the economy, protecting our national security and upholding the rule of law. Today, I am calling on all Americans to overcome the passions of the moment and join together as one American people. Let us choose to move forward united for the good of our families, our communities, and our country. Thank you. God bless you and God bless America.



















"
"6","01-19-21","My fellow Americans, four years ago we launched a great national effort to rebuild our country, to renew its spirit, and to restore the allegiance of this government to its citizens. In short, we embarked on a mission to make America great again for all Americans. As I conclude my term as the 45th President of the United States, I stand before you truly proud of what we have achieved together. We did what we came here to do, and so much more. This week we inaugurate a new administration and pray for its success in keeping America safe and prosperous. We extend our best wishes, and we also want them to have luck, a very important word. I’d like to begin by thanking just a few of the amazing people who made our remarkable journey possible. First, let me express my overwhelming gratitude for the love and support of our spectacular First Lady Melania. Let me also share my deepest appreciation to my daughter, Ivanka, my son-in-law Jared, and to Baron, Don, Eric, Tiffany, and Lara. You fill my world with light and with joy. I also want to thank Vice President Mike Pence, his wonderful wife, Karen, and the entire Pence family. Thank you as well to my chief of staff, Mark Meadows, the dedicated members of the White House staff, and the cabinet, and all of the incredible people across our administration who poured out their heart and soul to fight for America. I also want to take a moment to thank a truly exceptional group of people, the United States Secret Service. My family and I will forever be in your debt. My profound gratitude as well to everyone in the White House military office, the teams of Marine One and Air Force One, every member of the armed forces, and state and local law enforcement all across our country. Most of all, I want to thank the American people. To serve as your president has been an honor beyond description. Thank you for this extraordinary privilege. And that’s what it is, a great privilege and a great honor. We must never forget that while Americans will always have our disagreements, we are a nation of incredible, decent, faithful, and peace-loving citizens who all want our country to thrive and flourish and be very, very successful and good. We are a truly magnificent nation. All Americans were horrified by the assault on our capital. Political violence is an attack on everything we cherish as Americans. It can never be tolerated. Now more than ever, we must unify around our shared values and rise above the partisan rancor and forge our common destiny. Four years ago, I came to Washington as the only true outsider ever to win the presidency. I had not spent my career as a politician, but as a builder looking at open skylines and imagining infinite possibilities. I ran for president because I knew there were towering new summits for America just waiting to be scaled. I knew the potential for our nation was boundless as long as we put America first. So I left behind my former life and stepped into a very difficult arena, but an arena, nevertheless, with all sorts of potential if properly done. America had given me so much and I wanted to give something back. Together with millions of hardworking Patriots across this land, we built the greatest political movement in the history of our country. We also built the greatest economy in the history of the world. It was about America first because we all wanted to make America great again. We restored the principle that a nation exists to serve its citizens. Our agenda was not about right or left. It wasn’t about Republican or Democrat, but about the good of a nation, and that means the whole nation. With the support and prayers of the American people, we achieved more than anyone thought possible. Nobody thought we could even come close. We passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history. We slashed more job-killing regulations than any administration had ever done before. We fix our broken trade deals, withdrew from the horrible Trans-Pacific Partnership and the impossible Paris Climate Accord, renegotiated the one-sided South Korea deal. And we replaced NAFTA with the groundbreaking USMCA, that’s Mexico and Canada, a deal that’s worked out very, very well. Also and very importantly, we imposed historic and monumental tariffs on China, made a great new deal with China. But before the ink was even dry, we and the whole world got hit with the China virus. Our trade relationship was rapidly changing. Billions and billions of dollars were pouring into the US but the virus forced us to go in a different direction. The whole world suffered, but America outperformed other countries economically because of our incredible economy and the economy that we built. Without the foundations and footings, it wouldn’t have worked out this way. We wouldn’t have some of the best numbers we’ve ever had. We also unlocked our energy resources and became the world’s number one producer of oil and natural gas by far. Powered by these policies, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world. We reignited America’s job creation and achieved record-low unemployment for African-Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, women, almost everyone. Income soared, wages boomed. The American dream was restored and millions were lifted from poverty in just a few short years. It was a miracle. The stock market set one record after another, with 148 stock market highs during the short period of time, and boosted the retirements and pensions of hardworking citizens all across our nation. 401(k)s are at a level they’ve never been at before. We’ve never seen numbers like we’ve seen, and that’s before the pandemic and after the pandemic. We rebuilt the American manufacturing base, opened up thousands of new factories, and brought back the beautiful phrase Made in the USA. To make life better for working families, we doubled the child tax credit and signed the largest-ever expansion of funding for childcare and development. We joined with the private sector to secure commitments to train more than 16 million American workers for the jobs of tomorrow. When our nation was hit with the terrible pandemic, we produced not one, but two vaccines with record-breaking speed and more will quickly follow. They said it couldn’t be done, but we did it. They called it a medical miracle. And that’s what they’re calling it right now, a medical miracle. Another administration would have taken three, four, five, maybe even up to 10 years to develop a vaccine. We did it in nine months. We grieve for every life lost and we pledge in their memory to wipe out this horrible pandemic once and for all. When the virus took its brutal toll on the world’s economy, we launched the fastest economic recovery our country has ever seen. We passed nearly $4 trillion in economic relief, saved or supported over 50 million jobs, and slashed the unemployment rate in half. These are numbers that our country has never seen before. We created choice and transparency in healthcare, stood up to big pharma in so many ways, but especially in our effort to get favored nations clauses added, which will give us the lowest prescription drug prices anywhere in the world. We passed VA Choice, VA Accountability, Right to Try, and landmark criminal justice reform. We confirmed three new justices of the United States Supreme Court. We appointed nearly 300 federal judges to interpret our Constitution as written. For years, the American people pleaded with Washington to finally secure the nation’s borders. I am pleased to say, we answered that plea and achieved the most secure border in US history. We have given our brave border agents and heroic ICE officers the tools they need to do their jobs better than they have ever done before and to enforce our laws and keep America safe. We proudly leave the next administration with the strongest and most robust border security measures ever put into place. This includes historic agreements with Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, along with more than 450 miles of powerful new wall. We restored American strength at home and American leadership abroad. The world respects us again. Please don’t lose that respect. We reclaimed our sovereignty by standing up for America at the United Nations and withdrawing from the one-sided global deals that never served our interests. And NATO countries are now paying hundreds of billions of dollars more than when I arrived just a few years ago. It was very unfair. We were paying the cost for the world. Now the world is helping us. And perhaps most importantly of all, with nearly $3 trillion, we fully rebuilt the American military, all made in the USA. We launched the first new branch of the United States Armed Forces in 75 years, the Space Force. And last spring, I stood at Kennedy Space Center in Florida and watched as American astronauts returned to space on American rockets for the first time in many, many years. We revitalize our alliances and rallied the nations of the world to stand up to China like never before. We obliterated the ISIS caliphate and ended the wretched life of its founder and leader al-Baghdadi. We stood up to the oppressive Iranian regime and killed the world’s top terrorist, Iranian butcher, Qassem Soleimani. We recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. As a result of our bold diplomacy and principled realism, we achieved a series of historic peace deals in the Middle East. Nobody believed it could happen. The Abraham Accords opened the doors to a future of peace and harmony, not violence and bloodshed. It is the dawn of a new Middle East, and we are bringing our soldiers home. I am especially proud to be the first president in decades who has started no new wars. Above all, we have reasserted the sacred idea that in America the government answers to the people. Our guiding light, our North star, our unwavering conviction has been that we are here to serve the noble everyday citizens of America. Our allegiance is not to the special interests corporations or global entities, it’s to our children, our citizens, and to our nation itself. As president my top priority, my constant concern has always been the best interests of American workers and American families. I did not seek the easiest course. By far, it was actually the most difficult. I did not seek the path that would get the least criticism. I took on the tough battles, the hardest fights, the most difficult choices because that’s what you elected me to do. Your needs were my first and last unyielding focus. This, I hope, will be our greatest legacy. Together, we put the American people back in charge of our country. We restored self-government. We restored the idea that in America no one is forgotten because everyone matters and everyone has a voice. We fought for the principle that every citizen is entitled to equal dignity, equal treatment, and equal rights because we are all made equal by God. Everyone is entitled to be treated with respect, to have their voice heard, and to have the government listen. You are loyal to your country and my administration was always loyal to you. We worked to build a country in which every citizen could find a great job and support their wonderful families. We fought for the communities where every American could be safe and schools where every child could learn. We promoted a culture where our laws would be upheld, our heroes honored, our history preserved, and law-abiding citizens are never taken for granted. Americans should take tremendous satisfaction in all that we have achieved together. It’s incredible. Now, as I leave the white house, I have been reflecting on the dangers that threaten the priceless inheritance we all share. As the world’s most powerful nation, America faces constant threats and challenges from abroad. But the greatest danger we face is a loss of confidence in ourselves, a loss of confidence in our national greatness. A nation is only as strong as its spirit. We are only as dynamic as our pride. We are only as vibrant as the faith that beats in the hearts of our people. No nation can long thrive that loses faith in its own values, history, and heroes for these are the very sources of our unity and our vitality. What has always allowed America to prevail and triumph over the great challenges of the past has been an unyielding and unashamed conviction in the nobility of our country and its unique purpose in history. We must never lose this conviction. We must never forsake our belief in America. The key to national greatness lies in sustaining and instilling our shared national identity. That means focusing on what we have in common, the heritage that we all share. At the center of this heritage is also a robust belief in free expression, free speech, and open debate. Only if we forget who we are and how we got here could we ever allow political censorship and blacklisting to take place in America. It’s not even thinkable. Shutting down free and open debate violates our core values and most enduring traditions. In America, we don’t insist on absolute conformity or enforce rigid orthodoxies and punitive speech codes. We just don’t do that. America is not a timid nation of tame souls who need to be sheltered and protected from those with whom we disagree. That’s not who we are. It will never be who we are. For nearly 250 years in the face of every challenge, Americans have always summoned our unmatched courage, confidence, and fierce independence. These are the miraculous traits that once led millions of everyday citizens to set out across a wild continent and carve out a new life in the great West. It was the same profound love of our God-given freedom that willed our soldiers into battle and our astronauts into space. As I think back on the past four years, one image rises in my mind above all others. Whenever I traveled all along the motorcade route, there were thousands and thousands of people. They came out with their families so that they could stand as we passed and proudly wave our great American flag. It never failed to deeply move me. I knew that they did not just come out to show their support of me. They came out to show me their support and love for our country. This is a republic of proud citizens who are united by our common conviction, that America is the greatest nation in all of history. We are and must always be a land of hope, of light, and of glory to all the world. This is the precious inheritance that we must safeguard at every single turn. For the past four years, I have worked to do just that. From a great hall of Muslim leaders in Riyadh to a great square of Polish people in Warsaw, from the floor of the Korean Assembly to the podium at the United Nations General Assembly, and from the forbidden city in Beijing to the shadow of Mount Rushmore, I fought for you. I fought for your family. I fought for our country. Above all, I fought for America and all it stands for, and that is safe, strong, proud, and free. Now, as I prepare to hand power over to a new administration at noon on Wednesday, I want you to know that the movement we started is only just beginning. There’s never been anything like it. The belief that a nation must serve its citizens will not dwindle, but instead, only grows stronger by the day. As long as the American people hold in their hearts, deep and devoted love of country, then there is nothing that this nation can not achieve. Our communities will flourish. Our people will be prosperous. Our traditions will be cherished. Our faith will be strong and our future will be brighter than ever before. I go from this majestic place with a loyal and joyful heart, an optimistic spirit, and a supreme confidence that for our country and for our children, the best is yet to come. Thank you and farewell. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.

"7","01-20-21","Thank you, thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much, and we love you. And I can tell you that from the bottom of my heart, this has been an incredible four years. We’ve accomplished so much together. I want to thank all of my family, and my friends, and my staff, and so many other people for being here. I want to thank you for your effort, your hard work. People have no idea how hard this family worked. They worked. And they worked for you. They could have had a much easier life, but they just did a fantastic job, I just want to thank all of you, everyone. I want to thank Mark Meadows, who’s here someplace right there. I want to thank Mark., But it’s been been something very special. We’ve accomplished a lot. Our First Lady has been a woman of great grace and beauty and dignity. And so popular with the people. So popular with the people. In fact, honey, would you like to say a few words? What else has to be said, right? But what we’ve done… That’s true, honey. Great job. What we’ve done has been amazing by any standard. We rebuilt the United States military. We created a new force called Space Force. That in itself would be a major achievement for a regular administration. We were not a regular administration. We took care of the vets, 91% approval rating. They’ve never had that before. The vets have given us, the VA, the vets have given us an approval rating like has never been before. We took care of our vets, and our beautiful vets. They were very badly treated before we came along. And as you know, we get them great service and we pick up the bill, and they can go out and they can see a doctor if they have to wait long periods of time. We got it so that we can sadly get rid of people that don’t treat our vets properly. We didn’t have any of those rights before when I came on. So our vets are happy. Our people are happy. Our military is thrilled. We also got tax cuts, the largest tax cut and reform in the history of our country by far. I hope they don’t raise your taxes, but if they do, I told you so. And if you look at the regulations, which I consider the regulation cuts to be maybe even more important, that’s why we have such good and have had such good job numbers. And job numbers have been absolutely incredible. When we started, had we not been hit by the pandemic, we would have had numbers that would never have been seen. Already, our numbers are the best ever. If you look at what happened until February a year ago, our numbers were at a level that nobody had ever seen before. And even now, we really built it twice. We got hit. Nobody blames us for that. The whole world got hit, and then we built it again. And now the stock market is actually substantially higher than it was at its higher point prior to the pandemic. So it’s a really, you could say we built it twice. And you’re going to see incredible numbers start coming in, if everything is sort of left alone. Be careful, very complex, be careful, but you’re going to see some incredible things happening. And remember us when you see these things happening, if you would. Remember us because I’m looking at elements of our economy that are set to be a rocket ship up. It’s a rocket ship up. We have the greatest country in the world. We have the greatest economy in the world. And as bad as the pandemic was, we were hit so hard just like the entire world was hit so hard. Places that thought they got away with it, didn’t get away with it. They’re suffering right now. We did something that is a really considered a medical miracle. They’re calling it a miracle. And that was the vaccine. We got the vaccine developed in nine months instead of nine years, or five years, or 10 years, or a long time. It was supposed to take a long time, many, many years to develop a vaccine. We have two out, we have another one coming almost immediately, and it really is a great achievement. So you should start to see really good numbers over the next few months. I think you’re going to see those numbers really skyrocket downward. And I can only say this. We have worked hard. We’ve left it all, as the athletes would say, we’ve left it all on the field. We don’t have to come and say… We’ll never say in a month, when we’re sitting in Florida, we’re not going to be looking at each other and saying, “You know, if we only worked a little bit harder.” You can’t work harder. And we had a lot of obstacles, and we went through the obstacles and we just got 75 million votes. And that’s a record in the history of sitting presidents. That’s an all time record by a lot, by many millions, in the history of sitting presidents. It’s been really just an honor. And one of the things we’re very, very proud of is the selection of almost 300 federal judges and three great Supreme Court justices. That’s a very big number. That’s a record setting number. And so we’ve done a lot, and there’s still things to do. The first thing we have to do is pay our respects and our love to the incredible people and families who’ve suffered so gravely from the China Virus. It’s a horrible thing that was put onto the world. We all know where it came from, but it’s a horrible, horrible thing. So be very careful, be very, very careful. But we want to pay a great love, great love to all of the people that have suffered, including families who have suffered so gravely. So with that, I just want to say you are amazing people. This is a great, great country. It is my greatest honor and privilege to have been your president. I will always fight for you. I will be watching. I will be listening. And I will tell you that the future of this country has never been better. I wish the new administration great luck and great success. I think they’ll have great success. They have the foundation to do something really spectacular. And again, we put it in a position like it’s never been before, despite the worst plague to hit, since I guess you’d say 1917, over a hundred years ago. And despite that, despite that, the things that we’ve done have been just incredible and I couldn’t have done it without you. So just a goodbye. We love you. We will be back in some form. And again, I want to just in leaving, I want to thank our Vice President, Mike Pence, and Karen. I want to thank Congress, because we really worked well with Congress, at least certain elements of Congress. But we really did. We’ve gotten so much done that nobody thought would be possible, but I do want to thank Congress. And I want to thank all of the great people of Washington, DC. All of the people that we worked with to put this miracle together. So have a good life. We will see you soon. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.

"8","02-28-21","Well, thank you very much. And hello, CPAC. Do you miss me yet? Do you miss me yet? A lot of things going on. There’s so many wonderful friends, conservatives and fellow citizens in this room and all across our country. I stand before you today to declare that the incredible journey we’ve begun together, we went through a journey like nobody else. There’s never been a journey like it. There’s never been a journey so successful. We began it together four years ago, and it is far from being over. We’ve just started. Our movement of proud, hardworking, and you know what? This is the hardest working people, hard working American Patriots is just getting started. And in the end we will win. We will win. We’ve been doing a lot of winning as we gather this week, we’re in the middle of a historic struggle for America’s future, America’s culture, and America’s institutions, borders, and most cherished principles. Our security, our prosperity, and our very identity as Americans is at stake, like perhaps at no other time. So no matter how much the Washington establishment and the powerful, special interests may want to silence us, let there be no doubt. We will be victorious. And America will be stronger and greater than ever before. I want to thank my great friends, Matt and Mercedes Schlep. Matt, thank you. Thank you. Mercedes, thank you very much. And the American Conservative Union for hosting this extraordinary event. They’re talking about it all over the world, Matt. I know you don’t like that, but that’s okay, all over the world. I also want to pay my love and respect to the great Rush Limbaugh who is watching closely and smiling down on us. He’s watching and he’s loving it and he loves Catherine. Catherine, thank you for being here, so great. Thank you Catherine. He loved you, Catherine. I will tell you that. Fantastic. Thank you Catherine very much. To each and every one of you here at CPAC, I am more grateful to you than you will ever know. We’re gathered this afternoon to talk about the future of our movement, the future of our party, and the future of our beloved country. For the next four years, the brave Republicans in this room will be at the heart of the effort to oppose the radical Democrats, the fake news media, and their toxic cancel culture. Something new to our ears, cancel culture. And I want you to know that I’m going to continue to fight right by your side. We will do what we’ve done right from the beginning, which is to win. We’re not starting new parties. They kept saying, he’s going to start a brand new party. We have the Republican party. It’s going to unite and be stronger than ever before. I am not starting a new party. That was fake news, fake news. No. Wouldn’t that be brilliant? Let’s start a new party and let’s divide our vote so that you can never win. No, we’re not interested in that. No we have tremendous, Mr. McLaughlin just gave me numbers that nobody’s ever heard of before, more popular than anybody. That’s all of us. It’s all of us. Those are great numbers. And I want to thank you very much. Those are incredible numbers. I came here and he was giving me 95%, 97%, 92%. I said, they’re great. And I want to thank everybody in this room and everybody all throughout the country, throughout the world, if you want to really know that. Thank you though. Thank you. We will be united and strong like never before. We will save and strengthen America. And we will fight the onslaught of radicalism, socialism, and indeed it all leads to communism once and for all. That’s what it leads to. You’ll be hearing more and more about that as we go along. But that’s what it leads to. You know that. We all knew that the Biden administration was going to be bad. But none of us even imagined just how bad they would be and how far left they would go. He never talked about this. We would have those wonderful debates. He would never talk about this. We didn’t know what the hell he was talking about actually. His campaign was all lies. Talked about energy, I thought I said, “This guy actually, he’s okay with energy.” He wasn’t okay with energy. He wants to put you all out of business. He’s not okay with energy. He wants windmills, the windmills. The windmills that don’t work when you need them. Joe Biden has had the most disastrous first month of any president in modern history. That’s true. Already the Biden administration has proven that they are anti jobs, anti-family, anti borders, anti energy, anti-women, and anti science. In just one short month, we have gone from America first to America last. You think about it, right? America last. There’s no better example than the new and horrible crisis on our Southern border. We did such a good job. It was all worked. Nobody’s ever seen anything that we did. And now he wants it all to go to hell. When I left office just six weeks ago, we had created the most secure border in us history. We had built almost 500 miles of a great border wall that helped us with these numbers because once it’s up, they used to say, “A wall doesn’t work.” Well, you know what I’ve always said, walls and wheels. Those are two things that will never change. The wall has been amazing. It’s been incredible and little sections of it to complete, They don’t want to complete it. They don’t want to complete little sections in certain little areas. They don’t want to complete. But it’s had an impact that nobody would have even believed. It’s amazing considering that the Democrats’ number one priority was to make sure that the wall would never, ever get built, would never, ever happen, would never get financed. We got it financed. We ended catch and release, ended asylum fraud, and brought illegal crossings to historic lows. When illegal aliens trespass across our borders, they were properly caught, detained and sent back home. And these were some rough customers. I want to tell you some rough customers were entering our country. It took them the new administration only a few weeks to turn this unprecedented accomplishment into self-inflicted humanitarian and national security disaster by recklessly eliminating our border, security measures, controls, all of the things that we put into place. Joe Biden has triggered a massive flood of illegal immigration into our country, the likes of which we have never seen before. They’re coming up by the tens of thousands. They’re all coming to take advantage of the things that he said that’s luring everybody to come to America. And we’re one country. We can’t afford the problems of the world, as much as we’d love to. We’d love to help. But we can’t do that. So they’re all coming because of promises and foolish words. Perhaps worst of all, Joe Biden’s decision to cancel border security has single-handedly launched a youth migrant crisis that is enriching child smugglers, vicious criminal cartels, and some of the most evil people on the planet. You see it every day, just turn on the news. You’ll see it every day. Under my administration, we stopped the child smugglers. We dismantle the criminal cartels. We greatly limited drug and human trafficking to a level that nobody actually thought was possible. And the wall helped us a lot. And we protected vulnerable people from the ravages of dangerous predators. And that’s what they are dangerous, dangerous predators. But the Biden administration has put the vial coyotes back in business and it has done so in a very, very big way. Under the new administration, catch and release has been restored. Can you imagine? We work so hard, catch, you know where that is? You catch them, you take their name, they may be killers. They may be rapists. They may be drug smugglers. You take their name and you release them into our country. We did the opposite. We not only didn’t release them, we had them brought back to their country. Illegal immigrants are now being apprehended and released along the entire Southern border, just the opposite of what it was two months ago. They weren’t coming because they couldn’t get in. Once they think they can get in, they’re coming. And they are coming at levels that you haven’t even seen yet, by the hundreds of thousands, by the millions they’ll be coming. The Biden administration is now actively expediting the admission of illegal migrants, enabling them to lodge frivolous asylum claims and admitting them by the thousands and thousands and thousands a day, crowded together in unsanitary conditions, despite the ongoing economic and public health crisis, COVID-19, or as I call it, the China virus. There’s no masks. There’s no double mask. That was a new one that came out two weeks ago. First Fauci said, “You don’t need masks, no masks, no good. No, no.” Then all of a sudden, you want them; and now he wants double masks. No social distancing, no nothing, no nothing. And together, and it’s sad actually. And it’s sad for them. And it sad for our country, what the Biden administration is doing to push young migrants into the hands of human traffickers and coyotes is dangerous, immoral, and indefensible, hard to believe it’s happening. Biden has failed in his number one duty as chief executive enforcing America’s laws. This alone should be reason enough for Democrats to suffer withering losses in the midterms and to lose the White House decisively four years from now. Actually, as you know, they just lost the White House. But it’s one of those things. But who knows, who knows? I may even decide to beat them for a third time. Okay? For a third time. True. Joe Biden defunded the border wall and stopped all future construction, even on small open sections that just needed to be finished up routine little work, it’s already been bought. Wait until the contractors get to them. And they say, “No, it costs us much more money not to finish this small section than if we finished it.” That’s going to be nice. Wait until you see those bills start pouring in. He revoked the executive order cracking down on deadly sanctuary cities. He has effectively ordered a shutdown of ICE, halting virtually all deportations, everyone, murderers, everybody, no more. Let’s not deport people and restricting our law enforcement professionals. And they are great professionals. You have many of them represented here today, from conducting almost any immigration enforcement of any kind. The Biden policy of releasing criminals into the US interior is making America into a sanctuary nation where criminals, illegal immigrants, including gang members and sex offenders are set free into American communities. They have no idea who’s coming up. And remember with the caravans, these countries, not only the three of them, but many, many countries all over the world. They’re not giving us their best and their finest, because they’re intelligent. They’re not giving us their best and their finest. Remember I said that. I said that a long time ago, when I made the first remarks, when I came down the escalator with our great future first lady who says, hello, who loves you as much as I love you. But I said that a long time ago. And we turned out to be 100% correct. Biden’s radical immigration policies aren’t just illegal. They’re immoral. They’re heartless. And they are a betrayal of our nation’s core values. It’s a terrible thing that’s happening. The Republican party must hold Joe Biden and the Democrats accountable. They ripped up the diplomatic agreements we negotiated with Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to shut down illegal immigration. They got a fortune, they got paid $500 million a year. When I came into office, those countries were refusing to take back illegal alien gang members, including MS 13, the most vicious probably of them all. No matter where you go in the world, MS 13, they do things that even the worst don’t think about. So I asked how much do we pay these countries? How much do we pay them? Sir, we pay them approximately $ 500 million a year. It’s a lot of money. I mean, it’s peanuts compared to the way other countries rip us off, but that’s a lot of money. I said, “Okay, we aren’t going to pay them anymore because they wouldn’t take back the criminals.” And this was true with the Obama administration. It was true for many, many years. So we’d catch a murderer. We’d want to bring them back to Guatemala, or Honduras, or El Salvador. They wouldn’t take them back. “No, we don’t want them.” We’d fly them in. They wouldn’t let the plane land. We’d bus them in. They wouldn’t let the buses get anywhere near the border. And I said, “We’re not going to pay them anymore.” So after I said that, and I stopped payment, like a term that we use in the world of business, let’s stop payment. So we stopped payment. They were delinquent. We stopped payment and they very quickly came to the table and we made a deal, very quick deal. We still kept the money. We still didn’t pay because… Or we made a deal. And when illegal aliens came across our border, they were rapidly deported and lovingly accepted by those countries from where they came. And it worked out great. So now they accept the people and that we ultimately got along very well with those countries, those three countries and many countries throughout the world, because they respected us again. They didn’t respect us. They couldn’t believe what they were getting away with. But now, Joe Biden has wrecked this great deal, wrecked it. And they’re already doing what they were doing before and they’re taking the money. And that’s just a small portion of what’s going on. To top it all off, the Biden people are pushing a bill that would grant mass amnesty for millions of illegal aliens while massively expanding chain migration. That’s where you come in and everybody comes in, your grandmother, your father, your mother, your brother, your cousins. They come in so easily. So, so crazy. So crazy. It even requires that the US government provide a legal border crosses with taxable funded lawyers, lawyers, everybody need a good lawyer? You can’t have one. They get the lawyers, they get lawyers. They’re probably very good too. The Democrat immigration bill is a globalist corp. You take a look at the corporatist, big tech attack on hardworking citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed. And Republicans must ensure that it never is allowed to become federal law, which is what they want to do. We must stand tall in the party. We have to do this. We have to stand tall as the party for law abiding Americans and others, when they’re in our country. Border security is just one of the many issues on which the new administration has already betrayed the American people. He didn’t talk about this stuff. I debated him. He wasn’t talking about this. What he signed with those executive orders, they weren’t things that were discussed. We didn’t know all about him and the press because they’re fake news. They’re the fakest fakers there are. The press refused to ask the questions. And when I asked the questions on television, on the debate, Chris Wallace, in this case, and others refused to let him answer. They refused to let them answer the questions. Maybe we could have found something. Or if the media did its job, which they don’t, they’re callous indifference to working family is equally clear when it comes to the critical matter of getting America’s children back to school. And they must get back and get back right now, right now, crazy. Terrible. Terrible. The Biden administration is actually bragging about the classroom education they are providing to migrant children on the border. While at the same time, millions of American children are having their futures destroyed by Joe Biden’s anti-science school closures. Think of it. We’re educating students on the border, but our own people, children of our citizens, citizens themselves are not getting the education that they deserve. There’s no reason whatsoever why the vast majority of young Americans should not be back in school immediately. The only reason that most parents do not have that choice is because Joe Biden has sold out America’s children to the teacher’s unions. His position is morally inexcusable. You know that. Joe Biden has shamefully betrayed America’s youth. And he is cruelly keeping our children locked in their homes, no reason for it whatsoever. They want to get out. They’re cheating the next generations of Americans out of the future that they deserve. And they do deserve this future. They’re going to grow up and they’re going to have a scar. It’s a scandal of the highest order. And one of the most graven acts by any president in our lifetimes. It’s the teacher’s union, it’s the votes and it shouldn’t happen. And nobody has more respect for teachers than I do. And I’ll bet you, a lot of the people within that union, they agree with everything I’m saying. Even the New York Times is calling out the Democrats. The mental and physical health of these young people is reaching a breaking point. Tragically, suicide attempts have skyrocketed and student depression is now commonplace and at levels that we’ve never seen before. The Democrats now say we have to pass their $1.9 trillion boondoggle to open schools, but a very small part of it has to do with that. You know where it’s going, it’s going-Well, part of it has to do with that, you know where it’s going, it’s going to bail out badly run Democrats, that is so much of it. But billions of dollars for schools remain unspent from the COVID relief bills that were passed last year. So on behalf of the moms, dads, and children of America, I call on Joe Biden to get the schools open and get them open now. They’re a great thing to do. When I left office and we’re very proud of this because this was something that they said could not be done. The FDA said it, everybody said it. Any article you read said it couldn’t be done. It would be years and years, I handed the new administration what everyone is now calling a modern day medical miracle. Some say, it’s the greatest thing to happen in hundreds of years, two vaccines produced in record time with numerous others on the way, including the Johnson and Johnson vaccine that was approved just yesterday. And therapeutic relief also, if you’re sick, we have things now that are incredible. What has taken place over the last year under our administration would have taken any other precedent at least five years. And we got it done in nine months. Everyone says five years, oh, five years. Can you imagine if you had to go through what all of the countries of the world who are now getting the vaccine or soon will be getting it from various companies, but can you imagine if all of those countries had to go through what they’ve been going through over the last year? You’d lose hundreds of millions of people. I pushed the FDA like they have never been pushed before. They told me that loud and clear. They have never been pushed like I pushed them. I didn’t like them at all, but once we got it done, I said, I now love you very much. What the Trump administration has done with vaccines has in many respects, perhaps saved large portions of the world. Not only our country, but large portions of the world. Not only did we push the FDA far beyond what the bureaucrats wanted to do. We also put up billions and billions of dollars, 10 billion to produce the vaccines before we knew they were going to work. It was called a calculated bet or a calculated risk. We took a risk because if we didn’t do that, you still wouldn’t have the vaccines. You wouldn’t have them for a long time. So think of that, we took this bet. We made a bet because we thought we were on a certain track, but you’d be starting to make them right now. It’d be a long time before you ever saw. It takes 60 to 100 days to manufacture and inspect new doses. And that means that 100% of the increased availability that we have now was initiated by our administration. 100%. In fact, the director of National Institutes of Health, Francis Collins, he’s Fauci’s boss, actually, I think he’s a Democrat too, by the way, recently said that our operation warp speed was absolutely breathtaking and that the Trump administration deserves full credit, which we do. And as conservatives and Republicans, never forget that we did it. Never let them take the credit because they don’t deserve the credit. They just followed now, they’re following our plan, but this has been something that they really call, they call it an absolute miracle. Joe Biden is only implementing the plan that we put in place. And if we had an honest media, which we don’t, they would say it loud and clear. By the time I left that magnificent house at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, almost 20 million Americans had already been vaccinated. 1.5 million doses were administered on my final day alone. 1.5 million in a day. Yet Biden said just a few days ago that when he got here, meaning The White House, there was no vaccine. He said, there’s no vaccine. Oh, good. Say it again, Joe. Now I don’t think he said that, frankly, in a malicious way. I really don’t. I actually believe he said that because he didn’t really know what the hell was happening. Never let them forget. This was us. We did this. And the distribution is moving along, according to our plan. And it’s moving along really well. We had the military, what they’ve done, our generals and all of the people, what they’ve done is incredible. But remember, we took care of a lot of people, including, I guess on December 21st, we took care of Joe Biden. Cause he got his shot. He got his vaccine. He forgot. It shows you how un-painful all that vaccine shot is. So everybody go get your shot. He forgot so it wasn’t very traumatic obviously, but he got his shot and it’s good that he got his shot. Last year, I predicted to you that the extremism, corruption and incompetence of the Biden administration would be literally unprecedented in American history. Unfortunately he has proven me 100% right. Already as president, Biden has urged Congress to pass legislation shredding your Second Amendment. Your Second Amendment is in far bigger trouble than you now, and for four years I fought like hell to save your Second Amendment. And we saved it 100%. We saved it. He signed an order to conduct politically correct far left indoctrination trainings in every department of the federal government, including the US military after I had terminated these horrible things that were being preached to our military and he wants it to go forward. It’s insane within his first few hours Biden eliminated our national security travel bands on nations plagued by terrorism. His first priority was to open our borders to un-vetted travelers from Libya, Yemen, Syria, Somalia, and many other countries where strict vetting cannot occur. Countries that have tremendous problems. Countries with tremendous terrorism problems. We did it a travel ban. It was a real achievement. We told those countries, sorry, straighten out your act. We don’t want people coming in where they had an ideology or a problem. We just couldn’t have it. And it was incredible, how it worked was incredible. And he terminated it. We had to get it approved. It went all the way up to the Supreme Court of the United States. We got it approved and he terminates it. In addition, he’s already increased refugee admissions by nearly 10 times, but in effect, it’ll soon be hundreds of times as millions of people flow up through our soon to be open borders. And by the way, the border patrol and ICE, these are some of the great heroes of our country. These are incredible people. I got to know them very well. Your families still cannot go out to eat at local restaurants. But Joe Biden is bringing in thousands upon thousands of refugees from all over the world. People that nobody knows anything about, we don’t have crime records. We don’t have health records. What are they bringing in with them? When I left office, we had virtually ended the endless wars, these endless wars, they go on forever. They go on forever. I would go to Dover and I would see caskets, coffins coming in. I’d see the parents and the wives and husbands. I would see the kids. Endless wars, 19 years in Afghanistan. We have it down to almost nothing left and I hear they might want to go back in. Iraq, remember I used to say, don’t go in, but if you’re going to go in, keep the oil, well, we went in and we didn’t keep the oil. We had made historic peace deals in the middle East. Like nobody thought were even possible with not a drop of bloodshed. And by the way, not one American soldier has been killed in Afghanistan in over a year. Think of that. Not one. Those troops have largely come home. At the same time, the new administration unilaterally withdrew our crippling sanctions on Iran, foolishly giving away all of America’s leveraged before negotiations have even begun. Leave the sanctions negotiated. Does anybody understand what I’m saying here? Are there any good business people? You don’t have to be a good, are there any bad business people? They took off the sanctions. They took off the sanctions. They say, well, we’re going to not have any sanctions. Let’s negotiate a deal. I don’t know, Matt Schlep. I don’t think you would have done that, do you think so, Matt? I don’t think so. Mercedes wouldn’t have. Now you do that, you make a deal and then you do what they want it. I will tell you something and I said it, had we had a fair election, the results would have been much different and we would have had a deal with Iran within the first week. They wanted those sanctions off. He took them off for nothing, for nothing. Now you watch how tough they negotiate. In another horrendous surrender he agreed to get back into the World Health Organization. For approximately $500 million a year, which is what we were paying. When I withdrew from the WHO and you know the whole story with that, they called it badly. They really are puppets for China. They called and they wanted us to stay in. I said, how much are we paying approximately $500 million? How much is China paying a much larger in terms of population country, sir, they’re paying $39 million. I say, why are we paying 500 million and they’re paying 39? I could tell you why. Because the people that made the deal are stupid, that’s why. And I had no idea how popular it was. I didn’t even know if I would be able to politically, because people were so happy when I did get out, but I said, so if we went in, we could get it for 39 million, which is what China, not 500 million, which is what we were stupidly paying. And they said, we can make a deal, we want you to go in, we can make a deal. Okay, and I decided not to do it, but we could have had it for 39. We could have had it for the same as China. And they decide now to go back into the World Health Organization and pay 500 million, what the hell is wrong with them? No, no, this is just emblematic. It’s a tremendous amount of money, but compared to trillions, it’s not, but it’s a tremendous amount of money. Why would China pay 39 million? And we’re paying almost 500 million. Why? So we could have made the same deal that China had 39 million. And they just say, we’re going back in. We’re going back into the World Health Organization. They go back in, they pay 500. It is so sad, just like the Iran and the World Health Organization, Joe Biden put the United States back into the very unfair and very costly Paris Climate Accord without negotiating a better deal. They wanted us so badly back in. I’ll tell you they wanted us. I was getting called from all of the countries. You must come back into the Paris Accord. I said, tell me why, give me one good reason. First of all, China doesn’t kick in for 10 years, Russia goes by an old standard, which was not a clean standard and other countries, but we get hit right from the beginning would have cost us hundreds of thousands and millions of jobs. It was a disaster, but they go back in, I could have made an unbelievable deal and gone back in, but I didn’t want to do that. Surrendering millions of jobs and trillions of dollars to all of these other countries, almost all of them that were in the deal. So they have favorable treatment, we don’t have favorable treatment. And we just said, we’re going back in. To go back in, they wanted us so badly, you could’ve negotiated, if you wanted to go back in which frankly, we have the cleanest air, the cleanest water and everything else that we’ve ever had. So I don’t know why we have to. What good does it do when we’re clean, but China is not and Russia is not an India is not. So they are pouring fumes, you know the world is actually a small piece of the universe, right? They’re pouring fumes and we’re trying to protect everything and building products for three times more than is necessary. No, they could have made a great deal. If they were going to go back in, that’s fine. But they could have made a great deal and said, instead of just saying we’re back in. These people. And in one of his first official acts, which was incredible, because again, he talked about energy. He never said he was going to do this. He canceled the Keystone XL Pipeline destroying not the 8,000 or the 9,000 or the 11,000 jobs that you hear. But 42,000 great paying jobs on just about day one, right? He never talked about that during a debate because he wouldn’t have gotten away with it. Well, he would have, because they cheated so much, it probably wouldn’t have been. No, but that was not a topic of conversation. Remember fracking, you can frack. Oh, we love fracking. During the primary no fracking. As soon as he got through that, he said, no, of course everybody can frack. No fracking. You wait till you see what happens with your gasoline. Wait till you see what happens and we cannot let this stuff continue to go on. One of my proudest accomplishments as president was to make America energy independent, the United States became the number one energy superpower on Earth. Number one. Became number one. Bigger than Saudi Arabia, bigger than Russia by a lot. We left them all in the dust. They were all in the dust. But if the Democrats have their way, we are heading from energy dominance to energy disaster. That’s what’s happening. You have to see what’s going on. Everything’s being closed up. It’s a disaster. The blackouts we saw in California last summer and all the time and the windmill calamity that we’re witnessing in Texas. Great state of Texas. We love Texas, but it’s so sad when you look at it, that’ll just be the start. How bad is wind power. So I talk about it all the time at CPAC, right? We went to CPAC. Remember last I said, we’re going to watch the president, well, Alice, the wind isn’t blowing. I don’t believe we’ll have any electricity. I remember we would kid, but I wasn’t actually kidding. It’s such an expensive form of energy. It’s so bad for the environment. It kills the birds. It destroys the landscapes. And remember, these are structural columns with fans on them. They wear out, and when they wear out all over the country, you see them, nobody takes them down. They’re rotting. They’re rusting, how this is environmentally good for our country. And it costs many, many times more than natural gas, which is clean and can fuel our great factories. Wind can’t do that. And solar, I love solar, but it doesn’t have the capacity to do what we have to do to make America great again, sorry it just doesn’t have it. Under the radical Democrat policies, the price of gasoline has already surged 30% since the election. And we’ll go to $5, $6, $7 and even higher. So enjoy that when you go to the pump and they’ll say that’d be about $200 to fill up your van. Remember they used to go to the little small vans. They got away from the big ones that everybody wanted. They went to the small ones. Well, you know what? Probably a good investment. As long as these guys have their say because you know, it’s a shame what’s happening. Energy prices are going to go through the roof. And that includes your electric bills. That includes any bill having to do with energy, our biggest cost. We will now be relying on Russia and the middle East for oil. And they talk about Russia, Russia, Russia. What’s better than what this guy has done for Russia. I had oil where they were actually paying you to take it. Okay. Remember they were going to give you 37 a barrel, but you had to take it away. You had free oil almost for a period of time and one way I was proud of it, but we also had to save the energy industry and it worked out well. And I dealt with Russia and Saudi Arabia and they cut back on production and we got it back up. But now it’s going the opposite because now they are taking this incredible energy independence away from the people of our country. And you’re going to see costs go like you have never seen them go before. It’s a very sad and very stupid thing that they’re doing. The Biden policies are a massive win for other oil producing countries and a massive loss for the United States and our great citizens, Joe Biden and the Democrats are even pushing policies that would destroy women’s sports. A lot of new records are being broken in women’s sports. Hate to say that ladies, but got a lot of new records, they’re being shattered. For years, the weightlifting, every ounce is like a big deal for many years. All of a sudden somebody comes along and beats it by a hundred pounds. Boom. Now young girls and women are in sets that they are now being forced to compete against those who are biological males. It’s not good for women. It’s not good for women’s sports, which worked so long and so hard to get to where they are. The records that stood for years, even decades are now being smashed with these. Smashed. If this is not change women’s sports, as we know it will die. They’ll end, it’ll end. What coach, if I’m a coach, I want to be a great coach. What coach, as an example, wants to recruit a young woman to compete, if her record can easily be broken by somebody who was born a man. Not too many of those coaches around, right? If they are around, they won’t be around long because they’re going to have a big problem when that record is we’re oh and 16, but we’re getting better. No I think it’s crazy. I think it’s just crazy what’s happening. We must protect the integrity of women’s sports so important after. And I don’t even know, is that controversial? Somebody said, well, that’s going to be very controversial. I said, that’s okay. You haven’t heard anything yet. As you can see, the early weeks of the Biden administration have nothing less than, they’ve been a catastrophe for American workers and for American families, the task of our mission. And for us, it’s our movement. As I said, a movement like has never been seen, I think we could probably say, never been seen anywhere in the world. And nobody’s ever seen a movement like this. I’d grow up and I’d watch somebody who came in second in New Hampshire or first in Iowa and that was the end. And they became famous for the rest of their lives. We won the election twice. I mean, think about it, twice. The task for our movement and our party is to stand up to this destructive agenda with confidence and with result, the future of the Republican party is as a party that defends the social economic and cultural interests and values of working American families of every race, color, and creed. That’s why the party is growing so rapidly and is becoming a different party. And it’s becoming a party of love. You have to see outside the streets. I mean, there’s such love. The flags. Amazing. That’s right now, it’s a party that’s incredible. The people, the spirit, and there are, as you probably heard a little while ago, I mean, there’s more spirit now than there’s ever been, including even before the election, more spirit now than we’ve ever seen, because people are seeing how bad it can be. And again, I want to thank Rush and Catherine, because what he did to get the word out has been incredible. Some people are irreplaceable as Sean Hannity would say and he said Rush is irreplaceable, but his spirit lives on. And that’s something that we need and we love. Republicans believe that the needs of every citizen must come first. In fact, America must come first. We don’t put it first. America must come first. We don’t put it first. They don’t put it first. Over the past four years my administration delivered for Americans of all backgrounds like never before, like never before. We built the strongest economy in the history of the world, raised wages and achieved the lowest African-American, Hispanic-American, Asian-American unemployment rates ever, ever, ever recorded. It was so great for everybody of all backgrounds that even after the China virus, we are leading the world. Nobody’s even close. We’re leading it in the comeback. Our economic comeback has been incredible. That’s because the financial and economic foundation we built was so strong, that unlike other countries who are having a hard time, we didn’t break. We came roaring back, and now our stock market and your 401(k)s are again at record levels, higher than ever before, actually. Many people have asked, “What is Trumpism?” A new term being used more and more. I’m hearing that term more and more. I didn’t come up with it. But what it means is great deals, great trade deals. Great ones, not deals where we give away everything, our jobs, our money, like the USMCA replacement of the horrible NAFTA. NAFTA was one of the worst deals ever made, probably the worst trade deal ever made, and we ended it. A lot of people forget, we ended it. Now we have the USMCA-Mexico-Canada. It’s incredible what it’s done for our farmers, who are doing fantastically. Did you see grain prices and grain sales are at an all-time high? Wheat, all-time high. So many elements of farms and farmers, and they love me. Remember, it’s going to be very close in Iowa. Well, it wasn’t close. We won in a landslide, Iowa, because our farmers know, and they put up with it, and we did a lot of work with the tariffs and all these things that we had to do to get it. Now the farmers are doing great, but they’re setting records. It means low taxes and eliminating job-killing regulations, Trumpism. It means strong borders, but people coming into our country based on a system of merit. They come in and they can help us, as opposed to coming here and not being good for us, including criminals, of which there are many. It means no riots in the streets. It means law enforcement. It means very strong protection for the Second Amendment and the right to keep and bear arms. It means support for the forgotten men and women who have been taken advantage of for so many years. They were doing great. They were doing great before that horrible thing from China came in and hit us, and now they’re starting to do really well again. If you think about it, we built the economy twice. We built it then, and then like every other country in the world, it went down, and then we built it again. Now it’s higher in many ways, certainly in the stock market, it’s higher in many ways than it was before. That’s because of the foundation, and no country comes even close to competing with our comeback. It means a strong military and taking care of our vets, but a strong military, which we have totally rebuilt. We have rebuilt it. Our military has never been stronger than it is today. It was tired. It was depleted. It was obsolete. Now we have the best brand-new equipment ever made, and it was all produced right here in the USA. Isn’t that nice? We take care of our vets. We had a poll recently just before leaving office. The vets had a 91% approval rating for the way we took care of them. That’s the highest number in the history of the polls, the vet polls. On top of all of that, we have even created the Space Force, the first new branch of the United States military in nearly 75 years. The mission of the Democrat party is to promote socialism. They want to promote socialism, ultimately leading, unfortunately, to communism, and that will happen. If you look at Venezuela, you look at some of these countries, that’s why some of our biggest supporters are from South America, Latin America, because they’ve seen what goes on with all of this cancel culture, and you can’t speak, and let’s cut them off and let’s not give them words. The mission of our movement and of the Republican party must be to create a future of good jobs, strong families, safe communities, a vibrant culture, and a great nation for all Americans, and that’s what we’re creating. Their party is based upon unvarnished disdain for America, its past and its people. You see that happening. It’s horrible the way they treat the legacy of our country, the culture of our country. Our party is based on love for America and the belief that this is an exceptional nation, blessed by God. We take great pride in our country. We teach the truth about history. We celebrate our rich heritage and national traditions. We honor George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson, and all national heroes, and of course, we respect our great American flag. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much, so nice. I started that hearing… Really, we’re getting word of that, hearing that during some of the rallies, especially the latter rallies, where we set records. We had 56 unbelievable packed rallies, and nobody’s ever had anything like we had. We started hearing, “We love you.” I asked somebody, because we really liked Ronald Reagan. He was a great President. We had others, but I said, “Did anybody ever say that to Ronald Reagan or to any of our great…” and to the best of all of these political professionals’ knowledge and pollsters’, nobody’s ever heard that chant before, Matt, so it’s an honor. Believe me, it’s an honor. It’s a great honor. It’s a great honor. When you think about, we love you, you say that about, I hate to say it, am I a politician? I don’t know. Maybe I’m a politician. I hate to admit it, but that’s really… It’s an honor that you would say it. We believe in patriotic education and strongly oppose the radical indoctrination of America’s youth. It’s horrible. We are committed to defending innocent life and to upholding the Judeo-Christian values of our founders and of our founding. We embrace free thought. We stand up to political correctives, and we reject left-wing lunacy, and in particular, we reject cancel culture. We know that the rule of law is the ultimate safeguard. We affirm that the Constitution means exactly what it says, as written, as written. They want to change it. They want to change it. They want to get rid of it, frankly. We believe in law and order. We believe that the men and women of law enforcement are heroes who truly deserve our absolute support. We don’t defund the police. We are not defunding the police. We believe in standing up to China, shutting down, outsourcing, bringing back our factories and supply chains and ensuring that America, not China, dominates the future of the world. That’s what’s going to happen. By the way, we took in hundreds of billions of dollars from China during my administration, hundreds. They never gave us 25 cents. It was a one-way street. We took in hundreds of billions. During negotiations, they would say, “Look, the one thing, we don’t want any more of these tariffs, these tariffs.” Those tariffs, we took in so much money, and what happened is, they became competitive. What happened with people, they wouldn’t go to China. They’d build a lot of it back in our country. They would make it here instead. In addition to that, we were taking in billions and billions and billions of dollars from China. But in all fairness to China, we made a trade deal with them. This was prior to COVID. Once COVID happened, I no longer cared so much about the trade deal, because what happened with that was just disgraceful. But that’s one of the things, that’s one of the reasons that right now our farmers are doing so good. I used to tell China, “Look, look, go and get a lot of wheat. Get a lot of different things, all of the things we just talked about, you better go out and do it, because this country has not been treated fairly by you for many, many years, many, many years.” We used to lose $504 billion trade deficit with China, 504, not million. $504 million is a lot, right? You know that through the World Health Organization. Now take 504 million and make it $504 billion, we had deficits with China. It was absolutely insane that this could keep going. It’s amazing that you still have a country left. The people that did this to our country, they should be ashamed of themselves. They should be ashamed of themselves. Companies that leave America to create jobs in China and other countries that have ripped us off for years should not be rewarded. They should be tariffed, fined and punished. They should not be rewarded. That’s what the Biden administration is doing. But of course, as you know, they have a very close, personal relationship with China, so I don’t expect much to happen. It’s a shame, because it really is a threat. It’s a tremendous economic threat. Thank God we’ve rebuilt our military, but it’s a tremendous economic threat. Never forget it. These are the convictions that define our movement today and must define the Republican party in the years ahead. Very simple, it’s really quite simple, isn’t it? Another one of the most urgent issues facing the Republican party is that of ensuring fair, honest and secure elections. Such a disgrace, such a disgrace, such a disgrace. We must pass comprehensive election reforms, and we must do it now. The Democrats used the China virus as an excuse to change all of the election rules without the approval of their state legislatures, making it therefore illegal and had a massive impact on the election. Again, you have to go to the legislatures to get these approvals. This alone would have easily changed the outcome of the election at levels that you wouldn’t have even believed. Even with COVID, even with all of the things, the numbers are staggering. We can never let this or other abuses of the 2020 election be repeated or happen again, can never let that happen again. You see what’s going on. We’ve been set back so greatly with other countries and with the world. We need election integrity and election reform immediately. Republicans should be the party of honest elections that can give everyone confidence in the future of our country. Without honest elections, who has confidence? Who has confidence? This issue is being studied and examined. But the reality is you cannot have a situation where ballots are indiscriminately pouring in from all over the country, tens of millions of ballots. Where are they coming from? They’re coming all over the place, where illegal aliens and dead people are voting, and many other horrible things are happening that are too voluminous to even mention, but people know. I mean, it’s being studied, and the level of dishonesty is not to be believed. We have a very sick and corrupt electoral process that must be fixed immediately. This election was rigged, and the Supreme Court and other courts didn’t want to do anything about it. We did. If you just take that one element where they didn’t go through legislatures, it’s illegal. You can’t do it. It’s in the Constitution. They didn’t have the courage, the Supreme Court. They didn’t have the courage to act, but instead, used process and lack of standing. I was told the President of the United States has no standing. It’s my election. It’s your election. We have no standing. If you’re think of it, we had almost 20 states go into the Supreme Court so that we didn’t have a standing problem. They rejected it. They rejected it. They should be ashamed of themselves for what they’ve done to our country. They didn’t have the guts or the courage to make the right decision. They didn’t want to talk about it. You had the case led by the great State of Texas. 18 states went in, “You don’t have standing. Oh, let’s not talk about it.” They didn’t have the guts to do what should be done, and that’s on top of all of the other forms of cheating. But this is the most basic of all, they would have local courts and local politicians change the rules, in some cases, a day or two before the election. This should never be allowed to happen to another presidential candidate or presidential race, should never be allowed to happen. Today I want to outline the steps that we must take to have an election system in this country that is honest, fair and accurate. We need one election day, not 45, 30, one day like it’s been. The Republicans don’t get this and the other things I’m going to say, that you should, like the Supreme Court, be ashamed of yourselves. One day, one day, and the only people that should be allowed to vote by mail are people that can be proven to be either very sick, or out of the country, or military where they can’t do it. One day. They have millions and millions of ballots sitting around all over the place for long periods of time. Gee, I wonder what happens with those ballots? I wonder what happens? It’s common sense. It’s a disgrace. It’s an absolute disgrace. There should be a legitimate reason for someone to vote absentee, has to have a reason. We should eliminate the insanity of mass and very corrupt mail-in voting. We must have voter ID, voter ID. To get into the Democrat National Convention, when they had the convention, you needed voter ID. You needed an ID card. You couldn’t get in unless you had an ID. So many people told me you can’t get in that place. You need ID. Nobody had ID. You need voter ID. They know that. There’s a con job. They’re conning everybody. They know that. They know the wall was good. They knew the wall would work, but they didn’t want to have it, because we wanted it. I made one big mistake in the wall. I should have said, “We will not have a wall.” Then they would have said, “Let’s build a wall.” I made a big mistake. I made a big mistake. I’m sorry. It took us a year and a half extra. Because of that mistake, we will not have a wall. “We need a wall immediately,” said Chuck Schumer. We need universal signature matching. They want to pass a bill where you don’t have to match signatures, where signatures don’t mean anything. Now they know it, just like with the wall, just like with voter ID, when you need to go into anything that’s Democrat run, you need it. But for voting, which is our most sacred institution, you don’t. They don’t want to let you have it. There should be a 100% requirement to verify the citizenship of every person who votes, and there must be a chain of custody protections for every ballot, every ballot. You saw what happened in Detroit and Philadelphia and many other places, swing states mostly, all over, but swing states mostly. You saw what happened? You saw what was going on. You saw that more people… You take a look at the votes. When you have more votes than you have people, that’s a problem, right? Is that a problem? We have a little problem adjusting in Detroit. We seem to have more votes than we have people, a lot more votes, an election-changing number. We’re not talking about a number where you catch… No, these are election-changing numbers. In Pennsylvania, they had hundreds of thousands of more votes than they had people voting. What’s that all about? What’s that all about? Cheating, they say. Yeah, I’d say so. In the history of our country, and it has taken place for years in Pennsylvania, in Detroit and various other places, but there’s tremendous, never like this, because they used COVID as a way of cheating. That’s what happened, and everybody knows it. Hundreds of thousands and millions of ballots, they used it as a way of getting what they’ve wanted for many years, and the Republicans have to do something about it. They’d better do something about it. Our election process is worse than that, in many cases, of a third-world country. You know that. You saw what was going on. Even if you consider nothing else, it is undeniable that election rules were illegally changed at the last minute in almost every swing state, with the procedures rewritten by local politicians… you’re not allowed to do that… and local judges. They want more time. They want this. They want that. All done by local politicians or local judges, as opposed to state legislatures as required by the Constitution of the United States. These are numbers that are massive. These aren’t little numbers. These are numbers that in each state is a transformative number. It changes the outcome of the election, and it’s not close. Regardless of your political views, this should concern you as a constitutional matter. The Supreme court, again, didn’t have the guts or the courage to do anything about it, and neither did other judges. Democrats even admitted in Time Magazine, which is I would say on the liberal side, that they couldn’t… They couldn’t hold it in. They had to brag about it, because what they did, they had a brag about it. They couldn’t do it. You got to read this story. It’s a disaster. It’s a disaster for our country that we can allow something so corrupt to happen. Read that article. I really encourage you. You read that article. Yet all of the election integrity measures in the world will mean nothing if we don’t have free speech. That’s where we’re at now. If Republicans can be censored for speaking the truth and calling out corruption, we will not have democracy, and we will have only left-wing tyranny. We can do this. We can do this. We’re smarter than they are. We’re tougher than they are. For some reason, we just don’t. We don’t get it done. We let them attack our businesses, and we don’t attack their businesses. I believe your numbers are bigger than their numbers, but you’re nicer than they are. You’re not as vicious as they are. In the past, we would debate. I would have it. I’d debate. You’ve seen me for many years. They’d throw something. I debate. They debate. Who knows who wins. People go. They vote. They see what happens, but they would have an idea. They would disagree. The public would hear it. The debate and discourse would take place, and then somebody would make a decision. You would win. You would lose. The public would make up its mind. But now there is no debate, because they refuse to allow our side to even speak or be heard. There is no debate because they refuse to allow our side to even speak or be heard. They don’t want debate, because we have easy victories in a debate, very easy victories. It’s is called common sense. It’s called other things, but it’s called common sense. So they don’t want a debate. The time has come to break up big tech monopolies and restore fair competition. Republicans, conservatives must open up our platforms and repeal section 230 liability protections. And if the federal government refuses to act, then every state in the union where we have the votes, which is a lot of them, big tech giants, like Twitter, Google, and Facebook should be punished with major sanctions whenever they silence conservative voices. And governor Ron DeSantis of Florida and in Texas and in other States are doing this. If they do what they’re doing, Florida, and that legislation will pass. And Texas and others will have tremendous power to do what’s right and what’s fair. We have no time to waste, Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats in Congress are racing to pass a flagrantly unconstitutional attack on the first amendment and the integrity of our elections known as HR 1. Do you know what HR 1 is? It’s a disaster. Their bill would drastically restrict political speech, empower power the federal government to shut down decent. And turn the Federal Election Commission into a partisan political weapon. In addition, it virtually eliminates voter ID requirements nationwide, effectively ends all registration deadlines. Can you believe this? Requires States to give ballots to felons, automatically registers every welfare recipient to vote, and puts unaccountable unelected bureaucrats in charge of drawing congressional districts. That’s going to be a lot of fun. This monster must be stopped. It cannot be allowed to pass. Now more than ever is the time for tough strong and energetic Republican leaders who have spines of steel. We need strong leadership. We cannot have leaders who show more passion for condemning their fellow Americans than they have ever shown for standing up to Democrats, the media, and the radicals who want to turn America into a socialist country. Instead of attacking me and more importantly the voters of our movement, top establishment Republicans in Washington should be spending their energy in opposing Biden, Pelosi, Schumer, and the Democrats. I’ve said to some of them, I said, “You know, during the Obama years, and now during Biden, if you spent the same energy on attacking them, you’d actually be successful as you do on attacking me, in many cases.” The Democrats don’t have grandstanders like Mitt Romney, little Ben Sasse, Richard Burr, Bill Cassidy, Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Pat Toomey, and in the house, Tom Rice, South Carolina, Adam Kinzinger, Dan Newhouse, Anthony Gonzalez. That’s another beauty. Fred Upton, Jaime Herrera Beutler, Peter Meyer, John Katko, David Valadao. And of course the warmonger, a person that loves seeing our troops fighting, Liz Cheney. How about that? The good news is in her state, she’s been censured, and in her state, her poll numbers have dropped faster than any human being I’ve ever seen. So hopefully they’ll get rid of her with the next election. Get rid of them all. Democrats are vicious. Remember this, it’s true. Democrats are vicious. He said evil, well, there is evil there, but they’re vicious, they’re smart, and they do one thing. You got to hand it to them. They always stick together. You don’t have Mitt Romney’s in the group. They always stick together. Fortunately, for the Republican party, the Democrats have horrible policies like open borders, sanctuary cities, defunding the police, and the ridiculous, totally ridiculous green new deal. So, they stick together, they’re smart. They’re vicious, they got everything going, but their policies are no good. So hence, we have, congratulations, the Republican party. After this, they may not stick with those policies. We have to be careful. No, their policies are horrible. Think of it, defund the police. How did that work out? But if Republicans do not stick together, the rhinos that we’re surrounded with will destroy the Republican party and the American worker, and will destroy our country itself, the rhinos, Republican in name only, but the Republican party is united. The only division is between a handful of Washington DC establishment political hacks, and everybody else all over the country. I think we have tremendous unity. When you look at the crowds outside that want your seats so badly, they will take your seat in two seconds. They want your seat. Congratulations. Congratulations on getting in by the way. I’m very impressed. And that’s why I’m announcing that I will be actively working to elect strong, tough and smart Republican leaders. Speaking of that, I heard Jim Jordan did a great job. Right? Thank you. I heard that from Mark Meadows. I heard it, oh, there he is. Look at that. Hi Jim. I heard you were great. In fact, I hated to follow you. I want to follow other people. I could name them too. I like to follow other people. I heard you were great. Thank you Jim, very much. Jim Jordan. A great, great athlete. People don’t know he was a great wrestler, tremendous numbers of victories. He was a champion. He was college champion for a long period of time. He’s a winner and a leader and he doesn’t play games. He likes to win. He likes to win. And we have a lot of people in our party that like to win Jim, right? But I heard you were great, thank you very much. But we want Republican leaders who are loyal to the voters and who will work proudly for the vision that I’ve laid out today. And what is it? So simple, right? So simple, military, law and order, great trade deals, great education. So simple. I don’t, does anybody get it? What are they doing? Does anybody get it? It has just been stated that President Trump’s endorsement is the most powerful asset in politics. Do you believe that? Who would’ve thought that was going to happen? Who would have thought that’s going to happen, Jim? In last year’s congressional primaries, 120, listen to this, it’s crazy. 120 of 122 candidates I endorsed won, 120. That’s almost as good as Jim’s wrestling record. And the two that lost were beaten by people claiming to be more Trump than their opponent. So I like those two people very much also. In the Senate, I was undefeated in endorsements with a record of 21 and 0, my endorsement of Mitch McConnell, at his request-it’s all right, it’s all right. Now, he made a request. He asked for my endorsement, brought him from one point down to 20 points up, and he won his race in the great state, and actually the great Commonwealth of Kentucky. And he won it very easily. And I said, “I wonder if I’m doing the right thing here.” But you know what? I did what I did. But he went from one point down to 20 points up very quickly, immediately actually. And he won his race. And if you compare that to his other elections, I’m sure you’ll see something interesting. But you know what? We got a Republican elected. And now we have to use Republicans to take care of the election frauds and all of the other things that are happening that shouldn’t be allowed to happen in our country. It’s very simple. Because of my efforts campaigning, we had huge gains in the House, and I helped keep many senators in their seats, and they will admit it, so that it’s now 50/50, instead of Republicans being down anywhere from eight to 10 seats. And they’ll admit it, we’d be down eight to 10 seats if I didn’t campaign. We held rallies for some of the senators that were down. And nobody talks about that. Nobody wants to talk, the press doesn’t talk about it. With me at the top of the ticket, not a single Republican member of Congress lost their race for the first time in decades. We won 26 of 26 toss up races. Toss up. Think of that, 26 of 20, and those are toss up. Those are races that could go any way. We were expected to lose 25 seats, and instead we won 15 seats, and almost, oh, why couldn’t we have done a couple of more, almost cost crazy Nancy her job. We’ll do that the next time around. I received almost, listen to this number, because you know, the fake news doesn’t ever talk about these numbers. I just heard this one for the first time. I received almost 1.5 million more votes than all of the Republican House candidates combined. So how the hell is it possible that we lost? It’s not possible. I got more votes. I got more, which is me, when I say I, I’m talking about we. We, we got more votes than any incumbent, any incumbent president in the history of our country, almost 75 million votes. And that doesn’t include the votes and ballots they threw out. If you include them, you’ll see numbers that are much different. We did even better in the second election than we did in the first, you know I won the first? And we won the second, we did much better. Sort of strange, right? How did you do? Well, we did much better the second time. Oh, you did? Really? What a disgrace, what a disgrace to our country. I got over 11 million, very close to 12 million more votes than we got in 2016. And I was told by John McLaughlin that if you, the great pollster, that if you get to, we had 63 in 2016, 63 million. Sir, if you get to 66 million, you have it made. We got to almost 75 million. Then what the hell happened? What happened? What happened when they closed all of the counting booths? What happened at 3:00 in the morning? What happened at 3:02 in the morning? What happened? No president has ever lost an election after carrying Florida, Ohio, and Iowa. And I won them all. And I won them by a lot. By a lot. I won 94% of the primary vote, no incumbent president who received more than 75% of the primary vote has ever lost an election. I had a record number, and no president has ever, ever, and we’re talking about a much lower number than we got, has ever lost an election. Thanks to my coattails, thank you. We have to have a sense of humor. Thanks to my coattails, democrats failed to flip a single state legislature. Think of it, or a legislative chamber, because Republicans came out to vote for me. Now they say it differently. The press, the fake news spins it differently. They say, “Despite how well they did, Trump didn’t win.” That’s such a lie. And many legislators, many legislators told me, they said, they were going to lose their race. It wasn’t going to happen. And then what happened is one in particular told me from a great swing state, said, “You know, I thought I was going to lose my position, lose my race. And I went out with my wife the night before the election. And I saw all these Trump signs and the American flags and the spirits on the streets.” I said, “You know, darling, I think we’re going to win.” He said, “But you were far, far, far more popular than me.” They do lots of polls. You were way, way ahead of me, sir. And the next day I was right. He said, he won the election by a lot, and you lost the election. And sir, it’s not possible that you lost, because you got a lower number than I did. And you were so far ahead of me. You’re the person that brought everybody out to vote. And I happen to agree with that 1, 000%. never forget that conversation. He couldn’t believe it. And I’ve heard it from more than one. And in November, 18 of 19 bellwether counties, you heard about the bellwether counties? 18 of 19 bellwether counties that have correctly predicted every presidential election election for decades. Many decades, voted for Trump, not for Biden. And it was a shocker to those people that go for the stats. It was a shocker. They voted for Trump, 18 of 19 voted for Trump. There’s never been anything like that. And yet did Biden win? No. If you want to help us take back the future of our country, go to DonaldJTrump.com. I don’t do this. I’ve never done this, but it’s time that we have to put forces together, because these people with their big tech and their fake news media right back there, okay? And you know, when you talk about election, they turn off. When you talk about, they probably have them going, because they also care about ratings. But when they talk about election, they turn off the cameras. You know why? It’s a very sore subject, okay? They don’t like that subject. There’s only one way to contribute to our efforts, to elect America first Republican conservatives, and in turn to make America great again, and that’s through Save America, PAC, and DonaldJTrump.com. So go out there and do whatever you can because we’re going to help a lot of great people. We know the right people to help. We need your help to win, and to fight big tech and the radical left and the DC establishment. We need to save your second amendment, which is under siege. We need to help protect funding for our military and for our great vets. And that’s what we’re doing. As we discussed earlier, we’re in a struggle for the survival of America as we know it. This is a struggle. This is a terrible, terrible, painful struggle. The path ahead will not be easy, but we will win. We are going to win. Ultimately we always win. And when we do, history will show that this was the moment when we could have given up, when we could have despaired. But instead, we chose to keep on pushing forward. The greater the challenge and tougher the task, the more determined we must be to pull through to triumph. We have to have triumph. We have to have victory. With the talent and dedication of everyone here today, and you have tremendous, not only dedication, tremendous talent in this room. I know many of you. That is exactly what we will do. We will go on to victory. We will summon the spirit of generations of American Patriots before us, like those heroes who crossed the Delaware, conquered the Rockies, stormed the beaches, won the battles, and tamed the unknown frontiers. We will persist, and we will prevail. We’re tougher than they are. We’re stronger than they are. Together, in the coming years, we will carry forward the torch of American Liberty. We will lead the conservative movement and the Republican party back to a totally conclusive victory. And we’ve had tremendous victories. Don’t ever forget it. With your help, we will take back the House. We will win the Senate. And then, a Republican president will make a triumphant return to the White House. And I wonder who that will be? I wonder who that will be? Who, who, who will that be? I wonder. Standing before you today, I am supremely confident that for our movement, for our party, and for our country, our brightest days are just ahead. And that together we will make America prouder, freer, stronger and greater than it ever has been before. Thank you CPAC, God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you all. Thank you.

"9","07-10-20","Hello, everybody. We’re going to Miami. We’re going to different parts of Florida today. We’ll be back at about 11 o’clock tonight, and a lot of stops, a lot of very good stuff. We look forward to it. Tropical storm Fay is probably going to be hitting a place called New Jersey, a good place, pretty soon. We are on the watch. We are fully prepared. FEMA’s ready in case it’s bad. It shouldn’t be too bad, but you never know. You never know, but at this moment it’s looking like it’s going to be hitting New Jersey fairly soon. We are fully prepared and other than that, I’ll see you in Miami. Okay? Thank you. Say it? He plagiarized from me, but he can never pull it off. He likes to plagiarizing. It’s a plan that is very radical left, but he said the right things because he’s copping what I’ve done. The difference is he can’t do it and he knows he’s not doing that. He can’t be the same because he’s raising taxes way too much. He’s raising everybody’s taxes. He’s also putting tremendous amounts of regulations back on. Those two things are two primary reasons that I created the greatest economy we’ve ever had. Now we’re creating it again. Okay? Well, I’ll be looking at it. I think Roger Stone was very unfairly treated as were many people. In the meantime, Comey and all these guys are walking around including Biden and Obama because we caught them spying on my campaign. Who would have believed that one? Thank you."
"10","07-13-20","Thank you all very much for being at the White House; very special house, very special place. I’m grateful to be joined by citizens whose lives have been saved by law enforcement heroes. And that’s what they are the heroes. And they’re being very unfairly treated over the last long period of time, but over the last few years. It’s terrible what’s happening. We’re also joined by two amazing officers, South Carolina Deputy Sheriff William Kimbro. Where’s William? William. William. What happened to William? Okay. That’s a good excuse. That’s good. And Palm Beach County, Deputy Sheriff Corey Reese. Hi Corey, good. In recent weeks, our country’s police officers have been really under siege. I want to thank … First of all, I do want to thank Vice President Pence for all the work he’s done on this. And in particular Attorney General Bill Barr, because the job he’s done has been amazing. It’s been 24 hours a day, I guess I could say 28 hours a day, right? It never ends, but it’s been a great job that you both done. We appreciate it, Mike. We appreciate it very much. But our officers have been under vicious assault and hundreds of police have been injured and several murdered. You’ve been reading about it, just like I’ve been seeing it. Reckless politicians have defamed our law enforcement heroes as the enemy. They call them the enemy. They actually go and say that they’re enemy and even call them an invading army. These radical politicians want to defund and abolish the police from our nation. At first, when I first heard it, I said, “Well, that’s just something that they’re saying.” But they actually are trying to do it. You look at what’s going on in Minneapolis. You look at what’s going on in many Democrat run areas, but they want to defund and they want to abolish. Far-left mayors are escalating the anti-cop crusade and violent crime is spiraling in their cities. It’s all far left cities where they have no understanding of what has to be done. They don’t have a clue. I will say that we put on a very powerful rule in law that you get 10 years, you’re knocked down a monument. If it’s a federal monument, you go to jail for 10 years. If it’s anything else, we tell them we work with the states to help them. But if you do anything where it’s a federal monument and there are a lot of them up there and nobody’s been attacked, nothing’s been attacked since we did, 10 years in jail, monument or statue. In one recent week in New York City, this is hard to believe, shootings were up 358%. And yet they spend all their time, they want to do Black Lives Matter signs outside of Trump Tower. That ought to spend their time doing something else, because I’ll tell you what, 358% increase in shootings in New York. Last month, over 300 people were shot. NYPD retirements have quadrupled and they’re going up even further. And New York City is out of control. Unfortunately, my place, I love it, but it’s out of control. It was doing so well. Rudy Giuliani, whether you like Rudy or not, he did a great job. He was the greatest mayor in the history of New York. Murders in Atlanta up 133% compared to the same period last year. And one of the victims was an eight year old girl. Then we’ve had younger than that in Chicago last weekend. In the last two weeks, 105 Americans were shot in Philadelphia. In Minneapolis, the city voted to disband the police department and cut it way down, but disband it ultimately. The radical politicians are waging war on innocent Americans. That’s what you’re doing when you play with the police. My administration is pro-safety, pro-police and anti-crime. And I will say, I just see a new number came in from Chicago, this weekend was a scourge. This weekend was, I guess, 20 people killed in many, many shootings. Many, many shootings, far worse than the last week. Things are happening that nobody’s ever seen happening happen. In cities that are liberally run, I call them radical lib, and yet they’ll go and march on areas and rip everything down in front of them. If that’s what you want for a country, you probably have to vote for sleepy Joe Biden, because he doesn’t know what’s happening, but you’re not going to have it with me. We’ve been very strong on law enforcement. We’ll be doing things that you’ll be, I think very impressed with. Numbers are going to be coming down even if we have to go in and take over cities because we can’t let that happen. When you have 20 people killed, 22 people killed in one weekend in Chicago. When you have 88 shootings, it’s not even conceivable. That’s worse than Afghanistan. I hate to say it. That’s worse than any war zone that we’re in, by a lot. It makes them look like tame places by comparison so we’re not going to let it go on. Supposed to wait for them to call, but they don’t call. We’ve asked Chicago, ” Would you like us to go in and help?” And they don’t want to say anything. We’ve called many of the cities. “Would you like us to go and help?” We’ve done a great job in Portland. Portland was totally out of control and they went in and I guess we have many people right now in jail and we very much quelled it. And if it starts again, well quell it again, very easily. It’s not hard to do if you know what you’re doing. I just want to thank everybody for being here. I’ll maybe ask Vice President Pence to say a couple of words, and then I’d like Bill Barr to say something and we’ll go around the room. Okay? Thank you very much. Thank you, everybody. Thank you, Mike. Bill? Thank you, Bill. I appreciate it. Maybe what we’ll do is we’ll go around the room and maybe you could introduce yourself and explain exactly what’s going on. You have an incredible story, please. Saved her. Wow. You don’t hear those stories. That’s why I think it’s important to have a meeting like this. A little different. And it’s the meeting that we should have about a hundred times out of almost a hundred. This is the one because the police do such a job. And there’s an example. That’s fantastic. That’s fantastic. And did you know the gentleman on your left? Come on. Let’s go. Let’s tell that story please. Do you know? Do you want to go ahead? Please. Yes. Go ahead. Great job. Well, that’s what I meant when I kiddingly said … That’s what I meant when I kiddingly said, “Do you know the gentlemen to your left,” because you really know him. That’s what I meant and great job you’ve done. Thank you very much on behalf of all of us. And Camira, congratulations. Thank you for being here. Thank you. Thank you both. Please, go ahead. That’s great. So again, the police did a great job and the group did a great job and so Spencer has no sense of danger, so you would say basically he’s very brave, okay? View it that way. Thank you very much for being here. We appreciate it. Thank you. Brooke, please. Well thank you very much Brooke. What’s more astonishing to me is that we’ll call, Bill will call, Vice President will call, I’ll call. You’ll call leaders of these cities, Democrat leaders, and we don’t care if they’re Democrat or not, they happen to be in every case, but we’ll call them and we’ll say, “Do you need help?” They’ll say, “No.” I said, “But you just had 40 people shot and many people killed this weekend.” They’ll say, “No, we’re okay.” I’ll say, “What’s that all about?” We’re tired of those answers. We’re tired of those answers, so thank you. To me that’s astonishing. Thank you very much Brooke. Please. How are you doing now then? So that’s a lot of times that you had difficulty. How are you doing? Good. Fun. Great. That’s a fantastic job. Thank you very much. That’s an equally incredible statement, you understand what you’re doing now, so that’s great. Six years, almost six years. That’s fantastic. Good luck. We’ll see you … In let’s say celebrate in 10, okay, we’ll see you in 10. So we’ll see you in another four years, all right? That’s fantastic news. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Please. Thank you. Well that’s great. Thank you very much. It’s an incredible story. So how seriously … How long did it take to recover? How bad was it? Okay. That's a great job. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Thank you for being here. Please. Good. Well that’s a great story. I thought you were going to tell me that they wanted to arrest you for giving them a couple of bucks and they deserve it very much but you know I’ve heard the other end of those stories also. You’re not allowed to do anything and you’re right about it. What the police have been going through over the last number of years in all fairness, it’s been starting but it’s never been like this, has it? It’s never been like this. It’s crazy. It’s crazy and they’ll find out it will go the opposite direction unfortunately at some point. It will go absolutely opposite when they see … You’re going to have some defunding and abolishing and you’ll see numbers like nobody would ever believe and they’re going to say, “Let’s get our police back as soon as we can.” That’s great what you just … That’s a fantastic thing. That's a lot. That's a lot. Good job. Thank you very much. That's great. Great stories. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Thank you. Yeah. That's great. Thank you very much. Two in the morning. Why did he … That’s a strange time. So you found him to be okay? Even though he came at two in the morning? Yeah, now they were there. That's great. Good. Thank you very much. Thank you. Really nice. Please. Thank you. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Beautiful. Please. Thank you very much. Great story. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. You're doing a great job too. Please. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Thank you. It’s called natural instinct more than anything else. Thank you very much. Great job. Appreciate it. Well, you’ve said it all. That’s a case that’s still going now? It’s still going? I see. Well, good luck with it. Good luck. Beautiful guy too. Beautiful. That’s just a few stories of the thousands and thousands of stories that we could tell. We’ll probably be doing this again. But the police, they do a great job. They do a fantastic job and they don’t get the kind of … I will say this. The people of this country appreciate the police. They appreciate all they’ve done. You don’t see that if you watch the news. For the most part, you don’t see things like this, but they’ve done a fantastic job. Everybody here is a witness to that and we see it a lot. The Attorney General sees it every day, but we see it a lot. I just want to thank the various police departments, law enforcement. They’ve done an incredible job in this country where they’re allowed to do their work, they really do a job. Thank you all very much for being here. Good luck with your case. Really, terrific job everybody. Terrific job. Thank you. Would anybody from the media like to ask anybody a question, up here? Steve, go ahead please. Well, I have a very good relationship with Dr. Fauci. I’ve had for a long time, right from the beginning. I find him to be a very nice person. I don’t always agree with him. I closed the border, as you know, to China. I closed. I did the ban on China, heavily infected and we saved tens of thousands of lives and Dr. Fauci will admit that it was a good decision. It was very early. That was in January, long before it was thought of as the right thing to do. I also closed the borders to Europe when Italy and a couple of other countries over there, France, certainly Spain, they were having a lot of problems. I closed the borders very early, shortly after I did with China. We saved a lot of lives. We’ve made a lot of good decisions. But no, I get along with him very well. I like him personally. Please. I can't hear you. Well, he’s got a case going on right now. I don’t know this for a fact, but I think he’s doing very well with respect to his case. I hope that he’s going to be able to win it and I don’t have a decision to make until I find out what’s going to happen. But I think he was persecuted. He didn’t lie. It turned out he didn’t lie. The FBI said he didn’t lie. I think he was persecuted. And nobody understands what’s going on with the judge, the Justice Department, which is so capable. They decided to take a view on it and they decided that he should be… they were going to drop the case. So he’s right now, meaning his lawyers and him, are embroiled in hopefully the final stages of what should have never happened. They treated him very unfairly, as they have many people on this side. Yeah, please. That's right. You know that we have one of the lowest mortality rates anywhere. If you know Biden and Obama stopped their testing, they just stopped it. You probably know that. I’m sure you don’t want to report it, but they stopped testing right in the middle. They just went, “No more testing,” and on a much lesser problem than the problem that we have, obviously, with respect to… this is the worst thing that’s happened since probably 1917. This is very bad. All over the world, there’s 188 countries right now. But no, we test more than anybody by far. And when you test, you create cases. So we’ve created cases. I can tell you some countries they test when somebody walks into a hospital sick or walks into maybe a doctor’s office, but usually a hospital, that’s the testing they do, so they don’t have cases, whereas we do. We have all of these cases, so it’s a double edged sword. At the same time, we have the lowest mortality or just about the lowest mortality in the world. We’re doing a great job. We’re doing very well with vaccines and we’re doing very, very well with therapeutics. And I think we’re going to have some very good information coming out soon. But we have the best and certainly the biggest, by far the biggest testing program anywhere in the world. If you tested China or Russia or any of the larger countries, if you tested India, as an example, the way we test you’d see numbers that would be very surprising. Brazil too. Brazil is going through a big problem, but they don’t do testing like we do. We do the testing and by doing the testing, we have tremendous numbers of cases. If we didn’t do this… as an example, we’ve done 45 million tests. If we did half that number, you’d have half the cases probably around that number. If we did another half of that, you’d have half the numbers. Everyone would be saying, “Oh, we’re doing so well on cases.” But when I see it reported in the night, you can check me out of this. I mean, they always talk about… they’re always talking about cases, the number of cases. Well, it is a big factor that we do. We have a lot of cases because we have a lot of testing, far more than any other country in the world. And it’s also the best testing. Yeah. Please. Well, I think what I’m going to do is allow that to be answered by our Attorney General. Do you mind, Bill? Well, I’ve looked at it very strongly. And in this particular case, I’m dealing with Bill and all of the people at Justice. And it’s always tough. You’re talking about the death penalty, but when you talk about people that did what this particular person did, that’s tough also. We’re going to see what happens. Right now they have a stay, I believe, right? They have a stay and we’ll let the courts determine the final outcome and that’s what’s going to happen. Okay. Well, if you look back on it, this was an investigation that should have never taken place. You have guys like Comey, you have McCabe, you have Strzok, you have his lover, Lisa Page, you have all of these people running around, you have Brennan and Clapper who lied to Congress, you have many, many people, you have people that change documents going into the FISA Courts, and it’s a terrible thing. And this is an investigation that they said should have ended before it started. It shouldn’t have started, and if it did, it should have ended immediately because they found, as you know, as well as I do, they found nothing initially, but it went on for two years or longer. And no, I did. I’m getting rave reviews for what I did for Roger Stone. And he frankly, is going to go and now appeal his case. He had a jury forewoman who hated Roger Stone and who hated probably me, but she went on a false pretense and he wasn’t given a fair trial. He wasn’t. It’s not a fair trial. He wasn’t given another trial. He should have been given another trial. I won’t say more. I won’t talk about the judge. I’m not going to. Why would I ever talk about a judge? But this was a judge that gave, I believe solitary confinement to Paul Manafort. Al Capone didn’t have solitary confinement. These are things that happened. And if you look at President Bush, President Clinton, President Obama, take a look at what they did. Frankly, it’s very unfair Roger Stone was treated very unfairly in my opinion. And so were many others this side. In the meantime, you have the other ones who are admitted lying before… they admitted they lied before Congress, they leaked classified information, which is something you just can’t do. And what are they doing? We’ll see what happens, but no, we’re we’re getting rave reviews for what I did. Okay. Well, we’re going to see it built up a little bit, but we’re going to do something that will be great. We think we’re doing very well. We had some poll numbers a little while ago that a great. It’s the same story. It’s a suppression polls that we had in 2016, phony polls. Fake news, phony polls, same thing. And we’re doing very well. We’re doing well in Georgia. We’re doing well in Texas. I read where I was one point up in Texas. I’m not one point up in Texas. We’re many points up. I saved the oil industry. Two months ago, I saved the oil industry. There would have been… I created it. We became number one, we have millions of jobs and we saved it. Texas is not going to have to let go of millions and millions of people. Oklahoma, North Dakota, many states. We’re $40 a barrel. And yet you can buy gasoline for under $2. Nobody’s ever seen like this. We have the biggest energy in the world. When number one oil as you know, oil and gas by far. We’re now number one in the world. And we would have had millions of people out of work. I saved it. And then they say I’m leading by one point in Texas. They said it last time too. They said, Texas is too close to call. This was like three months before the election. And then I won Texas in a blow out. They called it the minute the polls closed. They said that about Utah. They said that about Georgia. They said the same thing, that Georgia is, “Oh, we can’t, it’s too close. They’ll never be able to determine. We’ll have to wait until election night.” On election night, two seconds after the poll closed, they called Georgia. It’s the same thing. And we have the same thing. They’re phony polls. They’re suppression polls. But to think that after saving the oil and gas business and millions and millions of jobs, I’m leading Texas by one point. I don’t think so. Go ahead. It’s intact. It’s intact, but I think what China has done to the world with what took place, the China plague, you call it the China virus, you can call it whatever you want to call it. It’s about 20 different names. What they did to the world should not be forgotten. But it’s intact. They’re buying. Whether they buy or not, that’s up to them. They’re buying. Yeah. The school should be opened. Schools should be opened. Kids want to go to school. You’re losing a lot of lives by keeping things closed. We did the right thing. We saved millions of lives. We saved millions of lives while we did the initial closure. Had we not done what we did, we would’ve had two to … Mike and I were talking about it before 2 to 3 million lives lost, but we did that. We’re at about 135,000 and we’ll be somewhat higher than that by the time it ends. And again, the vaccines are happening and the therapeutics are happening, but I’m not even talking about that. We’ll be at a somewhat high, but we would have lost 2 million, 3 million lives had we not done it. Now we understand it also. We understand there are certain vulnerabilities, young children. I was with, talking to Governor Murphy and they have thousands of lives, I won’t even say how many, just thousands of lives, hard to believe in New Jersey. And he said there was only one life that was 18 or younger, one person died. And that was a person, a young man that had some medical difficulty. When you think of that with thousands of lives and you have one person that was under 18, that’s something, that tells you for some reason, I guess, the immune system is much stronger with young people than it is for others. We have to watch the group that does have the difficulty, does have the problem. We all know what that is. We all know who they are, especially if they have a medical problem. If they have a medical problem, diabetes or heart or anything, it’s a big problem. But we’re being very careful, but we have to open the schools. Would you agree with that? Do you agree? Yeah. We have to open the schools. We have to get them open. And I think there’s a lot of politics going along. I think they think they’ll do better if they can keep the schools closed in the election. I don’t think it’s going to help them, frankly. But I think they feel that by keeping schools closed, that’s a bad thing for the country and therefore that’s a good thing for them. But they’re the ones who city’s burning. I mean, can you imagine if the country was run like Chicago and like New York and like some of these other Democrat super radical left cities are run. You wouldn’t have a country for very long and the economy would crash. We just set a brand new record today on NASDAQ again. This is now I think the 18th time since, and this has since… after the problems. We have a new stock market high for NASDAQ, and the other ones are getting very close. When I came here, the stock market was up almost 500 points today. The economy is rebuilding. Jobs are being produced at a record pace. We’ve never had a pace like this. And I will tell you if Biden got in, this economy would be destroyed. He was in office for 48 years, and what he did was not great. Almost every decision was a wrong decision. And now he’s going to come in and try and help us. We didn’t need any help. We built the greatest economy in history, greatest economy we’ve ever had, the greatest economy the world has ever seen. And then the plague came in from China and we started… we did the right thing. We had to close it down. Now we’re opening it up. He can’t do it. He doesn’t have the capability to do it. Thank you all very much. I appreciate it. Thank you. Good luck with everything. Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate it.
















"
"11","07-14-20","Too hot, but it’s pretty warm. Thank you. So we’ve had a big day in the stock market. Things are coming back and they’re coming back very rapidly. A lot sooner than people thought. People are feeling good about our country. People are feeling good about therapeutics and possible vaccines, but we’re going to go over quite a bit and maybe at the end, we’ll take some questions if we have time, it’s not too hot. Today, I signed legislation and an executive order to hold China accountable for its oppressive actions against the people of Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Autonomy Act, which I signed this afternoon, passed unanimously through Congress. This law gives my administration powerful new tools to hold responsible the individuals and the entities involved in extinguishing Hong Kong’s freedom. We’ve all watched what happened, not a good situation. Their freedom has been taken away. Their rights have been taken away and with it goes Hong Kong, in my opinion, because it will no longer be able to compete with free markets. A lot of people will be leaving Hong Kong, I suspect. And we’re going to do a lot more business because of it because we just lost one competitor. It’s the way it is. We lost a very, very serious competitor. A competitor that we incentivized to take a lot of business and do well and we gave them a lot of business by doing what we did. We gave them things that nobody else had the right to do, and that gave them a big edge over other markets. And because of that edge, they’ve done really historic business, tremendous business, far bigger than anybody would have thought years ago when we did this gift. It was really a gift to freedom. Today, I also signed an executive order ending US preferential treatment for Hong Kong. Hong Kong will now be treated the same as Mainland China, no special privileges, no special economic treatment and no export of sensitive technologies. In addition to that, as you know, we’re placing massive tariffs and have placed very large tariffs on China. First time that’s ever happened to China. Billions of dollars have been paid to the United States of which I’ve given quite a bit to the farmers and ranchers of our country because they were targeted. And that’s been going on for three years. It’s the first time anybody’s ever done anything like that. And prior to the plague pouring in from China, they were having the worst year as you know, in 67 years. And I don’t want them to have a bad year. I want them to have a good year, but they were taking advantage of the United States for many, many years, and that’s stopping. But then the virus came in and the world is a different place, but we’re now getting back and one of the reasons the market’s doing… so it’s almost at the point that it was at prior to the plague. Almost, we’re getting very close. It’s a great thing. It’s an amazing thing what our people have done and what they’ve endured. No administration has been tougher on China then this administration. We imposed historic tariffs. We stood up to China’s intellectual property theft at a level that nobody’s ever come close. We confronted untrustworthy Chinese technology and telecom providers. We convinced many countries, many countries, and I did this myself for the most part, not to use Huawei because we think it’s an unsafe security risk. It’s a big security risk. I talked many countries out of using it. If they want to do business with us, they can’t use it. Just today, I believe that UK announced that they’re not going to be using it. And that was up in the air for a long time but they’ve decided. And you look at Italy, you look at many other countries. We withdrew from the Chinese dominated, WHO and we fully rebuilt the United States military. The WHO, World Health Organization, we were paying close to $500 million a year. China was paying $39 million a year. And China had too much say, they worked it very hard, which is a bad thing done by our past administrations. But we were tough and we were saying, I was asking, I said, “Why are we paying so much more than China?” China has 1.4 billion people. We have 325, probably 325 million approximately, nobody can give the exact count. We’re trying to get an exact count, but you have over the years, many illegals who have come into the country. So it depends on how you want to count it. But you could say 325 to 350 million people, as opposed to 1.4 billion people. And the World Trade is terrible, that deal is terrible. The World Health is terrible deal. We’ve been very tough on the World Trade Organization and we’ve been, I guess, as tough as you can get on World Health. We withdrew our money. We told them we’re getting out. It doesn’t mean that someday we won’t go back in. Maybe we will when it’s correctly run, but they made a lot of bad predictions and they said a lot of bad things about what to do and how to do it and they turned out to be wrong. And they were really a puppet of China. And make no mistake, we hold China fully responsible for concealing the virus and unleashing it upon the world. Could have stopped it, they should have stopped. It would have been very easy to do at the source when it happened. In contrast, Joe Biden’s entire career has been a gift to the Chinese Communist Party and to the calamity of errors that they’ve made. They made so many errors and it’s been devastating for the American worker. China has taken out hundreds of billions of dollars a year from our country. And we rebuilt China. I give them all the credit in the world. I don’t give the credit for the people that used to stand here because they allowed this to happen where hundreds of billions of dollars were taken out of the United States Treasury in order to rebuild China. There’s no company and no country in the world, no country in the world has ever ripped off the United States like the incredible job that they did on this country and the people that ran it. Possibly, it’s one of the reasons, certainly it’s one of the very big reasons trade and things related to trade that I got elected in the first place. I’ve been talking about it for a long time, along with many other subjects, frankly. Joe Biden supported China’s entry into the World Trade Organization. One of the greatest geopolitical and economic disasters in world history. If you look at China, you look at the moment they joined the World Trade, they were flatlining for years and years and years and decades. And then all of a sudden they joined the World Trade Organization and they went like a rocket ship. They were given all sorts of advantages. They were considered a developing country. As a developing country they got tremendous advantages over the United States and other countries, and they took advantage of those advantages and then some. Biden personally led the effort to give China permanent, most favored nation status, which is a tremendous advantage for a country to have. Few countries have it. But the United States doesn’t have it. Never did, probably never even asked for it because they didn’t know what they were doing. As Vice President Biden was a leading advocate of the Paris Climate Accord, which was unbelievably expensive to our country. Would have crushed American manufacturers while allowing China to pollute the atmosphere with impunity yet one more gift from Biden to the Chinese Communist Party. They took all of the advantage away from us. They took everything away. They don’t have oil. We would have had to close up a tremendous amounts of our energy to qualify, eventually, not too far into the future. We would have had to do things that would have been unbelievably destructive to our country, including the possible closing of 25% of our businesses, think of that. And it was going to cost us hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars for the privilege of being involved in the Paris Climate Accord. And you just have to look at what took place this year in Paris and France, where money was being sent to countries all over the world and the people of France didn’t want to take it. And they didn’t. And they did a lot of rioting. They had their taxes raised. We would have had to raise our taxes and it was a disaster. I’ve been given a lot of credit for what I did there. Took a certain amount of courage, I guess, because it sounds so nice, the Paris Climate Accord. But it wasn’t good for us at all. America lost nearly 10,000 factories while Joe Biden was Vice President, think of that. 10,000 factories. He wrote something today and he made a statement today that I wrote down. It’s pretty accurate. So Biden was here for 47 years. Eight years, the last eight years, not long ago as Vice President he said, “One in five miles of our highways are still in poor condition.” Well, we’re doing a good job on highways, but why didn’t he fix them three years ago? Why didn’t he fix them? Tens of thousands of bridges are in disrepair and on the verge of collapse. Well, that’s probably not a right number, but we have bridges that should have been fixed. Why didn’t he fix him? He was here for eight years with President Obama. Why didn’t they fix them? Tens of thousands of bridges. This is what he wrote. High speed broadband. We want high speed… well, why didn’t they get it? Three years ago is not a long time and he didn’t do any of the things, but now he says he’s going to be president and as president, he’s going to do all the things that he didn’t do. He never did anything except make very bad decisions, especially on foreign policy. So Joe Biden and President Obama freely allowed China to pillage our factories, plunder our communities and steal our most precious secrets. And I’ve stopped it, largely, but I’ve stopped it and it wasn’t easy because you talk about a certain power of the telephone and the calls where they would call and say, “No, we don’t want to do that.” And other countries would call on behalf of China, but I did it. I did what has to be done. And you just take a look at what’s gone on and take a look at the numbers where they devalued their currency in order to pay the tariffs. Now, the Democrat party is calling for defunding of our military, think of that. Defunding, they want to defund our military when China is building a massive military. They’re building a massive military and Biden wants to defund our military and the world needs American strength right now, more than ever. And we’ve got it. We’ve got now, soon as all this equipment comes in, all made in the USA, we’ve got the newest, most incredible weapons anywhere in the world. We have the best tanks, the best ships, the best missiles, rockets. We have the best of everything. We have the best fighter jets, the F-35, the F-18. All of these assets are being built, tankers, incredible tankers, bombers. Hope we don’t have to use them, but we have the most incredible military. When I came in the military was totally depleted. It was at a level that was just absolutely incredible. You know the statements, I made the statements before. I told you what generals told me about our military and I’ll make them again. If somebody needs them, we’ll give them to you. Very well documented. As Vice President Biden opposed tariffs, and he was standing up for China. He didn’t want to do anything to disrupt the relationship with China even though China was taking us to the cleaners. He opposed my very strict travel ban on Chinese nationals to stop the spread of the China virus. He was totally against it. Xenophobic, he called me. Xenophobic. A month later, he admitted I was right. We would have had thousands of people additionally die if we let people come in from heavily infected China, but we stopped it. We did a travel ban in January. Nancy Pelosi was dancing in the streets of Chinatown in San Francisco a month later and even later than that and others too. They all thought what I did was a terrible mistake. We would have lost… in fact, Dr. Fauci said we would have lost thousands of additional people if President Trump had to do that. And I was a crowd of one, because even experts didn’t want to do it. They thought it was a mistake. And then I did Europe. When I started seeing what was going on in Italy and Spain and France and other countries in Europe I did a ban on people coming in from Europe. That would have been disastrous for our country also. And we saved tens of thousands of lives, but we actually saved millions of lives. By closing up, we saved millions, potentially, millions of lives. Could be, a number that we’re actually working on, but it could be 2 to 3 million lives. So we’re at 135,000, which is terrible. One is too much, but we would have had millions of people dead from this curse that came at us, but we did what we had to do. And now we’ll put out the flames as it happens. We have to get the schools open. We have to get everything open. A lot of people don’t want to do that for political reasons, not for other reasons. But if we had listened to Joe Biden, hundreds of thousands of additional lives would have been lost. And if you look at the job he did on swine flu, I looked at a poll. They have polls on everything nowadays and they got very bad marks on the job they did on the swine flu. H1N1, he calls it N1H1. H1N1 got very poor marks from Gallup on the job they did on swine flu. And they stopped very early on, testing. They totally stopped it. They just said stop. And frankly, if we didn’t test, you wouldn’t have all the headlines because we’re showing cases. And frankly, if we didn’t test, you wouldn’t have all the headlines because we’re showing cases. And we have just about the lowest mortality rate. But if we did… Think of this, if we didn’t do testing, instead of testing over 40 million people, if we did half the testing, we would have half the cases. If we did another… You cut that in half, we’d have yet again, half of that, but the headlines are always testing. Now the testing is a good thing, but at the same time, it’s fodder for the fake news to report cases. So we’re doing 40 million plus, going to be very close to 45 million people. And when I turned on the news, I see cases, cases, cases. They don’t talk about deaths being cut down to a level that actually tenfold they use. I got that from one of the very respected media outlets, tenfold, cut tenfold, yes, but they don’t talk about that. They talk about cases and the cases are created because of the fact that we do tremendous testing. We’re the best testing in the world. We now make ventilators for the world. We had very few ventilators. There wasn’t one person in any hospital anywhere in this country that needed a ventilator that didn’t get it. And that was because we mobilized to a level, using the Purchasing Act in some cases, we mobilized to a level that nobody thought possible. Nothing’s happened like that since World War II. Our task force has done a great job. Mike Pence works so hard, gets so little credit. Sad to see that actually, but he works so hard, gets so little credit. The governors would tell us, we’d be on the phone with 50 different governors, they’d all tell us what a great job, great job. And then they’ll go to the media and say, “Well, they didn’t do such a good job.” Well, we did a great job. We made a lot of governors look fantastic. We did in New York, what we did in New York was one of the most incredible things, 2,800 bed in Javits Center, but the governor used very few of them unfortunately. Then we moved in our great hospital ship, one of our two great… We move one also to Los Angeles. And we could have used that for our senior citizens. We could have used it for other people. They could have used it instead of sending our seniors back into nursing homes that were infected where you lost thousands of people. Thousands of people in New York died because of poor management by the governor. And it’s a very sad thing to see and very sad to watch and very sad to look at those statistics. But we have an incredible Javits Center that we built with thousands of beds. I think it was 2,800 all ready to go and they could have sent people there, or they could have sent senior citizens there instead of sending them into the nursing homes. And after all of that work and getting it done, the Army Corps of Engineers, I mean, the job they did was incredible. They built it in a matter of days. When it was all completed, FEMA, everybody was there, doctors. We ended up getting doctors. They said, “We can’t man it.” I said, “So we’ll man it and woman it.” And that’s what we did. We brought in doctors, nurses, everything, we’re all set. We said, “Where are the people?” They didn’t send the people. Very few people came in. They could have sent them into the Javits Center. They could have sent him to the hospital ship, which was virtually unused. But we were there. By contrast, my administration acted very early to ban travel from China, from Europe, saving all of these lives, incredible. And I want everyone to know, I want every citizen now that we’re using the full power of the Federal government to fight the China virus and to keep our people safe. Through Operation Warp Speed, we will deliver a vaccine in record breaking time. We’re doing very well on the vaccines. We have many, many different vaccines being studied right now, many of which are looking really good. And we’re ready to distribute the vaccine when we get it. We’re all set, taking a risk, an economic risk of preparing for delivery because we feel very certain it’s going to be there, but logistically we have our military ready to go. We have generals that that’s all they do is distribute things and they’re going to be distributing hopefully a vaccine or a therapeutic, and it’s coming out really well. And I think you’re going to have some good news very, very quickly having to do with the vaccines. We’re also working with many other countries on the vaccine. Many countries are working with us. We’re unleashing our nation’s scientific genius to kill the virus. Joe Biden didn’t just side with China on the virus, he did. He called me again, xenophobic. That’s what he said. You all heard it many times. He described the rise of China as “a very positive development”. It’s not a positive development. Not for us it’s not. He said that the idea that China is our competition is really bizarre. He’s really bizarre. He said, “China is not a problem.” No, nobody’s ripped us off more than China over the last 25, 30 years, nobody close. And he says China is not a problem. Now he takes it all back. Now he wants to be Mr. Tough Guy. But for years, 47 years, he never came out against China, never say anything bad. Just the opposite. His son walked out with $1.5 billion of money to invest where he’ll make hundreds of thousands of dollars, maybe millions of dollars a year, walked out with $1.5 billion. I asked one of the biggest people on Wall Street, maybe the biggest, “Is that possible?” He said, “No,” he’s never seen it. They don’t do that. But Hunter, where’s Hunter, where is Hunter by the way? Hunter Biden walked out with $1.5 billion. In Ukraine he got $83,000 a month and I guess an upfront payment of $3 million. So he went from not having job to getting $83,000 a month with a lot of money paid up front to work for Burisma. And you all know about Burisma, but nothing happens, nobody cares. And he was unemployed as you know, he was unfortunately forced to leave the military. He was forced to leave. Didn’t have a job and all of a sudden he’s making a fortune, but nobody talks about that. Indeed Biden expressed more fawning praise about China on an ordinary day than about America. On the 4th of July, the last Independence Day, Biden attacked the United States and said we had, “never lived up to the ideals of our fathers, our forefathers, or our founding fathers, those founding ideals.” And yet he enthusiastically stated that China is a great nation and we should hope for its continued expansion. Well, we all wish well to China, but what China has unleashed on the world, it’s hard to even fathom. I see people now, friends of mine, they walk up, they want to say hello, and they have to keep their distance and they’re all covered up like you’re all covered up with face masks. It’s a different world, but we’re coming out on top. Biden sides with China over America time and time again. And he said on the 4th of July, “American history is no fairytale.” And yet blindly celebrates China saying few nations in history have come so far so fast. He’s so proud of them. He’s so proud of them. Now, Joe Biden is pushing a platform that would demolish the U.S. economy, totally demolish it. So we built the greatest economy in the history of our country, greatest in the history of the world. That was a few months ago. Best unemployment numbers ever, best for African American, Asian American, Hispanic American, best for women, best for everybody, best for young people that didn’t have a high school diploma, didn’t have a college diploma. They had a diploma, they were really in good shape. We built the greatest ever stock market, highest ever in history. We had 143 days of all time stock market highs in just less than three and a half years. And we had to close it down because we did the right thing by doing that. As I said, we saved millions of lives, but China was saying this is incredible what’s going on. China was for the first time respecting the United States and now they want to do something that’s much different, Joe Biden. So I’ve watched this and I’ve watched it with great interest. We’re building our economy again. I guess the stock market went up almost 500 points today or something thereabouts, you’ll check. But it was up a lot when I left. And our economy is coming back. We’re almost at a level where even though it’s long before the very important, maybe the most important ever, election of November 3rd. We’re long before that, but we’re close to record stock markets again. And NASDAQ hit an all time high for the 16th time. Think of that, for the 16th time over the last month or so, for the 16th time. So one of our markets already hit an all time high. Today Joe Biden gave a speech in which he said that the core of his economic agenda is a hard left crusade against American energy. He wants to kill American energy. He wants to reenter the unfair one sided Paris Climate Accord, which will destroy us at the expense of many other nations who benefit. It was actually drawn in my opinion, to take advantage of the United States, just like so many other deals that are done to take advantage of the fools running the United States. But this would do nothing for the environment, but would cripple American industry while greatly helping China. He wants to impose massive energy taxes and job crushing mandates to eliminate carbon from the United States economy. Let him define the word carbon because he won’t be able to. Obliterating American oil, clean coal, natural gas, and the natural energy resources that supply countless American jobs. Joe Biden put AOC, a young woman not talented in many ways, in charge of his energy plan and the environment essentially. Her and Bernie Sanders who ran a lot of times for president, never made it. Good base, but that’s about it. In other words, he wants to impose the Green New Deal on our country. When I first saw the Green New Deal, I thought it was a joke. I said, “This will never go anywhere.” Now they’re trying to impose it. This will destroy our country and make us non-competitive with other countries. Don’t forget, we’re in competition with China and with many other countries throughout the world. We’re in tremendous economic competition, including Europe, which has never treated us well. The European union was formed in order to take advantage of the United States. They formed and they take advantage of the United States. And I know that, they know I know that, but other presidents had no idea. Last week, Joe Biden released his unity platform developed with socialist Bernie Sanders, describing what he would do if elected president. The Biden Sanders agenda is the most extreme platform of any major party nominee by far in American history. I think it’s worse than actually Bernie’s platform. It’s gone so far, right? And he’s doing that because he’s begging for that vote. But one of the things I just asked my people to do is just draw up for me just quickly some of the things that we’ve been hearing about over the last couple of weeks. And these are actual key elements of the Biden Sanders unity platform. Abolish immigration detention, no more detention. You come in here illegally, no more detention. Stop all deportations. So if we get a MS-13 gang member, which we’ve taken out of our country by the thousands, brought them back to Honduras, Guatemala, can’t do that anymore. El Salvador, can’t do that anymore. Stop all deportations. In other words, we’ll take all of these people, many of whom are in prison for rape, murder, lots of other things. End prosecution of illegal border crossers. Oh, okay. They come in illegally and we have to stop the whole process. Support the deadly sanctuary cities where many of these people are protected better than the American citizen is protected. Incentivize illegal alien child smuggling. Give it an incentive because if you look at what they’re saying, that’s exactly what they do. Incentivize illegal alien child smuggling. They’re incentivized by what this plan calls for. Expand asylum for all new illegal aliens. How about that one? All new illegal aliens, expand asylum. Cancel all asylum cooperation agreements in the Western hemisphere. Well, we have agreements with Honduras, Guatemala, with El Salvador, we have great agreements where when Biden and Obama used to bring killers out, they would say, “Don’t bring them back to our country. We don’t want them.” Well, we have to, we don’t want them. They wouldn’t take them. Now with us, they take them. Someday I’ll tell you why. Someday I’ll tell you why, but they take them and they take them very gladly. They used to bring them out and they wouldn’t even let the airplanes land if they brought them back by airplanes. They wouldn’t let the buses into their country. They said, “We don’t want them.” They said no, but they entered our country illegally. And they’re murderers, they’re killers in some cases. And they said, “Nope, we don’t want them.” They turned the bus around. They turned the plane around that land in the United States and who knows what happened to him, but it wasn’t good. Taxpayer-funded lawyers will be given to all illegal aliens. So we’re going to pay now for the lawyer’s lobby and we’re going to give all illegal aliens taxpayer-funded lawyers. How does that sound? Pretty good. In other words, come in here illegally, we’re going to give you free legal advice. We’ll take you up to the Supreme Court as much as possible. Abolish immigration enforcement against illegal workers. Think of that, abolish immigration enforcement. They’re going to abolish immigration enforcement. Well, basically, as you know, what they’re going to do is they’re going to rip down the wall. They’re taking it down. They want to take down the wall, which we fought hard for up to 259 miles right now of great powerful wall that’s really working because if you look at the numbers, in addition to the fact…Wall that’s really working because if you look at the numbers, in addition to the fact that Mexico, for various reasons, has 27,000 soldiers on our southern border to keep people out of our country. And I appreciate it. We had a great meeting last week with the President of Mexico. Great guy, friend of mine, become a friend of mine. A lot of people thought that couldn’t happen because we’re very opposite in terms of our views, maybe even in terms of our temperament, but he’s a great guy, and he’s a friend of mine, and they’ve been terrific. Mexico has been terrific. 27,000 soldiers on our border, Mexican soldiers, and we have great, great numbers. We got rid of so many different things. Catch and release is gone. So many different things have taken place. We used to catch them, take their name, and release them into our country. We don’t do that anymore. We now release them back where they came from. Sometimes we’ll bring them back to their country. Grant work permits for illegal aliens, so if you come in illegally, you get a work permit. People that live here don’t get work permits, many cases. Provide taxpayer subsidies and welfare for illegal aliens and new immigrants. So we want to provide taxpayer subsidies and welfare for people that come into our country illegally, illegal immigrants. They want government healthcare for all illegal aliens. This is part of their plan. I’m not making this up. This is all down in their plan from last week. And this is good compared to what I heard today. Federal student aid and free community college for illegal aliens. What do you think about that? Federal student aid and free community college. We’re going to have every person in the world pouring into our country from all over the world. And by the way, the wall was so timely because it stopped people coming in from heavily infected areas of Mexico. If we had that, we would be in trouble like you wouldn’t believe. You wouldn’t believe. And remember, cases is different than deaths. And cases, we give you because our testing is the best in the world. And by the way, by far the most, find out which country tested 45 million people. If China, if Russia, if India tested 45 million people, or if they did tests like we did, check out how many cases they’d have. But it’s still, we’ve done a great job. Get no credit for it. And I don’t want the credit. I want the people that have done this great job. The people that have done such an incredible job when building the ventilators, and doing the testing, and building a testing platform that’s been amazing. We have many platforms. Many companies have come up with different forms of tests. When we started there was no such thing. Sign new immigrants up for welfare immediately. This is Joe Biden. So they walk off and they come in and they put a foot into our land, and we sign up new immigrants up for welfare. We sign them up immediately. They get welfare benefits. United States citizens. Don’t get what they’re looking to give illegal immigrants. Think of that. Sign up. It’s hard to believe I’m even reading that, new immigrants for welfare immediately. Not to mention the cost of this which is incalculable. The cost of this is so crazy. End requirement for immigrant self-sufficiency and maximize their welfare. Now, this is us writing this. Who’s not coming to the United States? Every person from South America is going to pour in. Every person from other countries, they’re going to be pouring in. End requirement, think of that, for immigrant self-sufficiency and remember to maximize welfare. So we give it a maximum. Then we have massively expand immigration during a global pandemic, taking jobs from unemployed Americans. End all travel bans including from Jihadist regions. So now we have travel bans. A lot of you said I didn’t get the travel ban and you were wrong. We got the travel ban. We lost in the Ninth Circuit. We lost again in the Ninth Circuit. And then we won in the Supreme Court. We have a very strong travel ban, and we don’t want people that are going to come in and blow up our cities, do things. And frankly, with the liberal Democrats running the cities that we do have where they do have problems, maybe they wouldn’t mind, but I would mind, and the people of this country mind. So listen to this. End all travel bans. He’s talking about the ban that I won that everybody said I didn’t win. They said I didn’t win because in the Lower Court we lost, that we lost in the Appellate Division and then we won in the Supreme Court. So they said, “He lost,” and they’re right at the Lower Level. But in the meantime, we won in the Supreme Court. So it’s in effect, but they didn’t say that. They said he lost, which again is fake news, but that’s the way they do it. So end all travel bans including from Jihadist regions, they specify that. Grant mass amnesty. Everybody gets amnesty, mass amnesty. Think of that. And this has created a roadmap to citizenship for massive, massive numbers. And we’re not talking about DACA because I’m going to take care of DACA much better than the Democrats did. The Democrats had their chance and they blew it. But we’re going to take care of DACA because I’m going to be doing, in the not too distant future, pretty soon I’m going to be signing a new immigration action, very, very big merit based immigration action. That based on the DACA decision, I’ll be able to do. Vastly expand low-skilled immigration to the United States. So they want a lot of people come in with low skills. I like merit. Think of that. Vastly expand low-skilled immigration to the United States. These are the things that are in the plan. This is Biden. Biden’s gone radical left. Increase refugee admissions by 700%. Huh? That’s a lot, by 700%. Nobody’s ever heard of such a thing. Increase refugee admissions by 700%. Abolish law enforcement as we know it. I think the police do an incredible job in this country. And you’re going to have a rogue, terrible cop on occasion, like you do doing any industry, in any business, in any profession. But I think they do an incredible job. Abolish law enforcement as we know it. End cash bail, no bail. Just, we let you right out. Look at what’s happened to New York. Crime is up. Shootings are up at numbers that nobody’s ever seen before. Look at Chicago. What a disaster. And we’re waiting for them to call us because we’re all set to go. We have the FBI. We have Homeland Security. We have everybody ready to go. We have the National Guard. They’re all ready to go. End cash bail, releasing dangerous criminals onto our streets, cash bail. New York just did that. Other places have done it. They haven’t turned out too good. Abolish completely the death penalty. And I know there’s a lot of debate on the death penalty and that has been for a long time, but sometimes you use the death penalty depending on the crime. You know what happened today with regard to the death penalty. Appoint social justice prosecutors in order to free violent criminals. So they want to appoint social justice prosecutors to free violent criminals. End mandatory minimums. And that’s by empowering judges to determine appropriate sentences by fighting to repeal mandatory minimums at the federal level and give states incentives to repeal their mandatory minimums. We could go on for days. Incentivize prison closure. So they want to close our prisons. They want to abolish our police departments. They want to abolish our prisons, I guess. Incentivize jail and prison closures as populations decline. Ensure the resources saved are invested directly into those communities. So they want to close them rather than have them for some very bad people, people that are not going to behave when they get out. You see that in New York. They allowed a lot of criminals out and those criminals are causing havoc. And then they got rid of their incredible and legendary crime squad and bad things are happening in New York. Bad things are happening. I love New York. I hate to see what’s going on. End solitary confinement. Free federal housing for former inmates. So federal housing now can go to inmates, former inmates. Rejoined Paris climate accord, and seek an even higher level of restrictions. Oh, I didn’t notice that. Oh, I see. So they want to rejoin the Paris climate accord and they want to seek an even higher level of [inaudible 00:42:09]. In other words, make it worse than it was. Mandate net zero carbon emissions for homes, offices, and all new buildings by 2030, that basically means no windows, no nothing. It’s very hard to do. I tell people when they want to go into some of these buildings, “How are your eyes? Because they won’t be good in five years.” And I hope you don’t mind cold office space in the winter and warm office space in the summer, because your air conditioning is not the same as the good old days. Mandate zero carbon emissions from power plants by 2035. Zero, we’re talking about zero. Nothing can go in the air. Mandate net zero carbon emissions by 2050. And I believe he’s changing that. He’s bringing it down. He wants no petroleum product. He wants no oil or gas. I don’t think Texas is going to do too well. They’re going to get rid of about 7 million jobs if you go by the Biden plan. I don’t think that Oklahoma, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, you’re going to be too happy with that, and many other states, Ohio. Mandate all 500,000 school buses and all three million government vehicles be changed to zero emission vehicles within five years. I’ve heard of worse than that. Install 500,000 taxpayer funded charging stations nationwide. Here’s a bad one, really bad one. End school choice. There is nothing that the African American community wants more than school choice, and mothers and fathers are going to be very happy to see him be defeated just on that alone. End school choice. So Joe Biden wants to end school choice. End tax credit scholarship serving disadvantaged students in 26 states. Oppose 14 million Americans with education savings accounts and get rid of school choice, having to do with school choice. Eliminate school choice in Washington, D.C. You know what they’ve done in Washington. They have some incredible example right here, example. I know of one example. I think they have a number of them, but one is incredible. Abolish all charter schools. Charter schools are doing great. Ban funding for charter schools in poor neighborhoods. We don’t want charter schools in poor neighborhoods. Well, that’s not fair. Abolish educational standards. Abolish, in the suburbs, you’re going to abolish the suburbs with this, and force Obama/Biden’s radical AFFH, that’s the AFFH regulation that threatens to strip localities of federal affordable housing funds or less unless they changed their zoning laws to fit the federal government’s demands. So what you have, I mean, I’ve been watching this for years in Westchester, coming from New York. They want a low income housing built in a neighborhood. Well, I’m ending that rule. I’m taking it out. So I had spoke with Ben Carson the other day. We’re going to be taking it out. I’ve watched that whole thing go, and now they want to make it twice as bad in the suburbs, ib the suburbs. Mothers aren’t happy about that. Fathers aren’t happy about that. They worked hard to buy a house and now they’re going to watch the housing values drop like a rock. And that has happened. Drop like a rock. So we’re not going to do that. We’re going to do the exact opposite. Probably there has never been a time, and this is just a few. It’s much worse than that. We did this very quickly. There’s probably never been a time when candidates are so different. We want law and order. They don’t want law and order. We want strong, closed borders with people able to come in through merit, through a legal process. They don’t want to have any borders at all. They’re going to rip down the wall. It was hard to get that built. And now it’s almost completed. It’ll be completed by a little after the end of the year. They want to rip it down and it’s had such an impact. It’s incredible. It stops trafficking, human trafficking of women and children, but women mostly. Human trafficking, one of the worst things ever, all at a that it’s never been at because of the internet. You think of it as an ancient statement. You wouldn’t think that’s possible today, but it’s human trafficking of women and children. And they want to let that continue. The wall has stopped it so much because they will go over to a section where there aren’t people, not an entry point, and they’ll make a left into the United States and they’re on their way. They can’t do that anymore. We have a 30 foot wall that goes six feet into the ground, stops a lot of the tunneling, because they’re pretty good at tunnels. But we watch the tunnels and we have equipment for that. You can’t make a left anymore and come into the United States loaded up with human traffic. So they want to take down the wall. They want to have open borders. Think of open borders today though with the pandemic. I mean, the timing is sort of interesting, but with the pandemic. So there’s never been a time when too candidates were so different. I mean, I’ve seen races where it’s like the same exact platforms. I’m even talking about essentially Democrat, Republican, there’s not that much difference. There’s a little difference, but there’s not much. You choose one because you like the way they look, you like the way they sound. You like the way they talk. You like something about one, and you don’t like the other, but there have never been a difference. Here’s one of the greatest ever. This is without question the single biggest difference. If you want law and order, for instance, I enacted recently when I saw what was going on with federal monuments, we don’t have the right to do states, although we’re trying to find it. But with the monuments, where they wanted to rip down Andrew Jackson. They wanted to rip down George Washington. They were actually heading over to the Jefferson Memorial, if you can believe that. But this has been going on, and I found an act that we’ve used and we have many, many people in jail right now. Many, many people in jail, all over the country, because they tried to destroy or in some cases got it down, a federal statue or monument. We haven’t had anybody making a move since I enacted this. I signed an executive order a couple of weeks ago, and it says very simply, “10 years in jail. You do it, 10 years in jail.” The amazing part is we’re able to catch everybody, because thanks to all of you on television, we appreciate it. But we have their pictures, they have the man standing on Andrew Jackson’s horse. We have the man standing by General George Washington. We have everybody standing… and oh, they were going to go for the Emancipation Proclamation, Abraham Lincoln, standing with a young man who is being freed. And we said, “We’re going to do something. We can’t let this happen.” Now, it could be removed at some point. You go through a process, a legal process, go through Congress, whatever. I understand that. At the same time, some people like these statues and monuments, but it can be removed, but you have to go through a legal process. So they were going to have 20-25,000 people that night, nobody showed up. Nobody. You know that, because you were disappointed to see that. The next night, I believe 22 people showed up. They said, “We’re going to make it Friday night instead,” and 22 people showed up. Four were actually arrested, because we have pictures of them knocking down other statues, so they’re in jail now. So there has never been an election where we’ve had this kind of difference. We want strong borders, without borders, you’ve heard me say it a thousand times. Without borders, you don’t have a country. They don’t want to have borders. They want to have open borders. It’s radical left and it’ll destroy our country. 20 years ago, Venezuela was a very rich country, one of the richest. One of the richest anywhere, per capita one of the richest. Tremendous oil reserves. Now they don’t have water, they don’t have food, they don’t have medicine. We do everything we can to take care of the people, but they have nothing. And that’s exactly the ideology that you have going over here. If I wasn’t there to stop it, if I wasn’t here to say, “No way, that’s not going to happen,” we’d be in some mess. We’d be in some mess, and Pelosi and Schumer and Bernie and Joe, they’ll never stop it. They don’t have the power, the strength to stop it. It’s beyond them, but we do. So there’s never been a time like this, where you’ve had an election of people so different. Okay, couple of questions? Yeah, please. Go ahead. No, I don’t. I think we have really good poll numbers. They’re not suppression polls, they’re real polls. You look at the intercostal in Florida, you look at the Lakes, you see thousands of boats with Trump signs, American signs, you’ve got the Trump Pence sign all over. You look at what’s going on, you look at bikers for miles and miles riding up highways proudly with their signs. We won a race where it was the same thing, 2016. We had polls that were fake. They turned out to be fake. Not all, a couple of them got it right. Three of them, to be exact. Three of them. One of them was unsuspecting, but they got it right. They were very proud of it. But we had in 2016 something even more so, but we got in and we had 306 to I guess, 223, which was a tremendous margin of difference. You remember, they all said, “He cannot get to 270.” I went to Maine a number of times, where we just freed up lobster fishing and fishing. They took away 5,000 square miles from Maine. I just opened it up and I just got rid of tariffs in China. And we’re working on European Union, which charge our fishermen tariffs, and I said, “You’re not going to do that.” So we freed it up for Maine, but if you take a look, we went up there recently. There were crowds; thousands of people lined up going over to a factory where we were opening up for… We’re making swabs. A beautiful big, new factory making swabs. I think that the enthusiasm now is greater and maybe far greater than it was in 2016. I think a lot of people don’t want to talk about it. I think they’re not going to say, “Hey, I’m for Trump, I’m for Trump,” they don’t want to go through the process. And I fully understand that, because the process is not fair. The media doesn’t treat us fairly. They never have, and perhaps they never will. But maybe they will when we turn this around for a second term, and it’s going to happen very quickly. When we turn it around for a second time, maybe they will. I think we’re doing very well in the polls, and I think you have a silent majority the likes of which this country has never seen before. This is a very important election. We’ve done a great job. We had to turn it off, as I said. Turn it off, and now we’ve started it again. As you know, they announced two weeks ago record job numbers, almost five million people. And that beat the last month, which was also a record, 2.8 million people. Nobody’s ever done what we’ve done, and now we’re doing it twice. I think by election day, you’re going to see some incredible numbers. The third quarter is going to be really good. Fourth quarter’s going to be great, but next year’s going to be one of the best economic years. So, hopefully I’ll be able to be the President where we say, “Look at the great job I did.” I think great. I think we have a great chance. I think we’re going to have a lot of people show up. I’m very worried about mail-in voting because I think it’s subject to tremendous fraud and being rigged. Do you see that Paterson, New Jersey, where I believe it was 20% of the vote was fraudulent? It was all sorts of things happened. I understand a mailman was recently indicted someplace for playing games with the mail-in ballots. You’ll have tremendous fraud if you do these mail-in ballots. Now, absentee ballots are okay, because absentee ballots, you have to get applications. You have to go through a process. If I’m here, and I vote in Florida, you get an absentee ballot. But you have to go through a process. Absentee ballots are great, but mail-in voting, where a governor mails millions of ballots to people all over the state. California, millions and millions of ballots, as an [inaudible 00:56:15]… and then they come back, they don’t come back. Who got them? Did you forget to send them to a Republican area or a Democrat area, I guess you could say? But if you take a look at all of the unbelievable fraud that’s been involved with mail-in voting over the last even short period of a while, but look at Paterson, New Jersey. It was a massive error and a massive miscalculation and there was incredible fraud. Look at the city council, what’s happened to it. This is one place, but you have many places and they’re all over. Yes, please? No, I haven’t spoken to him. No, I don’t. I have no plan to speak to him. Yeah, please. Go. Yeah, go ahead. No, I wish her the best. I hope she’s better. I didn’t hear that, actually. She was just hospitalized? No, that’s too bad. No, I wish her the best. She’s actually giving me some good rulings. Okay? So, you know that, right? People are surprised. No, I wish her the absolute best. Please. We banned for Europe, and at some point, that’ll come off. And we’re dealing with them all the time. The relationship’s very good, they just don’t treat us very well on trade. They have been very unfair to us over many, many decades. We’re doing that. It’s very easy to solve. I was all set to solve it, actually, and then we got hit with the plague. But we have a travel ban on various countries, and that travel ban remains until such time as we say it doesn’t remain. We want our country safe. Unlike Biden, we don’t want to have criminals pouring into our country. We don’t want to have open borders. We’re not going to have that, and we want to take care of our police. We want to actually fund our police, not defund them. We’re not going to abolish our police and we’re not going to make our military small and weak because probably or at least at top of the level, we need our military right now. Yeah, go ahead please. Okay, look, my policy’s America First. We’ve lost hundreds of billions of dollars a year with China and many other countries. What we’re doing is just handing everybody everything. It’s just sad. I’ve watched it, I’ve looked at it. We did the US Mexico, you saw that? USMCA? We made a very fair deal on trade. We had the worst deal ever. Right, you know that? We had the worst deal ever, and it replaced that. It replaced that horrible NAFTA deal that was one of the worst trade deals ever made. I’ll tell you, the only deal that might be worse is the WTO, World Trade Organization. Maybe worse. OAN, please? It's true. Meaning, not to invest? That's correct. Yes. Yes, and you’ll see more coming. This was a very important bill that we signed, but you’re going to see more coming over the next short period of time. But yes, we don’t want them investing in Chinese military companies, okay? Well, you got a lot of actions we can take, including the increase. Right now, people don’t know, China’s paying a lot of tariffs. We made a China deal, and they bought just I think the third highest amount of corn ever in world history, they just bought from us. The highest amount, which is great for our farmers, but I view it differently than I did before I made the deal. When I made the deal, I thought this was a great deal. After what happened to us, what happened to the world coming from China, I view it much differently. But we can impose massive tariffs on China if we want, and other countries, if we want. And we’ll see. We just want to be treated fairly. We want a level playing field. Our farmers were never treated properly by anybody, and they were targeted by China. I paid our farmers $28 billion over a two-year period, because they were targeted to that amount of money, to that exact amount of money. $28. They were $16 billion, and it was $12 billion, $28 over a two-year period, and we gave $28 billion to our farmers. That’s why they’re all here, and now they’re doing very well. Our farmers are doing very well, because we made really great trade deals. USMCA just kicked in. The China deal, they’re buying a lot. They are buying a lot, we’ll say that. They’re buying a lot. A lot of people ask, “How are they doing on the trade deal?” They’re buying a lot. So I want to thank everybody, and we’ll be having these conferences. Again, we’re going to be signing an immigration act very soon. It’s going to be based on merit. It’s going to be very strong. We’re going to work on DACA, because we want to make people happy. And I’ll tell you, even conservative Republicans want to see something happen with DACA. The Democrats had their chance for three years to do something with DACA, and they always turned it down. They always turned it down. They used it as politics. I’m using it to get something done, but we’ll be signing a very powerful immigration act. It’ll be great. It’ll be merit-based. The country’s tried to get it for 25 or 30 years. It’ll be strong on the border, but you’ll come in legally and you’ll be able to come in legally, and very importantly, we’ll be taking care of people from DACA in a very Republican way. Republicans, I’ve spoken to many Republicans, and some would like to leave it out. But really, they understand that it’s the right thing to do, so we’re going to be taking care of DACA. We will be doing for DACA what the Democrats had a chance to do and they never did it. Okay? Thank you all very much.

"12","07-15-20","In the last three years ICE has deported over 16,000 gang members and arrested over 2000 members of MS-13. Think of those numbers, 16,000 and arrested over 2000 members of MS-13. We’ve also deported a lot of the MS-13s out of our country. This week’s actions by the Joint Task Force, Vulcan, is the most recent offense to… really this has been a big offensive in my administration’s war on foreign gangs of which we came into this administration and we said, “What’s going on?” We had gangs from countries that you wouldn’t believe. More than 20 of the criminals we indicted and arrested in the past seven days were illegal aliens. Yesterday for the first time ever the Eastern District of Virginia, thank you very much, indicted MS-13 leaders on charges of terrorism. Well, so we have the leader on charges of terrorism. And that’s a first, is that correct? … for using terrorism, which gives us extra strength. In New York and Nevada 21 MS-13 members and leaders have been indicted on charges including murder, kidnapping, and drug trafficking. The DOJ has also announced that it will seek the death penalty for a bloodthirsty MS-13 leader responsible for the despicable killing of seven Americans, including two teenage girls. Over the past few days, the DOJ and DHS have made several arrests at high, high levels in these cases including several immigration arrests. And I want to thank Chad Wolf for working along with the FBI and with the Attorney General. They’ve work very closely together at the border and the border as you know is setting new records for allowing people in that aren’t allowed to come in, allowing people in illegally. We believe the monsters who murder children should be put to death. We seem to have quite a good agreement on that. These people murder children and they do it as slowly and viciously as possible. We will not allow these animals to terrorize our communities and my administration will not rest until every member of MS-13 is brought to justice. We’ve done a great job with MS-13 but now we’re stepping it up even to a higher level. This has never happened before, there’s never been any move like this before. Much of it has already taken place, otherwise we wouldn’t be talking about it. When Biden and the radical left want to open borders for MS-13 and others, we want strong borders, we want as I’ve said, we want borders. Without borders you don’t have a country and we have a great country and it’s coming back stronger than ever from job numbers to every other number, it’s coming back stronger than ever before. We’re going to have a great third quarter, we’re going to have a great fourth quarter and next year is going to be one of the strongest years economically we’ve ever had. I’m going ask AG Barr, say a few words about the MS-13 and what we’ve done, and what we’re doing, and where we plan to go. And next week we’re going to have I think a very exciting news conference because we’re going to be talking about some of these cities where the Democrats running them have just lost control of the city, so that’ll be very interesting. Bill, please. In past administrations El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala did not cooperate with the United States at all, they wouldn’t let us bring people back. And under this administration a long time ago, almost my… I would say my second or third day I said, “That’s not going to work.” They’d bring them back and they’d say, “Get them out of here, we’re not taking them.” And they don’t say that anymore. They don’t even come close to say that anymore. The operation is going to be very good. This is probably the meanest worst gang anywhere in the world, the MS-13 group. And a big dent is put in them, it took place over the last few days and really over the last year, heavy focus on MS-13. They’re an evil group of people. They’re sick, they’re deranged and we’re taking care of it. And I want to just thank these great crime fighters that are with us today. Thank you. It's like Central Casting. We forgot one person. Good luck, good luck. That’s really good, it’s so important. It’s like Central Casting. People are like Central Casting and you’re going to do a great job and we appreciate it. And we will be meeting you in a similar vein, but a little different subject next week. And that concerns our cities and again, people that have lost control of some of our great cities, we’re going to straighten things out. Thank you all very much, thank you. You’ll be seeing next week. We’ll have a conference next week and we’ll tell you in great detail but it’s something that I think at this point the American people want to see. They’ve been run very poorly, these cities, whether it’s Seattle, where we were getting ready to go in and they decided to go in and that’s good. Minneapolis, where we had the National Guard go in, and as soon as they did that we straightened that mess out. They should have been able to do it locally with their police. Their police are good, they were told not to do anything. Or many other cases, we’re doing a great job in Portland. Portland was very rough and they called us in and we did a good job to put it mildly, many people in jail right now. But we have other cities that are out of control, they’re like more zones. And if the city isn’t going to straighten it out of local politicians, or in this case, I don’t say this for political reasons, they’re all Democrats, they’re liberal, left wing Democrats. And it’s almost like they think this is going to be this way forever, where in Chicago 68 people were shot and 18 died last week. We’re not going to put up with that, we’re not going to put up with that. That’s a for our next discussion. Thank you all very much. [crosstalk 00:11:12]. I get along very well with Dr. Fauci. I get along very well with Dr. Fauci. [crosstalk 00:11:16]. I have a very good relationship, well, that spit never… but I have a very good relationship with Dr. Fauci. Thank you very much.

"13","07-16-20","Hello everybody, thank you. Thank you very much everybody. Please. That’s a nice crowd on a nice cool day. It’s beautiful though. Might be hot but it’s beautiful. We’re here today to celebrate and expand our historic campaign to rescue American workers from job-killing regulations. Before I came into office, American workers were smothered by merciless avalanche of wasteful and expensive and intrusive federal regulation. These oppressive burdensome mandates were a stealth tax on our people, slashing take home pay, suppressing innovation, surging the cost of goods, and shipping millions of American jobs overseas. Millions and millions and millions, it never ended. Nearly four years ago, we ended this regulatory assault on the American worker and we launched the most dramatic regulatory relief campaign in American history by far. No other administration has done anywhere near. Thank you. At the heart of this effort was a revolutionary promise, for every one new regulation issued, we pledged that two federal regulations would be permanently removed. We not only met that ambitious goal which at the time people said was impossible, we vastly exceeded it. For every one new regulation added, nearly eight federal regulations have been terminated. Been an incredible achievement. As you can see behind me, we have removed the gigantic regulatory burden Americans have forced to carry for decades, freeing our citizens to reach their highest potential. Our historic regulatory relief is providing the average American household an extra $3,100.00 every single year and we’re going up from that number. We’re going up from that number. Think of that. $3,100.00 per household. Joining us today is Vice President Mike Pence. Thank you Mike. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Wilbur, thank you very much. Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia, thank you, thank you [inaudible 00:02:43]. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. Thank you Alex. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao. Thank you Elaine. We had a great day in Georgia yesterday, cutting regulations like nobody’s ever seen before. EPA administrator Andrew Wheeler, thank you Andrew, thank you very much. OMB acting director Russ Vought, thank you Russ, and Small Business administrator, I love her name, Jovita Carranza. Jovita, thank you, thank you, and CMS administrator Seema Verma, thank you Seema. Great people. Those are great people, they’re doing an incredible job. I also want to thank the many state and local, tribal leaders who join us in this great cause. Thank you very much and thank you for being here. We appreciate it. Thank you all very much. What we have achieved together is truly without precedent, never happened before. The previous administration added over 16,000 pages of heavy-handed regulations to the federal register. That’s why nothing got done. Under my administration, we have removed nearly 25,000 pages of job-destroying regulations, more than any other president by far in the history of our country, whether it was four years, eight years, or in one case, more than eight years. The prior administration piled up more than 600 major new regulations, a cruel and punishing regulatory burden that cost the average American an additional $2,300.00 per year. Think of that, the average American $ 2,300.00 regulation, hitting low-income Americans by far the hardest. These regulations also inflicted a steep economic toll on African-American communities. By contrast our reforms are putting more money into the pockets of hardworking Americans. In addition to saving every family more than $3,000.00 per year, my administration has just issued another reform that my council of economic advisors estimates will lower the price of new vehicles by more than $2,200.00 per vehicle and I think we’re going to get that up to $3,500.00 per vehicle. It’s very exciting, and by the way, the vehicles will be better, they’ll be stronger, and they’ll be safer. Our regulation cuts are also delivering massive savings on broadband internet services and some home energy bills will be really historically cut. It’s actually amazing, as well as historically low gasoline prices. Gasoline prices, you look today, I think it was $1.99. At the same time, we saved our oil companies. We are now the largest since we’ve been here, the largest energy source in the world. Nobody’s even close so it’s great but we saved them. They had a hard time a number of months ago and frankly for a long time but we’ve saved them. $1.99 they were telling me, in some cases lower than that. We’re bringing back consumer choice in home appliances so that you can buy washers and dryers, shower heads and faucets. So shower heads, you take a shower, the water doesn’t come out. You want to wash your hands, the water doesn’t come out. So what do you do? You just stand there longer, you take a shower longer. Because my hair, I don’t know about you, but it has to be perfect. Perfect. Dishwashers, you didn’t have any water so the people that do the dishes, you press it and it goes again and you do it again and again. So you might as well give them the water because you’ll end up using less water. So we made it so dishwashers now have a lot more water and in many places, in most places of the country, water is not a problem. They don’t know what to do with it. It’s called rain. They don’t have a problem. And old-fashioned, incandescent light bulbs, I brought them back, I brought them back. They have two nice qualities, they’re cheaper and they’re better. They look better, they make you look so much better, that’s important to all of us, but they’re better and much cheaper and they were mandated out, legislated out, and we brought them back and they’re selling like hot cakes. We stopped the egregious abuse of the Clean Water Act which extreme activists have used to shut down construction projects all across our country. When I signed that legislation I had many farmers and construction people standing behind me. People that haven’t cried since they were babies, some of them never even when they were a baby and they were crying. Many people were crying. We gave them back their life. They took away their land, they took away their rights, they took away their life. By reigning in EPA overreach, my administration has returned the agency to its core mission of insuring clean air, clean water, and a truly pristine natural environment. Our air now and our water is as clean as it’s been in the last four decades. Yesterday our country achieved yet another groundbreaking milestone by completing a sweeping overhaul of America’s badly broken infrastructure approval process. It was totally out of control. Instead of taking up to 20 years to approve a major project, we’re cutting the federal permitting timeline, it’s already been done, to a maximum of two years or less, in some cases even less than one year. It’s possible that it won’t qualify, it’s possible that it won’t be good environmentally or safety-wise, in which case at least in a period of a year or two, we’ll raise the hand and you won’t make it, but most projects will make it but you won’t go for 10, 15, 18 or 20 years. There are many horror stories that we could relate. We’re reclaiming America’s proud heritage as a nation of builders. My administration has also eliminated massive regulatory barriers. In our battle against the China virus, these actions saved countless lives, speeding up the production of equipment. That means ventilators like nobody’s ever seen before. Probably the greatest source of manufacturing, the greatest achievement since World War II. We’re now making ventilators for countries all over the world. Medicine, accelerating the delivery of life-saving treatments and ensuring that we will have a vaccine in a record time. We’re doing fantastically well on that. That will be for another time, another meeting, but we are doing on therapeutics and vaccines incredibly well. No administration in history has removed more red tape more quickly to rescue the economy and to protect the health of our people. When you think of it, we are all set up, that as we get the vaccine or therapeutic, and we’re set up militarily, we’re going to be delivering it in record time. It’s all set to move. We put an investment upfront and we have logistical people, generals, great people. They’re going to be delivering this all over the country as soon as we have it and we’ve made tremendous progress, you’ve been reading about it. In total we’ve taken more than 740 actions to suspend regulations that would have slowed our response to the China virus. This includes lifting restrictions on manufacturers so that our great auto workers could produce more than 100,000 ventilators so we’ve done over 100,000 in 100 days. Think of that, and we didn’t have ventilators, we weren’t set up for ventilators. We became a country that’s making a lot of them. Helping so many others. Countries that are never going to be in a position to make them. They’re complex, they’re expensive, they’re big. Very, very, very tough to do and we’ve saved a lot of lives. There’s never been a person in our country, even though we started with almost nothing, I say the cupboard was bare when we took over, we started with nothing. There’s never been a person in our country, even though we had just absolutely … We were going on empty, never been one person that needed a ventilator that didn’t get it. Think of that. Not one person, as complex as they are, as big, as expensive. Take a long time to get them done. Not one person has ever needed a ventilator that didn’t get it. We made telemedicine, thank you. Great job. Great … Really a great job. The people here, they get no credit for it. I don’t want any credit, they should get the credit, but they get no credit, but we’ve done a great job helping so many other countries now. We made telemedicine available to all American patients, and allowed doctors to work across state lines. I will tell you, the telemedicine is something that’s really gone up by thousands, and thousands of percentage points, of percent, because what happened is, people that wouldn’t even think of using telemedicine all of a sudden started using it, and it’s really turned out to be good. Really, really turned out to be good, and it solved a lot of problems, so that’s something that’s been great advancement. Furthermore, I’ve ordered federal agencies to look for ways to make these healthcare reforms totally permanent. Vice President Pence is also working closely with state, local, and tribal leaders to streamline occupational licensing. Over 30 states have taken steps to reduce these barriers to unemployment, and to employment, and including a state that I love very much. I have a little history in that state, the great state of Alaska. Thank you very much, governor, for being here, Mike Dunleavy. Mike, thank you very much. In Idaho, governor Brad Little who is here today with us as well set a new record for regulatory relief. Good job, Brad. Good, good governor, great governor. Two great governors. The American people know best how to run their own lives. They don’t need Washington bureaucrats controlling their every move and micromanaging their every decision. With each regulation we cut, we’re not only returning the money, and the power to our citizens, we are draining the Washington swamp, and they’re not happy about it. I can tell you that. I think you know that. The swamp was deep. I just didn’t know how deep, deeper than I thought. Joining us today are a few of the countless Americans who are personally benefiting from our pro-worker reforms. Joe Cambria owns Cambria Truck Center in New Jersey, good state, New Jersey, and it’s been really something that he’s seen firsthand, how our regulation cuts have helped create thousands and thousands of jobs. Joe, please come up, and say a few words. Thank you, Joe. Thank you very much. Thank you. Good job, good job. That was easy. Wasn’t it? Thank you very much, great job. Dr. Amy Johnson is a nurse practitioner in rural Virginia. Amy, please come up and share with us how important expanded health care and telehealth has been for you, and your patients. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, great job, thank you. So, that’s been a great help to you, telehealth, it’s been an incredible thing. Great job. Thank you very much. Jim Shelton is a rancher from Arizona who was crushed by the Obama, Biden administration’s ridiculous Waters of the United States rule. It’s been a catastrophic rule, but it’s gone now, which gave bureaucrats power to regulate every puddle on private land or a lake. Jim, please come up, and tell us of your experience, which I know wasn’t a good one, but it’s a good one now, please. Thank you Jim. Thank you very much, thank you Jim. That was my honor Jim, and thank you very much. It’s terrible, that you had to suffer for so long, and they took your property away from you, and you want to take care of your property better than any government is going to tell you to take care of your property. You’ll take care of it better, so we don’t have to worry about that. Thank you very much, beautifully said, thank you. I want to just, as president say that I will always fight to defend your rights, and your freedoms. I Will fight very hard for your rights, and your freedoms. The [inaudible 00:22:12] wants to reverse these extraordinary gains and reimpose these disasters regulations. They want to take what we’ve taken off, Jim, and they want to put them back on, and I guess they can do that. You’ll fight him for a little while, but eventually, you’ll lose, and they want to bury our economy under suffocating, relentless landslides of Washington red tape, like we had before I got here. We must never return to the days of soul crushing regulation that ravaged our cities, devastated our workers, drained our vitality right out of our people, and thoroughly crippled our nation’s prized competitive edge. It’s what we have. We have great, great people. The greatest people in the world. Our entire economy, and our very way of life are threatened by Biden’s plans to transform our nation, and subjugate our communities through the blunt force instrument of federal regulation at a level that you haven’t even seen yet. Do you think that was bad? You haven’t even seen it yet. They want to go many times what they put you under in the past. Under the Unity platform, Joe Biden published with socialist Bernie Sanders, they are proposing, and this is all in writing. It’s done. They agreed. They are proposing to reenter the job killing unfair Paris Climate Accord, which will cost our country trillions of dollars, trillions and trillions of dollars, and put us in a very, very bad competitive position relative to the world. Not surprising to you, China will be greatly advanced under this ridiculous agreement, so will Russia, so will many other countries. They proposed to mandate net zero emissions from all new homes and buildings, skyrocketing the cost of construction and putting the goal of home ownership out of reach for millions. Destroying the look of the home, the beauty of the home, I’m somebody that’s built many homes, many buildings. If you take a look at this, it doesn’t look good. You still have to sell, right? You still have to sell, but they’ve put it out of reach from a cost standpoint, totally out of reach. It’s not practical, it’s not good and it doesn’t work. They want to eliminate carbon from the US energy industry, which means abolishing all American oil, clean coal and natural gas. No coal, no gas, no oil, nothing to fire our massive plants. The result of this federally mandated shut down would be the wholesale destruction of the entire energy industry and many other industries, the economic evisceration of entire communities and the unfettered offshoring of millions of our best jobs to foreign countries and foreign polluters. Millions and millions of jobs would go, thousands and thousands of countries would be at a level that you’ve never seen. Companies would be disappearing, left, and right, just like they did with NAFTA, which we terminated for the USMCA, which is another beauty that we’ve done, not for now, but another great beauty. But thousands of companies, plants, factories would be closed. Under this dismal future energy would be unaffordable for the vast majority of Americans and the American dream would be sniffed out so quickly and replaced with a socialist disaster. The Democrats in DC have been in one, two at a much higher level abolish our beautiful and successful suburbs by placing far left Washington bureaucrats in charge of local zoning decisions. They’re absolutely determined to eliminate single family zoning, to destroy the value of houses and communities already built, just as they have in Minneapolis and other locations that you read about today. Your home will go down in value and crime rates will rapidly rise. Joe Biden and his bosses from the radical left, want to significantly multiply what they’re doing now. And what will be the end result is you will totally destroy the beautiful suburbs. Suburbia will be no longer as we know it. So they want to defund and abolish your police and law enforcement, while at same time destroying our great suburbs. The suburb destruction will end with us. Next week, I will be discussing the AFFH rule, AFFH rule, a disaster. And our plans to protect the suburbs from being obliterated by Washington Democrats, by people on the far left that want to see the suburbs destroyed that don’t care. People have worked all their lives to get into a community and now they’re going to watch it go to hell, not going to happen, not while I’m here. The Biden/Bernie plan would also use the weapon of federal regulation to tie the hands of our police departments by abolishing cash bail, think of that. Think of that bail, no problem, they killed somebody let them out. Take a look at what’s happening, crime in New York City up 368% from just a short while ago. They got rid of a lot of police and they’re in the process of doing it, a billion dollars. They probably want to abolish… it’s not even believable. When I first heard about it, when you first heard about it, you didn’t think it was real, you didn’t think it was believable. Just like the Green New Deal, how crazy is that? But they’re actually trying to put it into play, it’ll mean the end of this country. So by getting rid of bail, they are incentivizing jail and prison closures. They want to get rid of prisons, they don’t think anybody should go to prison. Setting loose violent criminals, appointing left-wing social justice prosecutors, like you have in Philadelphia, where people creating and doing the most criminal of acts are let go in many cases immediately and making our wonderful cops, our great, great police, cops, subordinate to distant bureaucrats who have never spent a day in their lives fighting crime. Unlike the socialists, we believe in the rule of the people, not the rule of the unelected bureaucrats that don’t know what they’re doing. We believe in the dignity of the individual, not the iron grip of the state. Our regulatory reforms are vital, not only to the success of our economy but the strength of our democracy and the survival of Liberty itself. My administration will continue pressing forward until we have made every last vestige of Washington fully, completely, and totally accountable to the citizens of the United States. We are putting our faith in the workers who power our country, the doctors who care for our country, the truckers who sustain our country and the farmers and ranchers who preserve our country in all of its majestic beauty. The American people are the ones who made our nation great and together we will make it greater by far than ever before. God bless you and God bless America. Thank you very much for being with us. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. We must have said something right, I guess we said it absolutely right. It’s about our country, it’s about our country. We want to be strong. We want to respect everybody, but we have to have strong law enforcement and that’s taking place in the areas that we’re responsible for. We want others to call us for help, there’s nothing wrong. Let Chicago call, let Seattle call, we where going into Seattle, all set to go and then they did it themselves. They heard we were coming in and the hands went up, they gave up. And it’s so terrible when you see what’s happening. Minneapolis, we said, “Get the Guard in there.” Three nights, “Get the Guard in, get the guard.” We got the Guard in. The National Guard, they’ve done a fantastic job. As soon as they showed up, it was like a knife cutting through butter. You saw that, right? After four days of horror, it wasn’t the police’s fault in any of these places, they were told to leave. The police are, generally speaking, they do a great job. They were told to leave, but you so what happened. Minneapolis, grab your gun and run. That’s not what they wanted to do. But the National Guard came in and we did a great job. No problem, after that, did you notice? We just passed a Statues and Monument executive order and they were going well, now you see that beautiful… Look at it right there it’s so beautiful, the Washington Monument. If they had their choice they’d take it down, and I guarantee you they’d rename it. They want to rename it, they want George Washington out. They won Thomas Jefferson out. They want Abraham Lincoln out. They want abolitionists out. They don’t know what they want, they just want to destroy our country. We’re not going to let it happen, we’re not letting it happen. So I’d now like to ask Vice President Mike Pence to say a few words. Thank you, Mike. Thank you. Thank you very much, Brad. Thank you. Thank you, Brad. You are. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Mike. Thank you. We have many exciting things that we’ll be announcing over the next eight weeks I would say. Things that nobody has even contemplated, thought about, thought possible and things that we’re going to get done and we have gotten done. We’ve started in most cases, but it’s going to be a very exciting eight weeks. A eight weeks, I think Mike, we can honestly say nobody’s ever going to see eight weeks like we’re going to have, because we really have. We’re taking on immigration, taking on education, we’re taking on so many aspects of things that people were hopelessly tied up in knots in Congress. They’ve been working on some of these things for 25, 30 years, wasn’t happening. But you’ll see levels of detail and you’ll see levels of thought that a lot of people believed very strongly we didn’t have in this country. We’re going to get things done. We’re going to get things done that they’ve wanted to see done for a long, long time. I think we’ll start sometime on Tuesday. We’ll be discussing our one plan on suburbia, but that’s one of many, many different plans. Then we’re going into the immigration, the world of immigration. The world of education. We’re going into the world of healthcare, very complete healthcare. And we have a lot of very exciting things to discuss, but cutting of regulation has been really something that I felt we could do and we could do fairly easily. Nothing’s easy in this country. We had statutory requirements where we’d do phase one and then we’d have to wait 90 days, we’d do phase two and we’d have to wait 60 days. We do phase three and we said, let’s do phase four, “Sir, I’m sorry, you have to wait one year.” But we were able to do things that nobody has ever been able to do or even close on deregulation. And these trucks, this really is a great, a great little example. I don’t know who thought of this idea, but it’s actually quite simple and quite good. Is that Brooke? Quite simple and quite good. I don’t love having that big sucker hanging over my head. I want to get out of here as fast as possible, but I do want to thank you all incredible people. You’ve done an incredible job. And to the speakers, please. Thank you very much. Great job. Thank you very much. Thank you everybody. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Brad.
















"
"14","07-20-20","Just to see what’s going at our meetings. So I figured let you come in, you’ll look and you’ll see, we have a lot of good things happening. We have tremendous progress on vaccines and therapeutics. We’re getting reports, we’re studying the reports very closely. I think people are going to be very pleasantly surprised with what’s going on the vaccine front and the therapeutic front. This is always the first topic. Secondarily, but very importantly, we’re working and negotiating with the Democrats on trying to get a plan that helps small businesses, helps people, helps this country, and I think we’ve made a lot of progress on that. And the discussions are going on. Steve, do you want to say a few words as to where we are. Okay. Mike? Okay. Mitch. Kevin? It came from China. It should have never been allowed to get out. They could have stopped it. They could have stopped it easily. They chose not to. And we’ll have further reports on that. But, it came from China. They could have stopped it, they didn’t. They stopped it from going into China, but they didn’t stop him from going to the rest of the world. It didn’t stop it from going to Europe, to us. They should have stopped it. They could’ve stopped it. They weren’t transparent at all. They were the opposite. It’s not good. I spoke with the president of France this morning and I spoke with the president of Egypt. And we had a very, very good conversation, both of us, and all of us and all of us together. I had many conversations with leaders all over the world over the weekend and over the last couple of weeks in particular, and this is a pandemic that is flaring up all over the place. Countries said they were in good shape, and then all of a sudden, they have big flare up. I see that over the weekend, I guess on Friday, there was a record worldwide number of death, worldwide. Because when you watch the news, the local news, and you see it, it’s all about the United States. They never like to talk about what’s going on in the world. But you look at Mexico, Brazil, many countries in Europe, all over Russia, Russia’s got a tremendous problem. What’s going on is terrible. It’s terrible. This is a worldwide problem. We’re helping the world with ventilators. We’re helping a lot of countries. They don’t have ventilators and we’re sending thousands of ventilators to different countries. But, I do want people to understand this is a worldwide problem caused by China, but it’s a worldwide problem. Countries are going through hell. We’re going to give you a lot of briefings in the next week and over the next few weeks as to, I think it’s very important to do it, the vaccines and the therapeutics. I think I’m going to bring some of the great companies that are working, and very successfully in the past, have worked on these things. And they’re going to tell you very specifically what they’re doing and how they’re doing, We think we’re doing very well in that regard. Those two items. I think frankly, therapeutic, I like almost better at this point, you go in and you make people better. Now, we have had some very good luck with remdesivir, that’s been successful and others have been a successful. The plasma has been successful. We’re really coming up with some very good answers, meaning they are. All over the world, we’re working very closely all over the world with the vaccines and the therapeutics. So, we’re going to have some of the heads of these great companies coming in. Johnson and Johnson is doing very well in particular. They seem to be doing very well, but numerous are doing very well. It’s something that I really feel certain. I guess you can use it totally certain, but pretty damn certain that they’re going to have the vaccine. They’re going to have therapeutics and it’s going to start taking place very shortly. That will be a great thing. For the world that will be a great thing. But, this is happening all over the world, not just the United States. And it’s a tough one. It’s very tough. It’s very sad when you see the death. It’s all death that could have been stopped by China. If they wanted to stop it, they could have stopped it. Okay. Thank you very much everybody. [crosstalk 00:10:16]. Thank you. I think it’s very important. I think it’s a very important thing. It’s very good. It’s been proven to be successful. It’s a big saving for the people. It’s a tremendous saving. And I think it’s an incentive for companies to hire their workers back and to keep their workers. The payroll tax cut to me is very important. We’re working on it. And I don’t think there’s too much dispute as to the level of importance, John. It is a very important thing. Okay? That’s one of many elements we’re discussing. We’re discussing probably a total of 10 different elements, but payroll tax cut’s a very important one. Oh, absolutely. I think, hopefully, we’ll get there, but we’re talking about a lot of things, not just the payroll tax cut. Well, we had very successful briefings. I was doing them and we had a lot of people watching, record numbers watching. In the history of cable television there’s never been anything like it. And we were doing very well. And I thought it would be automatic and a lot of positive things were happening. And frankly, a lot of the country is doing well. A lot of people don’t say, as you understand, but we have had this big flare up in Florida, Texas, a couple of other places. So, I think what we’re going to do is, I’ll get involved and we’ll start doing briefings, whether it’s this afternoon or tomorrow, probably tomorrow, and I’ll do briefings. And part of the briefing, I think much more so than last time, because last time we were nowhere with vaccines or therapeutics. And, let’s say that ended six weeks ago, we’ll start them again. I think it’s a great way to get information out to the public as to where we are with the vaccines, with the therapeutics, and generally speaking where we are. And so I think we’ll start that probably starting tomorrow. I’ll do it at five o’clock like we were doing. We had a good slot and a lot of people were watching and that’s a good thing. I think that Kaylee will continue hers at 11 o’clock just like they were. I’ll be discussing the, as I call it, the China virus, the China plague, I’ll be discussing it, and I’ll also be discussing perhaps some other things. But, we’re doing very well in so many different ways, but unfortunately this is something that’s very tough, but we’re going to get it solved. I think we’re going to get it solved in numerous ways, but the two best would be vaccines and therapeutics. So we’ll be having that. It depends on what your definition of troops is. We’re sending law enforcement. Portland was totally out of control. The Democrats, the liberal Democrats running the place had no idea what they were doing. They were ripping down for 51 days, ripping down that city, destroying the city, looting it. The level of corruption and what was going on there is incredible. And then the governor comes out, “We don’t need any help.” How about Chicago? I read the numbers where many people killed over the weekend. We’re looking at Chicago too. We’re looking at New York. Look at what’s going on. All run by Democrats, all run by very liberal Democrats, all run really by radical left. But, we can’t let this happen to the cities. New York was up 348%, the crime rate, so the governor has to do something about it. And if the governor’s not going to do something about it, we’ll do something about it. But, what’s happening in New York, a place I love, I love New York and look at what’s going on over there. The woman who was shot, because you said, “Could you please not let off firecrackers?” And they turned around and shot her eight times and she died. That’s not our civilization. That’s not about us. And then the police are afraid to do anything. I know New York very well. I know the police very well, New York’s finest. And the fact is, they’re restricted from doing anything. They can’t do anything. I’m going to do something. That I can tell you. Because we’re not going to let New York, and Chicago, and Philadelphia, and Detroit, and Baltimore, and all of these, Oakland is a mess, we’re not going to let this happen in our country. All run by liberal Democrats. We’re going to have more federal law enforcement. That I can tell you. In Portland, they’ve done a fantastic job. They’ve been there three days and they really have done a fantastic job in a very short period of time. No problem. They grab them, a lot of people in jail. Their leaders, these are anarchists, these are not protesters. People say protesters, these people are anarchists. These are people that hate our country and we’re not going to let it go forward. And I’ll tell you what, the governor, and the mayor, and the senators out there, they’re afraid of these people. That’s the reason they don’t want us to help them. They’re afraid. I really believe they’re actually, maybe even physically afraid of these people, because what they’re doing is incredible. We didn’t just go there. This wasn’t like it started right away. We went there after 51 days, we said, “We can’t let that happen anymore,” but these are anarchists. And the politicians out there, yes they’re weak, but they’re afraid of these people. They’re actually afraid of these people. That’s why they say, “We don’t want the federal government helping.” How about Chicago? Would you say they need help after this weekend? Do you know the numbers? Did you hear the numbers? Many, many shot, many, many killed. I’m not talking about one, two. Was it 18 people killed? I think more than that. And you add it up over the summer. This is worse than Afghanistan by far. This is worse than anything anyone’s ever seen. All run by the same liberal Democrats. And you know what? If Biden got in, that would be true for the country. The whole country would go to hell and we’re not going to let it go to hell. Thank you very much everybody.

"15","07-21-20","Well, thank you very much and good afternoon. Today, I want to provide an update on our response to the China virus and what my administration is doing to get the outbreak in the Sun Belt under control, seems largely in Sun Belt, but could be spreading. My team is also working night and day with Capitol Hill to advance the next economic relief package. We’re working very hard on it. We’re making a lot of progress. I also know that both sides want to get it done. We’ll call it phase four. I think we’re going to get it done. We’ll protect our workers, our schools, and our families, and protect them very strongly. As one family, we mourn every precious life that’s been lost. I pledge in their honor that we will develop a vaccine and we will defeat the virus. We’re doing very well with vaccine development and therapeutic development. But I want to thank our brave doctors and nurses and frontline responders. The job they do is incredible and they are truly brave. My administration will stop at nothing to save lives and shield the vulnerable, which is so important. We’ve learned so much about this disease and we know who the vulnerable are and we are going to indeed shield them. And again, the vaccines are coming and they’re coming a lot sooner than anyone thought possible, by years. If you look at the old system and look at the new system, I think by years. The China virus is a vicious and dangerous illness, but we’ve learned a great deal about it and who it targets. We are in the process of developing a strategy that’s going to be very, very powerful. We’ve developed as we go along. Some areas of our country are doing very well. Others are doing less well. It will probably unfortunately get worse before it gets better. Something I don’t like saying about things, but that’s the way it is. It’s what we have. You look over the world. It’s all over the world. And it tends to do that. The governors are working very, very hard and we are supporting them 100%. Everything they need they get, and we are taking good care. We have tremendous supplies and a great supply chain, whether it’s ventilators or gowns or just about anything they need. So that’s a big difference from inheriting very, very empty cupboards. The median age of those who succumb to the China virus is 78 years old. Roughly half of all deaths have been individuals in nursing homes who are long term care. In one study, 90% of those hospitalized had underlying medical conditions, whether it’s heart or diabetes, but usually it’s some kind of a condition. It seems that people have that and if they do, it’s a problem, no question about it. Young adults may often have mild or even no symptoms. They won’t even know they’re sick. They won’t have any idea that they have a virus. They won’t have any idea at all. America’s youth will act responsibly. And we’re asking everybody that when you are not able to socially distance, wear a mask. Get a mask. Whether you like the mask or not, they have an impact. They’ll have an effect and we need everything we can get. Data shows children have the lowest fatality risk. 99.96% of all virus fatalities are in adults. Think of that. So that’s much, much, much less than 1% for children, young people. By understanding these risk profiles and learning how to treat the disease, we’ve been able to greatly reduce mortality in the United States. In fact, we’ll show you a chart and how well we do compared to the rest of the world. We have several treatments already available that significantly reduce the severity and duration of the disease, including Remdesivir, which has been very successful, and a widely available steroid treatment, and we have many more happening and coming out. We’ve learned best practices for treatment of the virus at every stage and have shared these findings with medical providers, and we’ve shared them all over the world, that the relationship with other countries has been very strong. We’re all working together. This includes ensuring all hospitals are aware of the importance of different approaches to oxygen treatment including high flow oxygen, the importance of steroid treatment for those on ventilators. And when you’re on a ventilator, we’ve learned a tremendous about the use of the ventilator. And at the beginning, people never had an experience like this, where we needed so many ventilators so fast, and even the use of the ventilators, but the doctors and nurses and helpers have become incredibly good at the use of a ventilator, which is actually a very complicated procedure. And allocating Remdesivir to hospitals based on new admission since it works best early in hospitalization. And that’s something that they’ve really started. They’re using it much earlier. Fatalities nationwide have fallen 75% since mid April. That’s a great number. As cases and fatalities rise in certain hard hit states, which you’re looking at right now, we’re surging personnel, supplies and therapeutics. We again have tremendous amounts of supplies. We are in very good shape and we can move them quickly. Our case fatality rate has continued to decline and is lower than the European union and almost everywhere else in the world. If you watch American television, you’d think that the United States was the only country involved with and suffering from the China virus. Well, the world is suffering very badly, but the fact is that many countries are suffering very, very, very badly, and they’ve been suffering from this virus for a long time. We’ve done much better than most. And with the fatality rate at a lower rate than most, it’s something that we can talk about, but we’re working again with them because we’re helping a lot of countries that people don’t even know about. I get calls all the time asking for help, especially as it pertains to the ventilators. They need help with ventilators. They have to get them. They’re very hard to get. We’re making thousands now a month, thousands of ventilators a month. It’s been quite amazing. We keep doing the good job and things will get better and better. We’ll be putting up charts behind me showing different statistics and different rates of success. And I guess you could say also things that we can do better on, but you’ll see them. They’ll be put up as we go. In April, the average age of individuals who tested positive for the virus was over 50 years old. Today, the average age is significantly younger. Hospital lengths of stay are almost half of what they were in April. So the stays are about half. The rate of cases requiring hospitalization has been reduced. And mortality among those admitted to the hospital is nearly one half of what it was in April. We’ve learned a lot. We’ve learned a lot about this disease, how to handle it. The doctors have learned a lot, not only in the use of the ventilators, but in many other things and things are happening, too, like the Remdesivir and other elements, steroids, etc. But these trends could change without our continued and relentless focus and that’s what we have. We have a relentless focus and it’s been that way from the beginning, but we’ve learned so much. As you know, in recent weeks, we’ve seen a concerning rise in the cases in many parts of our south. If you look at south, southwest and west, this growth in cases first began to appear in mid June, primarily among 18 to 35 year olds, many of whom were asymptomatic. We’re also facing the challenge of a significant spikes in virus cases across the rest of the western hemisphere, including Mexico. Mexico’s been hit very, very, very hard. As you know, the President, a great gentleman, was here two weeks ago and they have really been hit hard. Because we’ve achieved an nearly four fold increase in testing capacity in two months, we’re successfully identifying more asymptomatic and mild cases, some cases so mild that you really don’t even treat them. Some cases with children where they don’t even know that they’re ill. And I guess they’re not very ill because they recover almost immediately. Per capita, the U.S. is conducting 50% more tests than Europe, and we’ve conducted nearly three times as many tests as all of the other countries in the western hemisphere combined, be over 50 million tests. This allows us to isolate those who are infected, even those without symptoms, so we know exactly where it’s going and when it’s going to be there. We’re also working to reduce turnaround time. My administration has been aggressively responding to case growth in the Sun Belt and we continue to do so working very close with all governors, but right now, in particular, those governors. We’re coordinating closely with hospitals and governors. In the last three weeks, I’ve sent senior officials into nine states to meet with governors and provide recommendations to the various leaders of the state, including hospital administrators, etc. My administration currently has zero unfulfilled requests for equipment or anything else that they need from the governors. No governor needs anything right now, and we think we’ll have it that way till the end, because frankly, we are stocked up and ready to go wherever we have to go. We’ve nearly 7,000 National Guard and military medical personnel in Texas, California, Florida, and Arizona. That’s helping us greatly. Want to thank them very much. The military has been fantastic. We’re closely monitoring hospital capacity in these states. Hospitals are open for elective surgeries and other procedures. So hospitals are open for elective surgeries. We want Americans to get the medical treatments they need. All of the governors we’ve spoken with. Say they have enough bed capacity. That’s a great thing. Our initial shutdown was to prevent the overflow of our hospitals and to allow us to meet the demands caused by this global pandemic, including the ventilators, and a permanent shutdown was really never an option in terms of what we’re doing right now. This would be completely unsustainable, produce debilitating economic fall, back, and lead to catastrophic public health consequences. There are consequences to shutdowns and we’ve saved potentially millions of lives by doing the initial shutdown. But now we’re very aware of this disease. We understand the disease to a large extent. Nobody’s going to maybe ever fully understand it, but we’ll end up with a cure. We’ll end up with therapeutics. We’ll end up with a vaccine very soon, all three. We’re instead asking Americans to use masks, socially distance, and employ vigorous hygiene. Wash your hands every chance you get while sheltering high risk populations. We are imploring young Americans to avoid packed bars and other crowded indoor gatherings. Be safe and be smart. We’re surging testing capacity to identify and isolate cases. This includes a newly approved testing platform to nursing homes across the south. We’re being very, very vigilant with respect to nursing homes because you know all of the problems that we’ve had with so many people, so sadly they were infected, so that all of the staff had residents can be routinely tested and isolated to ensure our elderly are even more strongly protected than anybody else. That’s really the high risk people. The high risk wonderful people. Once this current surge in cases declines, the same testing platform will enable people to visit their loved ones after taking a test, which is a big difference. Ultimately, our goal is not merely to manage the pandemic, but to end it. We want to get rid of it as soon as we can. That is why getting a vaccine remains a top priority. Two vaccine candidates are entering the final stage of clinical trials this month. This was achieved in record time. It used to be years before you were in a position like we are right now. Four other vaccines will enter final trials in the following weeks. And we’re mass producing all of the top candidates so that the first approved vaccine will be available immediately, and logistically we have the military ready to go. We have great people, logistic, military people, a wonderful General, who’s waiting for the vaccine so they can distribute it in record time. That’s what’s going to happen. So our military is all set to go. We will deliver a vaccine, therapeutics, whatever it is is necessary, and defeat the virus once and for all. And I’ll take a few questions if you’d like. I will say this. I want to thank all of the staff, the White House staff, all of the doctors that we’ve been working with so closely, and it’s just a lot of very positive things are happening. It’s a nasty, horrible disease that should have never been allowed to escape China, but it did. And it infected the world and the world is suffering, but we’re going to get it taken care of. And we’re helping lots of other countries. John. Well, I didn’t know about more than one. I do take probably on average a test every two days, three days. And I don’t know of any time I’ve taken two tests in one day, but I could see that happening. We’ve done more testing by far than anybody. Some of the tests, because it is massive volume, it takes longer. Others of the tests, as you know, are very quick. They’re five minutes and 15 minute tests. And those are frankly, the ones that I prefer, but we’re doing massive numbers and the numbers are coming down. And as we go, as an example, there are thousands and thousands of kits being made right now, which give you a 15 minute and a five minute test. So we’ll be able to get those numbers down. Those numbers are similar in other places. They’re also doing massive numbers, numbers like nobody thought possible, but those numbers will be coming down. I agree. I think it’s a good thing if we can do that. Well, they’re going to make a presentation to me tonight and tomorrow on that. And again, we’re leading the world. I think the second country [inaudible 00:00:15:50], we’re going to be over 50 million tests. Second country is India with 12 million. Then you have a seven million, six million and four million. I think that we are doing tremendous amount of testing. But if the doctors and the professionals feel that, even though we’re at a level that nobody ever dreamt possible, that they would like to do more, I’m okay with it. Well, Dr. Birx is right outside. Yes, please. Could you speak up, please? This among other things. I think the American people will judge us on this, but they’ll judge us on the economy that I created and that already we’re creating. We’re setting record job numbers as you know. I think we’re going to have a very strong year next year. I think we’re going to have a very strong third quarter, a very good fourth quarter, but I think next year is going to be a record year. And I think they’re going to judge me on that. I think they are going to judge me on the tax cutting and the regulation cutting, which nobody’s ever done to the extent that we’ve been able to do it, on rebuilding the military, on how we’ve handled the VA, on the VA. We got Veterans Choice. Nobody thought that would be possible. That’s been many decades. They’ve been trying to get Veterans Choice. It’s called choice where they can go get a doctor if they have to wait online for two weeks or five weeks or two days. And frankly, that’s been a great thing. Veterans accountability, I think they’ll judge me on that. They’ll judge me on all of the things we’ve done. And I think we can say this with surety, that’s never been even challenged in three and a half years, the first three and a half years, the first years of a presidency, I don’t think any administration, any President has accomplished so much as we’ve accomplished from energy, to health, to so many other things. And then this came in, the plague, I call it the plague, the plague came in, terrible thing. Should’ve been stopped. Wasn’t stopped. It came in. We had to shut things down to save potentially millions of lives. We did that and now we’ve started them up. And I think we’ve really started it up very successfully. Well, the virus will disappear. It will disappear. I always like to say, as you know, either way, when you look at it, the governors are working with me. I’m working with the governor. We’re working hand in hand. I think we’re all responsible. I view it as a team. Very good relationships with the governors, very, very good relationships. I could say I’m fully responsible, but you know, one day we had a virus come in and I closed the borders, did a lot of things that were very good. In fact, Dr. Fauci said we saved tens of thousands of lives when I closed the border and nobody wanted to do it. I wanted to do it. We closed the border to China. We put on the ban. We didn’t want people coming in from heavily infected China. Fairly shortly thereafter, I closed the borders from Europe, coming in from Europe. Those were tremendous moves. If it’s one person that’s too much, but we’re, let’s say 140,000. We could have double, triple, quadruple that number if we didn’t. So we did a lot of things right. We did a lot of things right including with equipment. So it’s a shame that it happened. It shouldn’t have happened. China should have stopped it. [crosstalk 00:19:28] Yes, go ahead, please. Yes. We’re trying to do. That’s a great question. We’re trying very much to do that. So rather than sending your tests in, and you know, it goes through the mail one day, comes back another day no matter how they send them, it’s a day and a day. So that’s two days already wasted. And then if it spends, by the time you get it back, it’s three or four days if they do an efficient job. We’re trying to get the testing on site. I like it the best. I don’t know. I haven’t really been following it too much. I just wish her well, frankly, I’ve met her numerous times over the years, especially since I lived in Palm Beach, and I guess they lived in Palm Beach, but I wish her well, whatever it is. I don’t know the situation with Prince Andrew. Just don’t know. Not aware of it. [crosstalk 00:20:51] Please, go ahead. Well, the economy’s getting stronger and I think we have a chance to have a very strong economy, especially if some of the things that I just spoke about work. We want to have people go back and want to go back to work as opposed to be sort of forced into a position where they’re making more money than they expected to make, and the employers are having a hard time getting them back to work. So that was a decision that was made. I was against that original decision, but they did that. It still worked out well because it gave people a life line, a real life line. Now we’re doing it again. They’re thinking about doing 70% of the amount. The amount would be the same, but doing it in a little bit smaller initial amounts so that people are going to want to go back to work as opposed to making so much money that they really don’t have to. But we were very generous with them. I think that it’s been a tremendously successful program. The whole thing has been successful if you look. I mean, we’re in a pandemic and yet we’re producing tremendous number of jobs. That was something that nobody thought possible. Okay? Please. Well, I do actually do it when I need. I mean, I carry the mask. I went into Walter Reed Hospital the other day. I have the mask right here and I carry it, and I will use it gladly, no problem with it. And I’ve said that. And I say, if you can use the mask, when you can, use the mask, if you’re close to each other, if you’re in a group. I would put it on when I’m in a group. If I’m in an elevator and there were other people with me, including like security people, it’s not their fault. They have to be in the elevator. I want to protect them also. I put on a mask. I have no problem with the masks. I view it this way. Anything that potentially can help and that certainly can potentially help is a good thing. I have no problem. I carry it. I wear it. You saw me wearing it a number of times and I’ll continue. Please. Go ahead. Please. Well, I don’t know. The hotel, I was pretty far away from people, but I would say this. I’ve explained it I think very well. If you’re close together, I would put on the mask. And if you’re not, I would say that if you’re, for instance like here. You’ve been all tested. I’ve been tested. Oftentimes I’ll be with people that are fully tested. I’ve been tested. In theory, you don’t need the mask. I’m getting used to the mask. And the reason is, think about patriotism. Maybe it is. It helps. It helps. Now we have experts that have said in the recent past, that masks aren’t necessarily good to wear. You know that. But now they’ve changed their mind. If they change their mind, that’s good enough for me. So I wear it when appropriate. Please. No. I’ve always agreed with that. I mean, I’ve never fought either one, but certainly social distancing. That’s common sense. Six feet for me is common sense. I’d like to say maybe make it a little bit further. No, we have embers and fires and we have big fires. And unfortunately, now Florida is in a little tough, or in a big, tough position. You have a great Governor there. You have a great Governor in Texas. You have people that are very, very skilled people. And I think they’re going to handle it very well. Their hospital capacities are holding up, but Texas is a big state and it’s very well run, and so is Florida. And I think they’ll do a very good job. Yeah, go ahead. Yeah, we’re willing to work with anybody that’s going to get us a good result. We’re very close to the vaccine. I think we’re going to have some very good results. We’re already in testing. Nobody thought that would be possible. Under the old system, it would be a year to two years before you could even think about using the word testing. And the reason we’re testing, I mean, they’ve had good results. So now we have to see. And they’re testing also for safety because they have to make sure it’s safe. And I think you’re going to see something over the next fairly short period of time, maybe very short period of time, having to do with therapeutics and vaccines that are very good. So we’ll be doing these quite often. We’re going to keep you abreast of this. And we’ll also talk about some of the other topics like our economy which is doing well. The stock market had another good day. I think they have a good day because they see a lot of positive things happening on this front, too. Thank you very much. Thank you.

"16","07-22-20","Today, my administration reached a historic agreement with Pfizer to produce and deliver 100 million doses of their vaccine immediately following its approval. Hopefully, the approval process will go very quickly and we think we have a winner there. We also think we have other companies right behind that are doing very well in the vaccines, long ahead of schedule. As part of Operation Warp Speed, this agreement will also ensure that we receive an additional 500 million doses shortly thereafter. This is another crucial step in our effort to develop, manufacturer and distribute a vaccine in record-breaking time. Really a very small fraction of the time based on previous schedules. I want to thank the FDA. I want to thank everybody involved. It’s been an incredible process. As discussed yesterday, the China virus poses the greatest threat to our senior citizens as we all know. The median age for those who die from the virus is 78-years-old and nearly half of the deaths have occurred among those living in nursing homes or long-term care facilities. That’s really something. In other words, approximately half of the fatalities have occurred among less than 1% of the US population. So think of that, less than 1%, half of the fatalities. So we know what to look for. From the beginning, we have made it our top priority to shelter our seniors. In early March, we announced guidelines suspending all medically unnecessary visits to nursing homes and prioritized resources for those facilities. And we gave it a very strong priority. FEMA has sent shipments to many different locations of protective equipment, and it’s going directly to 15,400 Medicaid and Medicare certified nursing homes throughout the country. Today, I’d like to provide an update on the additional actions we’ve been able to take and they’ve been very constructive. First, we’re requiring increased testing of the nursing home personnel in states where you had the worst outbreaks. All personnel will be tested at the highest level. We’re distributing 15,000 rapid point of care diagnostic devices to support this effort. These are the tests where it takes five minutes to 15 minutes. They’re very accurate. They’re very good. And we’re sending them all over the country. And over 600 devices will be also shipped this week to additional facilities. Second, HHS we’ll be distributing an additional $5 billion from the Provider Relief Fund to all nursing homes. Nursing homes in higher risk areas will be receiving more funding. This money can be used to address critical needs, including the hiring of additional staff, increasing testing and providing technology support so residents can connect their families and they can connect to their families. They are having a tremendous time. They want to be with their loved ones. They can’t do it. So what we’re doing is we’re working it so that we can connect, have them connect with their families if they’re not able to visit. Third, we’ve been identifying especially high-risk nursing homes and sharing that information with the governors so that the governors and their staffs can take appropriate action. We’re able to find because of the testing programs and other means we’re able to find certain areas that are very high-risk. The governors can then take action. Additionally, CMS, CDC and the U.S. Public Health Service are providing enhanced technical assistance and support, including visits to the highest risk nursing homes and that’s their priority right now. Nursing homes, but the highest risk nursing homes. CMS and CDC are implementing a national training program, focused on infection control for those nursing homes that need it most. And we have them surveyed and we have them mostly pinpointed. Over the past few months, we’ve created a surveillance system to detect outbreaks and currently 99% of all nursing homes are reporting directly to it. So we have great data. When a nursing home has three or more cases, we alert this state and make sure that it responds very quickly. We check on it and make sure they respond very quickly. I want to send a message of support and hope to every senior citizen who has been dealing with the struggle of isolation in what should be the golden years of your life. We will get to the other end of that tunnel very quickly, we hope. The light is starting to shine. We will get there very quickly, but we send our love. We send a message of love, very important. We’re with you all the way. As far as the outbreak in the Sunbelt, I said yesterday, we continue to vigorously combat the rise of cases in the south and southwest and the west. We’re closely monitoring and aggressively acting to control the infection in Texas, Arizona, California, Florida. Arizona is starting to come down, done a very good job. They’re all doing a good job. They’re very talented people. There are likely a number of causes for the spike in infections. Cases started to rise among young Americans shortly after demonstrations, which you know very well about. Which presumably triggered a broader relaxation of mitigation efforts nationwide and substantial increase in travel also was a cause. Increased gathering on holidays, such as Memorial Day, as well as young people closely congregating at bars and probably other places, maybe beaches, four or five different listed places. We have 12 that are listed on the guide likely also contributed. We’re also sharing a 2000-mile border with Mexico, as we know very well and cases of surging in Mexico, unfortunately. I was with the president and it’s a big problem for Mexico, but cases are surging very sharply all across the rest of the Western Hemisphere. 257 miles of newly constructed wall along the southern border has had a great positive impact on people coming in. And we have record low numbers of people coming in illegally. That’s helped greatly. It was really meant for a different purpose, but it worked out very well for what we’re doing right now and for the pandemic. Nationwide beyond the outbreak in several states, cases remained low and very stable. 19 States have positive test rates of less than 5%. Eight states have positive test rates of less than 2%. Our nationwide positive test rate is beginning to decline and is currently at 8.8% compared to over 16% at its peak in April, it’s coming down, it’s coming down fairly rapidly. Today, we surpassed first time, we surpassed 50 million tests. That’s far more than any country in the world. India is second we believe. We think 1.4 billion people, that’s about 12 million tests. We have 50 million tests. We’re working with every state to ensure the supply of Remdesivir for early case intervention and steroid treatment and various other treatments for those that are seriously ill. We’re working very closely with hospitals, doctors, nursing homes, everybody. The Remdesivir has proven to be terrific. Our case fatality rate continues to decline and we want to push this rate even lower. The therapeutic research continues daily for new and very promising treatments, including antibody treatments and the use the blood thinners and steroids. A lot of different things are happening and a lot of things are coming out that we wouldn’t have known a number of months ago. We’re doing tremendously well on therapeutic research and tremendously well on the vaccines. And frankly, therapeutically, or maybe a word even beyond that word is cure would be the best of all and we’ll see what happens. But that would be great if we could go into the hospital and just cure people we’re at a position where we’re actually able to, to a certain extent with what we have right now. And we think in a very short period of time we’ll be able to do that. Our strategy is to shelter the highest risk Americans while allowing younger and healthiest citizens to return to work or school while being careful and very vigilant. Wear a mask socially distance and repeatedly wash your hands. Practice very, very good sanitary means. You have to do this. You have to look at it differently. Wash your hands often. I’m finding more and more people are saying, “Wash your hands.” So wash your hands. We want young Americans to avoid packed bars and other crowded indoor gatherings. And we’re all in this together. And as Americans we’re going to get this complete, we’re going to do it properly. We’ve been doing it properly. Sections of the country come up, that we didn’t anticipate for instance, Florida, Texas, et cetera. But we’re working with very talented people, very brilliant people and it’s all going to work out and it is working out. So with that, I’ll take a few questions, please. Yeah, please. But we haven't had that failure. Yeah. The cities, unfortunately, that are in trouble are all run by Democrats. You have radical left Democrats running cities like Chicago, and so many others that we just had a news conference. And unfortunately that’s the way it is. I mean, that’s the facts. When you look at Chicago and you look at the job, Mayor Lightfoot sent me a letter yesterday and I think in their own way, they want us to go in. There’ll be a time when they’re going to want us to go in full blast. But right now, we’re sending extra people to help. We’re arresting a lot of people that have been very bad. As far as the coronavirus, as you say, I think we’ve done some amazing things. And I think you’ll probably see that if you compare our statistics to other countries. And if you look at death rates, et cetera, you’re going to see. And especially into the future with what’s happening, you’re going to see some very, very impressive numbers for the United States. John, please. Go ahead, John. Yeah. Well, I am comfortable with that and we do have a national strategy, but as you know, ultimately it’s up to the governors of the states. I think most governors, many governors want these schools to open. I would like to see the schools open especially when you see statistics like this. We have great statistics on young people and on safety. So we would like to see schools open. We want to see the economy open. We just had a report literally as I walked in, that we set an all-time record on housing, price increases are up. I think they said 21%, which is a record that’s never happened before. That’s a great sign. We have an economy that’s going to be booming. A lot of jobs are being produced. The job numbers will be coming out shortly, meaning over the next week or so. And I think it’ll be a continuation of the last two months. The last two months have been incredible. So I think we’re going to have a great economy. You’re going to have a fantastic next year. I think you’re going to have a very good third quarter actually where the third quarter numbers come out. Interestingly, there’ll be announced just before the election. There’ll be announced around November 1st. So yeah, I would like to see the schools open, open a 100% and we’ll do it safely. We’ll do it carefully. But when you look at the statistics I just read having to do with children and safety, they’re very impressive. They have very strong immune systems. They do say that they don’t transmit very easily and a lot of people are saying they don’t transmit. And we’re looking at that. We’re studying, John very hard, that particular subject, that they don’t bring it home with them now. They don’t catch it easily. They don’t bring it home easily. And if they do catch it, they get better fast. We’re looking at that fact. That is a factor and we’re looking at that very strongly. We’ll be reporting about that over the next week. Please. Well, a lot of the governors, they have different requirements. Some of the governors are really strong on masks, others aren’t. I think it’s really going to ultimately be up to them. We’ve given them the facts we’ve given them everything we know. They have their own facts. Some are strong on masks. And as you know, some aren’t in the same ballpark. Well, I think all is suggesting if you want to wear a mask, you wear it. I bring one, I have one, I’ve worn it. And I think when I’m in certain settings like hospitals or when I’m close, when you can’t socially distance, I believe in it. Let’s see. Do I? I have it. And in certain instances, I think you want to travel with a mask. There are instances where you really can use it. I would believe it would be a good thing. Yeah, please. We’re going to make a decision over the next 24 hours. We’ll let you know what that decision is. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Please. Well, I think a lot of politicians are discussing that Republicans, Democrats and right now a lot of my representatives are on the hill. They’re discussing CARES Act or Phase 4, whatever you want to call it. And I think ultimately something good will come out of it. The economy is starting to really come back strongly. When you look at the numbers, even with the fact that like California is still closed up in many big states. I think the numbers are even more impressive considering that some states like California, big ones are pretty well shut down. So we expect to have something over a period of time, over the appropriate period of time. I said, Democrat politicians. And these are the cities where you have the problem. If you look at Chicago, if you look at Detroit. I mean, look around any of these cities where we have the problems and we’re sending them help. But we’re really waiting for them to call for the big help for the big numbers, for the large numbers of people that we have ready, willing and able. You look at Chicago where 14 people were shot yesterday were over the weekend. Many people died and many people were shot. And over the last month, they’re setting record numbers. We are waiting for the mayor respectfully and other mayors and governors to call us. We are ready, willing, and able to go in there with great force. Now, we also have people that are going in and arresting drug dealers, arresting some of the shooters that are doing the shooting. We know who they are. We’re working with police forces. And even though in some cases they’re told don’t work with the federal government, the police forces have great respect for the federal government and what we do. But we’re ready, willing, and able to go into these cities that are just being decimated with shooting and we’re going to help. Please. Because they’re briefing me. I’m meeting them. I just spoke to Dr. Fauci, Dr. Birx is right outside and they’re giving me all of everything they know as of this point in time and I’m giving the information to you. And I think it’s probably a very concise way of doing it. It seems to be working out very well. They’re very much involved. They’re very much with the relationships are all very good. All very good. The relationships that we have with the doctors, with everybody working on the virus has been, I think, extraordinary. Kayleigh’s here and I think you would say the same thing. You work them all the time. Yeah, go ahead please. Chicago is a disaster. The mayor is saying, “Don’t come in.” The mayor is telling us not to come in. At some point, we can void that if we have to and we may have to because it’s out of control. I assume she’s saying that for political reasons. I think it’s negative political reasons. She’s a Democrat. I’m going to be nice. She’s a Democrat. She’s making a big mistake. People are dying in Chicago and other cities and we can solve the problem. They have to ask us, but we can solve the problem. Because President Obama was invited in and he did a poor job. President Obama could have gone into Chicago, he could have solved the problem and he didn’t. In our case, they don’t want us in. We can solve the problem very easily. We’re equipped with the best equipment, the best people. And you see what we’re doing. I mean, Portland was coming down. It was busting at the seams. And we went in and protected all the federal buildings. Those federal buildings are totally protected and we had to do that. And Portland’s a very different place than Chicago, but Chicago should be calling us. And so should Philadelphia and Detroit and others to go in and really help them. Because when you’re losing many people a weekend, many, many people, you see the same numbers as I do. When you’re losing these people, they should call us and they should say, “Come on in.” And it’s incredible to me, but they’re not doing it. At some point, they will. At some point we may have no other choice, but to go in. Jeff, please. No, I never spoke to Woody Johnson about that about Turnberry. Turnberry is a highly respected course, as you know, one of the best in the world. And I read a story about it today and I never spoke to Woody Johnson about doing that, no. As far as closing additional embassies, it’s always possible. You see what’s going on. We thought there was a fire in the one that we did close. And everybody said, “There’s a fire, there’s a fire.” And I guess they were burning documents or burning papers. And I wonder what that’s all about. Okay. I have about one or two more. Please. You know it’s interesting because we did criminal justice reform. We passed criminal justice reform, something that Obama and Biden were unable to do. We did opportunity cities. We did the greatest if you look at what we’ve done with opportunities zones, nobody’s ever even thought of a plan like that. Prior to the China plague coming in, floating in, coming into our country and really doing terrible things all over the world, doing terrible things, we had the best African American, Hispanic American, Asian American, almost every group was the best for unemployment. The unemployment numbers were the best. So you look at employment, you look at opportunities zones, and maybe most importantly, you look at criminal justice reform, you look at prison reform. I’ve done things that nobody else and I’ve said this, and I say it openly. And not a lot of people dispute it. I’ve done more for black Americans than anybody with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln. Nobody has even been close. Thank you very much, everybody.
















"
"17","07-23-20","Well, I think we have to be in good health. I tell you what, this is a very important job to put it mildly. There is nothing like it and I will also say and I think I’ve had to work harder than others because I’ve been attacked from fronts that nobody ever got attacked on. With fake investigations, fake Russia, Russia, Russia, Ukraine, Ukraine. I mean nobody’s gone through and yet I’ve done more than any president in the first three years in history. There is no president that’s done what we’ve done with rebuilding the military, the judges. We’ll be up to almost 300 judges including two great Supreme Court judges at the end of this term. So it’s really something that’s been great. But you need stamina. You need physical health and you need mental health. And because you have so much fake news every once in a while you’d say, first they’d say, “He wants to take over the world. He’s going to take over the world. He’s a dictator.” The next day they’ll say, “He’s crazy.” The next day they’ll say, “Oh, he’s incompetent.” The next day they’ll say something. So the last time I was at the hospital, probably a year ago, a little less than a year ago. I asked the doctor, I said, “Is there some kind of a cognitive test that I could take?” Because I’ve been hearing about it because I want to shut these people up. They’re fake news, they make up stories. Like I’ll do an interview with you I didn’t say you can’t ask me about this. I say, ask me anything. I did one with Chris Wallace he was nice enough to say he said, “I just want to tell the audience there was no question that’s off bounds.” Okay and he’s a tough cookie. And it was a good interview. I liked it, I enjoyed it and it was good. But I didn’t say you can only ask this, you can only… We have to be sharp. If you’re in the office of the presidency, we have to be sharp. So they were saying all these different things, it was going all over. Whichever stuck, none of it stuck fortunately. But one of the reasons it didn’t is that I took a test. I said to the doctor, it was Dr. Ronnie Jackson. I said, “Is there some kind of a test an acuity test?” And he said there actually is and he named it, whatever it might be and was 30 or 35 questions. The first questions are very easy. The last questions are much more difficult. Like a memory question. It’s a like you’ll go person, woman, man, camera, TV. So they’ll say, “Could you repeat that?” So I said, “Yeah.” So it’s person, woman, man, camera, TV. Okay that’s very good. If you get it in order, you get extra points. Now he’s asking you other questions, other questions and then 10 minutes, 15, 20 minutes later they say, “Remember the first question? Not the first but the 10th question. Give us that again. Can you do that again?” You go person, woman, man, camera, TV. If you get it in order, you get extra points. They said nobody gets in an order. It’s actually not that easy but for me it was easy. And that’s not an easy question. In other words, they ask it to you, they give you five names and you have to repeat them and that’s okay if you repeat them out of order, it’s okay. But it’s not as good. But then when you go back about 20, 25 minutes later and they say, “Go back to that question.” They don’t tell you this, go back to that question and repeat them. Can you do it? And you go person, woman, man, camera, TV. They say, “That’s amazing. How did you do that?” I do it because I have a good memory, because I’m cognitively there. Now Joe should take that test because something’s going on and I say this with respect. I mean, going to probably happen to all of us, right? It’s going to happen, but we can’t take a chance of it happening when you’re dealing with Russia. And there’s nobody been tougher to Russia than me. Nobody been tougher to China than me I can tell you right now they would love to see Joe Biden instead of Trump. We’ve taken in billions and billions, tens of billions of dollars from China, which they never gave us anything. They had the worst year before the plague came in. They had the worst year and they’re just about in their history 67 years, it was the worst year they had in 67 years before the plague. And we were doing great we had the best economy. But we have to have somebody that’s sharp. If this person isn’t sharp because I can tell your president Xi is sharp, president Putin is sharp, [inaudible 00:04:48] is sharp. You don’t have any non sharp people that you’re dealing with. And we can’t have somebody that’s not a hundred percent. So what I did is you know it’s a public test and he said, “If you take this test we may have to reveal that.” I said, “It’s all right. I mean is it tough? Tell me about.” I’d never heard of it. And I got a perfect mark and the doctors they said very few people can do that. Very few people get that you understand? It’s not that easy. There were other questions tougher than what I just did, but it’s not that easy. But as soon as they announced my score and that test, all the stuff went away about me. Is he competent? Remember they’re talking about 25th amendment the nonsense. And they said, wow! And even the enemies they don’t say that anymore. But they do say it about Joe Biden. And honestly he should take the test in a way as an obligation too, because you have to be able to show this country that the person that we’re picking as leader is sharp. Because we’re dealing with people that want to do very bad things to us if they had the chance and you have to be sharper than them. So in a certain way Joe Biden has an obligation to take a test like that one or something else.

"18","07-24-20","Thank you, very much. Please, let’s enjoy ourselves. This is a tremendous moment for Jim and your family. And let’s just enjoy ourselves for a little while. We’ll ask Jim to say a few words. I want to hear what he has to say about his great talent, his great running ability. I find athletics to be extraordinary. I love it. Thank you for being here. And today it is my privilege to present our nation’s highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom to a legendary athlete and a legendary runner, Olympian and true American Patriot, former Congressman Jim Ryun. Jim, congratulations. Fantastic. We’re joined today by Jim’s wife, Anne. Thank you Anne, very much. Congratulations. And various family members. But his son, where’s Ned? Ned, thank you very much. Catharine, thank you very much. And I’m going to ask you to come up and say a few words, the both of you, so you better be prepared. You’ve got a lot of news back there. See, I’m being nice today. I don’t use the other word in front of the word news. But Jim’s journey started with a prayer. After being cut from his church baseball team, I can’t believe that, that must’ve been a bad day, huh, and his junior high basketball team, they probably made a mistake, he asked God for guidance. Jim wanted to know God’s plan for him. And he only had one request, that it was something to do with sports. You liked sports. That prayer was answered when Jim joined the high school track team. He joined it and had no experience whatsoever, as he said, he didn’t really know what he was doing and he didn’t know what he was doing there. In his very first mile race, however, he came in second place to the reigning state champion and a real talented person. Do you ever see him around by the way? He’s still around? Okay, that’s pretty good. He’s still saying, “What happened?” But Jim’s first time in running the mile was four minutes and 32.4 seconds. So that tells you there’s something genetically that’s pretty good, because that doesn’t happen. Four minutes, 32.4 seconds, first time he ever ran the mile. That was the last time he ever came in second in a high school race. And after that, Jim was always first. The next year, Jim ran a 3.59 mile and became the first high school athlete in history to smash the four minute barrier. That summer he also competed in the 1964 Tokyo Olympics as the youngest middle distance runner in the world, by quite a bit actually. In Jim’s senior year of high school, he ran against three time Olympic gold medal winner Pete Snell. He was good wasn’t he? But that was a bad day for Pete. Before the event, Snell reportedly said that he didn’t think Jim would really have much of a chance or be much of a factor. Jim soon proved him wrong. With 300 meters left in the race, Jim surged ahead of the pack and swept across the finish line in a fraction of his time. What was your time? Three minutes and 55.3 seconds. That’s not bad, right? Not bad? I don’t know. What did Pete say? Was he gracious about it? But he was a great runner. I mean, he was a great runner. This also right now stands in high school as a record 35 years. It took 35 years to break that record. When ESPN ranked the greatest high school athletes, listen to this, this is incredible, when ESPN ranked the greatest high school athletes of all time, all sports, they listed Jim Ryun as number one. That’s not bad for guy who couldn’t make his baseball team, right? That’s really an amazing achievement. That’s incredible. Jim continued his extraordinary athletic career at the University of Kansas. In 1966, he set his first world record in the mile at a time of three minutes and 51.3 seconds, becoming the first American to do so in more than three decades. After the race, a young fan ran up to him and asked for his autograph. That fan would soon become his future wife. That was a good autograph. That was Anne. You two are so lucky that happened. I wonder where you’d be, I guess. That’s fantastic. Great, Anne. In 1967, Jim ran an incredible 3.511 mile, which would stand as the world record mile for almost a decade. Jim still describes it as the easiest race he ever ran. Is that right? It was magic. It was magic. To this day, it’s the last time in American set the world record in the mile. So that was a while ago. What is the world record right now? So your at 3.51. 3.43 or so? Okay, that’s a long time. Training and lots of other things. We have breaking news now. This could be the big story today. That’s great. But that is some long period of time that he held the record. In 1968, Jim Bradley represented Team USA at the Mexico City Olympics and won the silver medal for the 1500 and he competed in 1972 at the Munich Olympics with great distinction. A few years later, Jim retired from running. He had been on the cover of Sports Illustrated seven times, was ranked Sportsman of the Year in 1966, was inducted into the Kansas Sports Hall of Fame and received the immortal nickname Master of the Mile. And he was, I remember it. I shouldn’t tell you that, but I remember a lot of your races. They weren’t even close, actually. In 1975, you founded the Jim Ryun Running Camps. For the past 45 years, Jim has helped teach thousands of young people to reach their fullest and best athletic potential. He has been a dedicated mentor to campers and shared in the critical importance of a Christian faith. He is very devoted to Christianity. In 1996, Jim was elected to the House of Representatives and he went on to serve five terms in Congress. I wish we had him now. We have some great people in there though, I’ll tell you. We have some great, dedicated, hard workers and they’ve done a terrific job, right? Wouldn’t you say, Ned? I think so. Some really great ones. But he served five terms from Kansas’s Second District. He was a principled, committed, very tough and beloved lawmaker. That’s what they said. He was tough and yet beloved. That’s a rare combination. Jim has personified the greatness of our country throughout his life, whether he was running on a track race or whether he was doing anything there was, running an office or running for office. He was always the top person. People respected him more. I’ve heard it for a long time. I’d ask about him and they’d say, “When he was in Washington, he was just a respected person.” He was a giant of American athletics, a dedicated public servant and a man of charity, generosity, and faith. He’s a great man, actually. Jim, thank you so much for your unfailing devotion to our country and congratulations on a lifetime of incredible success. Not only athletically, that was obviously a big deal, but what you’ve done in life and even with your family has been just incredible. So I’d like to congratulate you very much. And before we present you with the incredible beautiful metal, I’d like to ask maybe Catharine and Ned to come up and say a few words, if you’d like, and talk about your father. Please. Thank you very much. That's so nice. Thank you, Catharine. Thank you very much. Congratulations. Thank you, everyone. Thank you.

"19","07-27-20","In the thereafter. Not only his Operation Warp Speed, accelerating the development of a vaccine, we’re also directing a colossal industrial mobilization to ensure its rapid delivery. Nothing’s happened like this since the end of World War II. Instead of the usual sequence of vaccine development, testing and trials, followed by production, our strategy is to conduct these phases simultaneously, so everything goes at one time. We’re not waiting and waiting and waiting. It’s all going at one time. We have a system that has, I think it’s unparalleled, has never been done before, but we suspect it’s going to work and work very well. We’re mass-producing all of the most promising vaccine candidates in advance so that on the day one, that it’s approved, it will be available to the American people immediately and we’ll probably have a lot for a lot of other people throughout the world. The world is suffering from this China virus. Another dimension of Operation Warp Speed, is our focus on therapeutics to treat the virus over 100, including Remdesivir, which is having a tremendous impact. You see that with mortality rates and other things, statistically. Dexamethazone, convalescent plasma and antibody treatments, we have numerous treatments right now that are under study. I think over the next couple of weeks, we may actually have some very positive answers as to that. On July 7th, we announced a $450 million agreement with Regeneron to begin advanced manufacturing of its antibody treatment, which is currently in late stage clinical trials, late stage. Due to the medical advances we’ve already achieved and our increased knowledge in how to treat the virus, the mortality rate for patients over the age of 18 is 85% lower than it was in April. Think of that. 85%, and it’s 25% lower than Europe as a whole. In the middle of April, more than 22% of all deaths in the United States were attributable to the China virus. As the last week, that number has dropped down. As of last week, it’s dropped down to under 7%. To decrease the turnaround times for testing, the first two laboratories have been approved to provide pooled testing. Very important. In other words, samples from multiple patients are processed together. They are pooled. Now, pool testing will reduce turnaround times by more than substantially, more than 50%. Last week, our centers for Medicare and Medicaid services began distributing rapid point of care, diagnostic test instruments to all of the nursing homes in the United States, focusing on the areas of greatest need, which is our elderly and our nursing homes. What we’ve already sent, includes testing instruments to 635 nursing homes for 196,000 rapid point of care tests. It’s a tremendous amount. That’s, you’ll get your response and answer from five to 15 minutes. Over the next three weeks, 1,700 nursing homes will receive an additional 800,000 point of care tests. Think of that. The United States has conducted over 52 million tests. That’s more than all of Europe put together times two. Nobody’s even close, and as countries go, it is as an example, India is up to 11 million tests. We’re going to be very shortly at 55 million tests. India has 1.4 billion people. Through our relentless efforts, ` we’ve completely rebuilt our stockpile, which the previous administration depleted and did not refill. The cupboards were bare. I say it often. In total, we’ve now distributed nearly 100,000,095 masks, 35 million surgical masks, 15 million face yields, and much, much more. In addition to that, ventilators, the most difficult thing of all, we are now building thousands a month and we’ll distribute them. We have all we need in our country, but to other countries that are in desperate need, other countries are having a tremendously difficult time with the virus. Last week, FEMA sent additional personnel protective equipment to over 15,000 nursing homes, including 643,000 pairs of protective eyewear, 7 million masks, 34 million pairs of gloves and 6 million gowns. It’s a lot. Over the weekend, cases in Florida, Texas and Arizona held steady and are now heading down. In Arizona they’re heading very substantially down and rapidly. We’ve been constant and in constant communication with the states and are surging them resources, when requested. They largely had what they needed, but anything they need, we send them immediately. We are totally full. We have everything we need. We get it to the states immediately. We deal with the governors. The relationship with the governors has been very good. These states are not out of the woods, but rigorous compliance with guidelines should allow them to turn the corner, and very, very quickly. We are working with every governor and health commissioner, across the country to bring a complete, individualized analysis to each state, as well as tailored recommendation. States are different. My administration is also closely monitoring the surging caseload in Latin America, which is now the region in the world with the most active reported infections by far. Due to the relative scarcity of testing in Latin America however, the regions reported number of cases is also likely to be dramatically undercut or under-counted. I can say that’s probably true throughout the entire world. We report our cases. Most of the world doesn’t. They either don’t do testing, therefore they have very few cases, even though people are sick or they just don’t report. Given the reality of what we just said, we’re focusing aggressively on the Texas border and countries that we think have to be watched very, very carefully, because you have some very, very highly-infected countries outside of our borders. I’ve spoken with Governor Abbott, terrific gentlemen, and I can report that over 3,300 federal personnel are on the ground in Texas. We’ve given them a tremendous amount of extra help, including doctors, nurses, frontline people. We’ve supplied Texas with more than 2.5 million gloves, 800,000 goggles, 337,000 surgical gowns, 1.8 million surgical masks, 1.36 million N95 respirators and half a million KN90 masks. Beginning this week, Texas hospitals, will receive 500 cases of Remdesivir, which has proven very effective, enough to treat 3,200 patients. In addition to the cross border spread, the stage of the pandemic is being fueled by younger Americans who generally have little risk of being seriously harmed by the disease, but can spread the disease. We need all Americans to be conscious about their actions and to exercise extreme vigilance. I trust all Americans to do the right thing, but we strongly advise everyone to especially, especially focus on maintaining a social distance, maintaining rigorous hygiene, avoid large gatherings and crowded indoor bars and wear masks when appropriate. We also strongly urge citizens to take extra precautions, to shield those at highest risk, which are in most cases, in many cases, the elderly, especially the elderly with medical problems, such as heart or diabetes. But you want to shield them and you want to guard them and you want to protect them from the virus, especially, especially those that are really targeted, almost targeted, you could say, by this horrible, horrible plague, this horrible epidemic pandemic. America will develop a vaccine very soon and we will defeat the virus. We will have it delivered in record time as our visit here demonstrates. I want to thank all of the people and representatives from the great state of North Carolina. Is a great place. It’s a phenomenal place. We’ve had so many great meetings and such a great time. I want to drive into the drive and tenacity of your representatives and your politicians has been incredible. When they call, I’m there. When they call, most of them, many of them are sitting here right now. I will always answer their call. Thank you very much. I appreciate you being here with us and let’s get onto a few questions. Tremendous progress has been made and it’s been made rapidly and it’s been made in areas that nothing like that has taken place before. Please, thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Well, I think so. But there would be not that same kind of hope if we weren’t doing so well where, before, just before I left the White House in the Oval Office, we had a meeting with our doctors, scientists, some others, and they’re making tremendous progress with respect to therapeutics. I can tell you therapeutically, I think over the next couple of weeks, we’ll have some really very good things to say. We’re just having great answers. It is about that. It’s also the vaccine that we discussed today at even greater length, is just coming along really well. It’s not just one company. It’s many companies have had tremendous progress. That’ll be announced over the next very short period. Well, I heard very positive things, but by the end of the year, we think we’re in very good shape to be doing that. By the end of this year, we’re going to, in terms of the vaccine, I think in terms of therapeutics, even sooner than that. Therapeutics, meaning you go and you give somebody, whether it’s transfusion or shots or whatever it may be, and they heal and they heal quickly. We’ve had tremendous progress. We already have, if you look at Remdesivir and you look at some of the other things, but we’ll have some announcements on that over the next two weeks. Yeah, it is hope, but it’s only hope because we’ve gotten such incredible results, scientifically. Yeah. We don’t talk about what we discussed, but we had plenty of discussion and I think it was very productive. Please. I don’t think so. I think the recovery has been very strong. We’ve set record job numbers. We’ve set record numbers, whether it’s a pure V or a little bit less than that, I think it’s going to be very good. If therapeutically, we come up with some answers very quickly, which I think we will, then you’re going to have a tremendous recovery, likewise, with the vaccines. If you do that by the end of the year, that’s ahead of schedule, substantially ahead of schedule and it’s ahead of anything that’s ever taken place in terms of vaccines before. I think if those things happen, if just one of those events happen, you’ll go right back into that V and I think you’re probably in the V anyway,. I really do believe a lot of the governors should be opening up states that they’re not opening. We’ll see what happens with them, but a lot will have to do with the fact that therapeutically, I think you’re going to have some great answers, vaccine-wise, likewise. Yeah. Please go ahead. In the back. Well, we’re actually coming to North Carolina as you know. We’re having a very major, I guess that would be the nomination night. That’s a Monday. That’ll be Monday. They’re going to be here and the rest we’ll do in a different form. We could have done it many different ways, but I think we did the right thing and I’m really happy that we’re going to be having a piece of it, at least in a very important piece in North Carolina. Yes, please go ahead. I think the poll numbers are very good. The poll numbers we have are very good. We’re leading in North Carolina. We’re leading in Pennsylvania. We’re leading in Arizona, our numbers. We’re leading in Arizona. We’re leading nicely in Florida. I think our poll numbers are very good. We’re leading substantially in Georgia. I mean, we get a lot of suppression polls. We get a lot of fake polls, just like we have fake news. I mean, it’s a terrible thing when you look at it. But I had the same thing four years ago. I was losing everywhere. I had poll numbers where I wasn’t going to win any state. I ended up winning every one of them. The swing States, I wasn’t going to win any of them and I want all of them. I have the same thing this year. This year, they have it even closer. They have it closer, but it’s the same suppression-type polls. We have polls that show me leading in almost every swing state and substantially in other states, by even more than I won in ’16. When you look at Florida as an example, you have thousands of boats out of the ocean, out on the Intercoastal. You look at other states, where likewise, you have thousands of boats and their all waving the Trump sign, Trump/Pence sign, and they’re so proud. Thousands and thousands. You have seen it where you have bikers for Trump with lines that are miles long on highways going along on weekends. I think there’s more spirit now than there’s ever been for my campaign. That includes 2016, where obviously, there was great enthusiasm, great spirit. We had great spirit. I think there’s more today because what we’ve done nobody’s ever done before. Nobody has ever rebuilt the military, cut taxes, the most in our history, created the greatest economy we’ve ever had, cut regulations at a level that nobody’s ever done. All of these different things, the VA, we got VA choice. We got VA, everything for the VA right now. They had a 91% approval rating. In a recent poll, I was just speaking to the secretary. 91% in the VA, that’s never happened before. I think when people see all that we’ve done, even Space Force, we created a force that actual, Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, right? It’s pretty amazing. Coast guard. Now, Space Force. That hasn’t happened in 75 years. What we’ve done, working with some of those warriors over there, by the way, but what we’ve done has never been done. If you look at Alaska with ANWR, perhaps the biggest drilling site in the world. Even Ronald Reagan and Bush and Clinton, everybody wanted to get it done. I got it done. ANWR in Alaska, probably, or possibly the biggest drilling site in the world. Now, what we’ve done has been incredible. Recently, it looked like the energy business was going to be a catastrophe. We were number one in the world, and then we had the pandemic and nobody was using energy. Nobody was driving in automobiles, no gasoline. By the way, gasoline prices for everyone, a very, very low. In many cases, less than $2. That’s pretty incredible. I saved the energy business. I got Russia and I got Saudi Arabia on the phone and they cut way back and we’re now at $40 and plus a barrel. We’re saving tens of millions of jobs in energy. We’re the number one in energy in the world. With all that we’ve done, we made and brought this country to the greatest point in its history. We never had an economy like we had prior to the China plague or China virus coming in. We never had numbers like it. We are going to have them again, and everyone knows I’m going to rebuild it. I had to close it up. We saved millions of lives by closing it. If we didn’t close I,. You would have seen numbers that would have been 15 times what you have right now. One death is too much, but it would have been 10 to 15 times, maybe more than that, what you have. We closed this greatest economy ever, far bigger than China, better than China. China was having, by the way, the worst year they had in 67 years. Tariffs, they paid us tens of billions of dollars. The worst year they’ve had. Think of it. In 67 years. We were having the best year we’ve ever had. I had to close it and now we’re reopening it. Next year we’ll be stronger. It’ll be the strongest year so far. It’ll be better even than last year. Okay. Thank you very much. I’ll be heading back. I’ll see you back at the White House. Thank you very much. We’re going to take an additional tour of the facility with your great leaders. Thank you very much to the people of North Carolina. We love being here. Thank you.

"20","07-28-20","-manufacturing back to the USA. We’ve been working on this for a long time. This is a core of our strategy to protect our people from the horrible China virus. It should have never happened. It should have never been here. They should have stopped it. In the decades before I took office, foreign nations were allowed to freely plunder our factories and loot our industries, take our business out of the United States. Millions of jobs were vacuumed out, just taken out so easily. Our politicians let that happen, and our communities were stripped and shipped, in many cases to China and all over the world, countries all over the world. Nearly four years ago, we launched a bold effort to revitalize American manufacturing, enact fair trade deals, and bring our industries back home, where they belong. When the China virus landed on our shores, it became clearer than ever before that restoring American manufacturing is a core matter of national security. We must never be reliant on a foreign nation for America’s medical or other needs, and that includes many other needs. I just want to say that Pfizer just announced a little while ago that they’re combining Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials, and the vaccine looks like it’s really heading in a very rapid direction and very positive direction. First time that’s happened, and they’re many months ahead of any other trial. There’s never been anything like it. So it’s the fastest ever. To me, it’s very exciting. Today I’m proud to announce one of the most important deals in the history of US pharmaceutical industries. My administration has reached a historic agreement with a great American company. You remember this company? It’s called, from the good old camera age, the old days, to begin producing critical pharmaceutical ingredients. It’s called Kodak, and it’s going to be right here in America. So I want to congratulate the people in Kodak. They’ve been working very hard. Members of my administration are present in Rochester right now, Rochester, New York, good place, and they’re trying to finalize this groundbreaking deal. They will be announcing this deal. I want to thank Governor Andrew Cuomo and his representatives. We’ve worked really well together on this deal. It’s a big deal. It’s going to be a great deal and a great deal for New York and a great deal for Kodak. 90% of all prescriptions written in the United States are for generic drugs. We have approved more generic drugs than any other administration by far. Generic drugs can be just as good as the brand names, but cost much less. Yet less than 10% of the active pharmaceutical ingredients needed to make these drugs are currently manufactured in America. More than 50%, however, are made in India and China. You’ll be seeing a lot of things that have happened. It’s been happening, but it’s happening at a more rapid pace right now. With this new agreement, my administration is using the Defense Production Act to provide a $765 million loan to support the launch of Kodak Pharmaceuticals. It’s a great name when you think of it, such a great name. Was one of the great brands in the world. Then people went digital, and Kodak didn’t follow. But now under very extraordinary leadership, they are following, and they’re doing something that’s a different field. It’s a field that they’ve really hired some of the best people in the world to be taking care of that company and watching that company, watching over it. But it’s a breakthrough in bringing pharmaceutical manufacturing back to the United States under this contract, our 33rd use of the Defense Production Act. Remember when you were saying I didn’t use it enough? I didn’t use it enough? Then now you heard it’s the 33rd use. We don’t talk about it all the time. We used it, and we used it as a little bit of a threat, frankly, with certain companies that weren’t doing as we were asking them to do. It came through as both a threat and a usage, but this is our 33rd use of the Defense production Act. Kodak will now produce generic active pharmaceutical ingredients, which is a big deal. Using advanced manufacturing techniques, Kodak will also make the key starting materials that are the building blocks for many drugs in a manner that is both cost-competitive and environmentally safe. We’ll be competitive with almost all countries and soon with all countries. Once this new division is fully operational, in addition to all of the other plants that we’ve opened with other companies throughout the United States recently, it will produce as much as 25% of all active ingredients needed to make generic drugs in the USA. That’s a big number, 25%. This agreement will directly create 360 new jobs at Kodak’s factory in Rochester, that’s just in the initial phase, and in Minneapolis, a place I have gotten to know very well. It’s a great place, and I’m very happy that we’re able to help them with the problems that they’ve had recently. The National Guard, I want to thank the National Guard, both state and beyond. I want to thank them for the incredible job. They went in and they did some beautiful job. They cleaned it up. You didn’t hear about the problems anymore. Indirectly, I want to create … We created thousands more jobs all across our pharmaceutical supply chains. We have now been building a very big pharmaceutical supply chain not only coming out of China, coming out of other countries also. I want to thank Peter Navarro, Adam Boehler, and Admiral Polowczyk for their tremendous work to make this deal possible. Today’s action is our latest step to build the greatest medical arsenal in history. We’ll be able to do that through the Defense Production Act and other authorities. We have invested more than $3 billion in our nation’s industrial base. We’ve contracted with companies such as Ford, General Motors, Philips, and General Electric to produce more than 200,000 ventilators by the end of this year, nearly seven times more than we would ever do in a typical year. We’ve contracted with Honeywell, 3M, O&M, Halyard, Moldex, and Lidl to increase US production of N95 masks. We’ve brought it from less than 40 million a month to over 100 million a month by August, and we’ll have 160 million in a very short while, 160 million a month. That’s many times what we used to do, if you go back two years ago, many, many times. We’re increasing domestic production of gloves by 1000%. That’s 1000%. We’ll be manufacturing 450 million gloves annually by next year. We’re finalizing contracts with our textile industry to make gowns in America with American fabric, which makes a lot of our businesses happy that produce the fabric. We have 13 million reusable gowns in the stockpile, and we’ll continue to grow that number to 72 million this fall, which is a rapid escalation indeed. We made major investments in new rapid point of care tests. So there’s nothing like the rapid point, where you get your answer in 5 minutes to 15 minutes to maybe 20, 25 minutes at the max. We’re already at about a 50% level, and we’re bringing it up very substantially from there. We’re growing domestic production from less than 250,000 test kits per month in May to 8 million test kits per month. There is nothing like this that has ever taken place anywhere in the world or close. Through our partnership with Puritan Manufacturing in the state of Maine, great state, we’ve increased production of test swabs from 30 million per month in June to 56 million per month now. As you remember, I went to Maine, I went to the plant where they do this. It was incredible. It was a great experience, and we’ll produce over 100 million swaps per month by January. We’ve dramatically ramped up production of materials needed for a vaccine and are on track to rapidly produce 100 million doses as soon as a vaccine is approved, which could be very, very soon, and 500 million doses shortly thereafter. So we’ll have 500 million doses, and logistically we’re using our military, our great military group of people. Their whole life is based around logistics and bringing things to and from locations, and they’ll be able to take care of this locationally and bringing it where it has to go very, very quickly. They’re all mobilized. It’s been fully set up. A very, very talented general is in charge. When we have that vaccine, it will be discharged and taken care of. It’ll be a very, very rapid process all over the country. Perhaps we’ll be supplying a lot of the vaccine to other parts of the world, like we do with ventilators and other things that we all of a sudden have become very good at making. When the China virus struck our nation, we mobilized the entire government and the private sector to acquire, source, and deliver lifesaving supplies. HHS, FEMA, and the private sector combined have coordinated the delivery of more than 196 million N95 respirators, 815 million surgical masks, 20 million gloves, 34 million face shields, and 354 million gowns. That’s a lot of gowns. Last week, FEMA completed a second shipment of personal protective equipment to over 15,000 nursing homes in the United States. Our big focus has been on nursing homes and senior citizens. As you know, that’s where we want to take care. We have to take care of the most vulnerable, especially if they have a medical difficulty, a medical problem, in particular heart or diabetes. We’ve provided a total of 1.2 million pairs of protective eyewear, 14 million masks, 66 million pairs of gloves, and 13 million gowns. We have replenished the long-neglected national stockpile. In January, the stockpile had 17.9 million N95 masks. Today the stockpile has over 50 million N95 masks, and we’ll be doubling that in a very short period of time and then doubling that number. We’ve shipped more than 14,000 ventilators to areas of need across the country, and we’ve more than 75,000 available to deploy. Not a single American who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator, and if you remember early on, when we were first hit with the virus, ventilators were very hard to come by. Now we’re the largest maker anywhere in the world by far, and not only are we fully supplied in stock, but we’re helping other nations, because ventilators are hard to build and hard to get. This is just the beginning. In the coming months, we will continue the largest onshoring campaign in American history. We will bring back our jobs, and we will make America the world’s premier medical manufacturer and supplier. That’s what’s happening already. It’s been happening now for quite some time. We’re seeing improvements across the major metro areas and most hotspots. You can look at large portions of our country. It’s corona-free, but we are watching very carefully California, Arizona, Texas, and most of Florida. It’s starting to head down in the right direction, and I think you’ll see it rapidly head down very soon. But if you look, California, Arizona, Texas, and for the most part, most of Florida starting to head down. In the wake of the recent mass gatherings Americans have witnessed in the streets of Portland and Seattle, we are also tracking a significant rise in cases in both metropolitan areas because of what’s been going on. We, as you know, have done an excellent job of watching over Portland and watching our courthouse, where they wanted to burn it down. There were anarchists, nothing short of anarchists, agitators, and we have protected it very powerfully. If we didn’t go there, I will tell you, you wouldn’t have a courthouse. You’d have a billion-dollar burned out building. We’re also working aggressively to combat the virus in Native American and Alaskan Native communities. Under the CARES Act, we provided $8 billion to address the coronavirus in tribal communities, and we’ve worked very hard with tribal communities. They’re very vulnerable to this horrible plague. That’s the largest investment in Indian country in US history. There has never been an investment that big in Indian country. We need every American to help protect our fellow citizens and prevent the spread of the disease. It’s critical that younger Americans remember that even though they are at lower risk and in fact, some age groups are at extraordinary low risk themselves, they can unknowingly spread the virus to others who are at higher risk. I ask all Americans regardless of background or age to practice social distancing, which people have gotten very used to, but we have to keep doing it. Remain vigilant about hygiene. Avoid indoor gatherings and large gatherings, but especially indoor, especially where you have crowded bars, and that you wear a mask whenever appropriate. Through the genius of our scientists, the devotion of our doctors, the skill of our workers, and the dedication of our people, we will achieve victory over the virus and emerge stronger than ever before. We’re looking at a very powerful year next year economically. The job numbers are looking outstanding, to put it mildly, setting records. The numbers on retail sales came in two weeks ago at the highest number in the history of our country. So we look like we’re heading to some very, very good economic times. That means jobs. That means stock market. Stock market is already doing very well. It’s getting to a point very close to where it was when we were hit with the plague. So I just want to thank everybody for being here. Steve, please, go ahead. We’ll be doing a speech on Thursday, the main speech, the primary speech. Charlotte, they will be doing nominating on Monday. That’s a different period, a different thing happening, but they’ll be doing nominations on Monday. I speak on Thursday. Okay? We'll be announcing it soon. Does anybody have any ideas? We'll be announcing it very soon. Yeah, there are, actually, and we’ll be talking about it. There are also things that I very much support, but we’ll be negotiating. It’s sort of semi-irrelevant, because the Democrats come with their needs and asks and the Republicans go with theirs. So we’ll be discussing it with Mitch and all of the other people involved. Kevin has been very active, as you know, all of the people involved. Steven Mnuchin has done a great job, keeps everybody together, both Democrat and Republican. We’ll see. We want to do what’s best for the people. I want to do what’s best with the people. I want to do what’s best for the economy, because that means jobs and lots of good things. All right? I wasn’t making claims. The recommendations of many other people, including doctors, many doctors think it is extremely successful, the hydroxychloroquine coupled with the zinc and perhaps the Zithromycin. But many doctors think it’s extremely good, and some people don’t. Some people … I think it’s become very political. I happen to believe in it. I would take it. As you know, I took it for a 14-day period, and I’m here, right? I’m here. I happen to think it works in the early stages. I think front line medical people believe that, too, some, many. So we’ll take a look at it, but the one thing we know, it’s been out for a long time, that particular formula, and that’s essentially what it is, the pill. It’s been for malaria, lupus, and other things. It’s safe. It doesn’t cause problems. I had no problem. I had absolutely no problem. Felt no different. Didn’t feel good, bad, or indifferent. I tested it, as you know. It didn’t get me, and it’s not going to hopefully hurt anybody. So we know because it’s been so many years, from a safety standpoint, it’s safe. I happen to think, based on what I’ve read … I’ve read a lot about hydroxy. I happen to think that it has an impact, especially at the earlier use. There were some very good tests at Ford, and the doctor from Yale came up with a very, very strong testament to it. There was a group of doctors yesterday, a large group that were put on the Internet. For some reason, the Internet wanted to take them down and took them off. I guess Twitter took them off, and I think Facebook took them off. I don’t know why. I think they’re very respected doctors. There was a woman who was spectacular in her statements about it, that she’s had tremendous success with it, and they took her voice. I don’t know why they took her off, but they took her off. Maybe they had a good reason. Maybe they didn’t. I don’t know. I can only say that from my standpoint and based on a lot of reading and a lot of knowledge about it, I think it could have a very positive impact in the early stages. I don’t think you lose anything by doing it, other than politically, it doesn’t seem to be too popular. You know why? Because I recommend it. When I recommend something, they like to say, “Don’t use it.” John? No, not at all. I don’t even know what his stance is on it. He was at the task force meeting a little while ago. I have a very good relationship with Dr. Fauci. It’s sort of interesting. We’ve listened to Dr. Fauci. I haven’t always agreed with him, and that’s, I think, pretty standard. That’s okay. He did not want us to put up the ban to China when China was heavily infected very badly, Wuhan. He didn’t want to do that, and I did and other things. He told me I was right, and he told me I saved tens of thousands of lives, which was generous, but I think it’s fact. Then I did the ban on Europe. But I get along with him very well, and I agree with a lot of what he said. So it’s interesting. He’s got a very good approval rating, and I like that. It’s good, because remember, he’s working for this administration. He’s working with us, John. We could have gotten other people. We could have gotten somebody else. It didn’t have to be Dr. Fauci. He’s working with our administration, and for the most part, we’ve done pretty much what he and others, Dr. Birx and others who are terrific, recommended. He’s got this high approval rating. So why don’t I have a high approval rating and the administration with respect to the virus? We should have a very high … because what we’ve done in terms of … I was just reading off about the masks and the gowns and the ventilators and numbers that nobody’s seen and the testing. At 55 million tests, we tested more than anybody in the world. I have a graph that I’d love to show you. Perhaps you’ve seen it, where we’re up here and the rest of the world is down at a level that’s just a tiny fraction of what we’ve done in terms of testing. So it sort of is curious. A man works for us, with us very closely, Dr. Fauci, and Dr. Birx also, highly thought of, and yet they’re highly thought of, but nobody likes me. It can only be my personality. That’s all. Go ahead. We’re going to work with a lot of people on DACA, and we’re also working on an immigration bill, a merit-based system, which is what I’ve wanted for a long time. That decision was an interesting decision, because it gave the President as a President more power than many people thought the President had. So the President is now, which happens to be me, in a position where I can do an immigration bill and a healthcare bill and some other bills. You’ve seen some of them come along. We’re going to do tremendous … We just signed it three days ago. We’re going to do tremendous prescription drug price reductions, tremendous. It could be over 50%. Whether it’s favored nations clauses or anything else, I mean, it’s tremendous numbers we’re talking about. You go to some countries, and they’ll sell a pill for ten cents. In the United States, it costs $2. It’s the same basic factory. It’s the same everything. The United States bears the cost of all of these low prices that you see all over the world, where people go to Canada to buy a prescription drug from the United States. Not going to happen with me. It’s not going to happen with me. So John, I think one of the exciting things got very little coverage, and that’s okay, but the people understand it. I think we will be reducing prescription drug prices by massive amounts, numbers that have never been done before. Other thing, in 51 years, we got, as you know, last year drug prices came down first time in 51 years that they came down. Now, with what I signed last week, I think that drug prices can come down by numbers like 50% and even greater in certain instances. We are going to make DACA happy and the DACA people and representatives happy, and we’re also going to end up with a fantastic, merit-based immigration system. Please. I didn't know a meeting was cancer. Oh, a meeting with the drug-Well, I said there would be a meeting. Yeah, a meeting sometime this week, yeah. They want to meet. I mean, I don’t know that it was canceled. They want to meet. I thought the meeting was actually scheduled for tomorrow. I thought the meeting was scheduled tomorrow. Sorry about the dates. I see how upset you are by it. Go ahead, please, Bloomberg. Bloomberg, Mr. Bloomberg. You look like just a Mr. Bloomberg. Go ahead. We’ll do something. We’re going to take care of the people. Yeah. That’s a good question. We’re going to take care of the people. Well, maybe it’s [inaudible 00:25:28]. Maybe it’s not, but I can tell you this. She was on air along with many other doctors. They were big fans of hydroxychloroquine. I thought she was very impressive in the sense that from where she came, I don’t know which country she comes from, but she said that she’s had tremendous success with hundreds of different patients. I thought her voice was an important voice, but I know nothing about her. Yeah, go ahead, [crosstalk 00:25:53]. Go ahead. Okay. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you.

"21","07-29-20","Thank you, Cody. Good job you did Cody. He was [inaudible 00:08:57] but he’ll be up there very soon. He’s doing good. Come on sit down please. Let’s have some fun. I really am thrilled to be here in Midland, Texas with the extraordinary men and women of Double Eagle Energy, and what a nice welcome. Thank you very much. [inaudible 00:09:18] big beautiful rigs behind me. Thanks to the hard working citizens like you in United States Of America this is now the number one energy superpower anywhere in the world, so congratulations. It’s not that easy, but no one said it’s easy. We’re here today to celebrate your incredible achievements, we are also here to send a clear message to the Zealots radicals and extremists trying to shut down your and to make America subservient to foreign producers. That won’t happen to this nation again. Long time to be independent, and as long as I’m your president, we will never let anyone put American energy out of business, which is what they’d like to do. We will never again be relying on hostile foreign suppliers. We will defend your jobs and we will defend the Lone Star State, I love this state. We will defend Americans who found energy independence. Before going any further I want to provide you with a brief update on our battle against the China virus. Our hears are with the people of Texas. We love our people. We love our country. Statewide presentive patients testing positive has stabilized, and the number of new cases has begun to substantially decline. But Texans must remain vigilant. To protect our seniors my administration has deployed personal protective equipment and rapid point of care testing systems to every Medicare and Medicaid-certified nursing home in your state. No matter where you go they have it. This week, access hospitals are receiving 500 cases of antiviral treatment remdesivir. It’s been very, very successful. Enough to treat 3200 patients. Under my administration’s Operation Warp Speed, we’re developing vaccines in record time. Earlier this week, a promising vaccine entered the final stage of clinical trials long ahead of schedule, with more following very quickly behind. We have some of the greatest companies, labs in the world doing this. This is the fastest a vaccine has ever been developed. Together we will end the plague from China. We will defeat the virus. I want to thank everyone at Double Eagle Energy for hosting us today, including co-founders, two great, young, smart people, Cody Campbell and John Sellers. Thank you, Cody. Thank you, John. Thank you fellas. Good job. Thanks also to anterior secretary David Bernhardt. David, thank you. Energy secretary Dan Brouillette, Texas says keep him, we really kept him very busy. Where’s Dan? You’ve been kept very busy, very busy. A great Senator and a great friend of mine, Senator Ted Cruz. Ted, thank you. He’s out there fighting for you. I want to tell you. Thank you Ted. Representatives, and these are friends of mine and they’re warriors, Jodey Arrington and Mike Conaway, thank you fellas. Thank you. Thank you. Great job. A very, very special man and a very special talent, Governor Greg Abbott. Thank you. Thank you, Greg. Great job you’re doing. He’s working hard and you’re doing a fantastic job. Our people are working together and you’re getting everything you need. So good. Thank you for doing such a good job and thank also Dan Patrick, your Lieutenant governor, my friend. Thank you very much, Dan. Great help, great team. No better team in the country. Thank you. Midland County judge, terry Johnson. Thank you Terry. Thank you. Your former governor, a great man, a friend of mine, secretary of energy, Rick Perry. Nobody did a better job than my Rick. Thank you Rick. We have so many other distinguished guests and local leaders and we just want to thank you all for being here. Thank you all very much. Great honor. Thank you very much for being here. Under the last administration, America’s energy industry was under relentless and unceasing attack, you know that. But the day I took the oath of office, we ended the war on American energy and we stopped the far left assault on American energy workers. Now the assault, you’ve seen what’s going on. It could come again. But I have a very strong feeling you’re not going to have to worry about it. If you do you’re in big, big trouble. I withdrew from the one-sided, energy destroying Paris Climate Accord. It was a disaster. It cost us billions of dollars and it would have made us a noncompetitive nation. We canceled the Obama administration’s job crushing clean power plan. You know all about that. I improved the Keystone XL and the Dakota Access Pipeline immediately upon assuming office. We opened up ANWR in Alaska to energy exploration, ended the moratorium on coal leasing on federal lands and reopened public lands and offshore areas to oil and gas exploration. That’s where David Bernhardt’s done such a great job. Thanks David. We unlocked the full energy potential of Texas and New Mexico, and New Mexico, we’re proud that we’ve been here. We’re proud to help. You have been fantastic. A lot of jobs. Since my election oil and gas production in the Permian Basin has more than doubled. Under the Trump Administration the United States has increased oil production by 3.1 million barrels per day. That’s some number, never been anything like that number. For the first time in nearly 70 years, we have become a net energy exporter, and the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas on the face of the earth. To ensure we maintain this dominant position long into the future, we will never lose this position, my administration is announcing today that export authorizations for American liquified natural gas can now be extended through the year 2050. Mr. Governor is that long enough? Okay, 2050, that seems like a long time. He said let’s make it longer. At the same time, we’re strongly protecting our environment. Air pollution is down significantly since I took office. While other countries are polluting the world’s air and oceans, we will never cease to be a leader in protecting our natural environment and that’s what’s happening. People don’t know that about us. We love our environment. Under my administration the United States will continue to have among the cleanest air and cleanest water anywhere on earth and that’s what we have. Thanks to our pro- American energy policies, we’re also taking jobs in factories away from countries with poor environmental standards, such as China, and bringing jobs back to America, where they belong. Before the invisible enemy struck our shores, we created 800,000 new energy jobs, a third of them in Texas. That was just the new jobs. Add onto that millions of other jobs. After the China virus struck we implemented historic economic relief. When oil crashed, I got Saudi Arabia, Russia and others to cut nearly ten million barrels a day and got OPEC plus and Mexico to agree to the deal and hence we’re okay. Now we’re back. We’re back. I will tell you, and I can tell you that I spoke with Dan and Greg and I spoke with Senator Ted Cruz, I spoke with a lot of people and we were very close to losing a very powerful, great industry, and we did a job. We did a great job all together, working together, a job like I think nobody could have done, and now we’re back and now we’re just going to keep expanding. You will see. It’s happening, but we really did. We did a great job and I want to thank, frankly, Saudi Arabia. I want to thank Russia. I want to thank Mexico, and I want to thank OPEC as they call it, Plus. It’s called OPEC Plus. That’s OPEC, Plus a lot of other countries. But they all came to together and they did a job for the industry and we appreciate everybody’s help. This action stabilized world oil prices that had been in a free fall and saved millions of energy jobs, and frankly it saved your industry. Four months ago people were very, very concerned about that industry, and now it’s just going to be a question of how fast will you put people on. Through the Paycheck Protection Program we provided over one billion dollars in emergency aid to keep Texas energy workers on the payroll. We kept them all in the payroll. We opened up 30 million barrels of space in Strategic Petroleum Reserve, allowing American companies to store surplus oil to be sold at a later time, and we filled up our 75 million barrels in the Strategic Reserve. And Dan, you’ve done a fantastic job on that. Thank you very much. I only wish he bought it when the oil was selling for zero and they paid you $37.00 in addition. You get a barrel plus $37.00, I said, “Dan, why didn’t you make that deal?” I would have loved that, but you did well. Thank you very much. Today I’m taking another bold action to support energy jobs in Texas. In a few moments, I will sign four critical permits granting approval to vital pipeline and railway infrastructure on our nation’s border. That’s a big deal, this will include two permits allowing the export of Texas crude to Mexico, a giant victory for the workers of this state that you’ve been after for many years, right? You’ve been after that one for many years. I said, “What do I know about it? If you want to do it, it’s okay with me,” and we’re doing it, so that’s been a long time in the making. We’re joined today by some of the incredible patriots of the Texas oil and gas industry who are benefiting from America’s energy boom. Josh [inaudible 00:21:15] was born and raised right here in Odessa and Midland, where’s Josh? Thank you Josh. After spending a few years away at school, Josh came back home to West Texas. Josh’s dad worked on the oil rigs. Josh worked on the oil rigs and he hopes his three children will work one day doing the same kind of incredible work and looking for the wonderful opportunities in American energy. Josh, thank you very much. Congratulate your family. You’re going to have a great future. Thank you. Appreciate it. Brian Welch spent five years in the army, supporting our victory in the Gulf War. Then he became … Hello, Brian. Thank you Brian. Then he became an energy worker. Did you make the right move, Brian? I think so, right? Better believe it. With over 25 years of experience, Brian, a senior pumper with Double Eagle Energy, do they treat you well? They better, they better, I’m going to come back and see those two guys. Just like thousands of other veterans who work in this industry, Brian has made America safer with his service and now he’s helping keep us secure by maintaining American energy independence which we have. Thank you very much Brian. Great job. To Brian and every veteran who works in the American energy sector, we salute your noble service and we thank you very much, we thank you very much, everybody, thank you. While my administration is fighting for workers like you, the radical left, have you ever heard of the radical left, Brian? You don’t want to hear about them. You don’t want to know about them, is fighting to abolish American energy, destroy the oil and gas industries and wipe out your jobs. Washington Democrats have embraced Representative Ocasio-Cortez’s nearly $100 trillion Green New Deal disaster. I have added the fourth word, it’s a disaster, which would ban oil and gas leasing on all federal lands and by the way there would be no fracking, so let me ask you Mr. Governor, how do you think that works in Texas? No fracking, no drilling, no oil, is that okay? Good. I don’t think Biden’s going to do too well in Texas. He’s already written it off, it’s gone. No fracking, that’s part of his platform. If these far left politicians ever get into power, they will demolish not only your industry but the entire U.S. economy. Their stated agenda includes rejoining the Paris Climate Accord, spending billions and billions of dollars in order to make us non-competitive, and seeking an even higher level of restrictions mandating net zero carbon emissions which frankly is impossible, for all new homes, offices and buildings by 2030, not possible to do, and if you ever did it, it would cost so much that your home would be valueless. This would cause the cost of construction to skyrocket and effectively end the use of natural gas in homes because it would be an impossible situation. They’re asking for things, just so you understand, that are impossible. I don’t know, I haven’t checked recently, what have they done with cows? Remember there were going to be no more cows and no more cattle. I think they might have left that one off the manifesto but it will be back. Their platform calls for mandating zero carbon emissions from power plants by 2035. In other words, no drilling, no fracking, no coal, no shale, no gas, no oil. Otherwise they’ve been very good to the industry I think. You got to be careful. People don’t take it seriously. If they got in, you will have no more energy coming out of the great state of Texas, out of New Mexico, out of anywhere. Oklahoma, North Dakota, name them. Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania does a lot. People don’t realize that, a lot. It would throw Pennsylvania, Ohio, so many other places, you don’t realize how big it is, they want to have no fracking, no nothing. The policies required to implement this extreme agenda would mean the death of American prosperity and the end of the American middle class. It would mean I think even worse than that. It would destroy our country. I used to say we would become another Venezuela, same ideology, you would become another Venezuela. Venezuela used to be one of the richest in the world per capita and period one of the richest in the world, among the largest oil reserves. Now they don’t have water, they don’t have medicine, they don’t have food, you got a lot of oil, it doesn’t matter. Doesn’t seem to matter. They don’t have anything, and that can happen to us. All you have to do is look at Portland, look at the agitators, look at the anarchists in Portland and our people have done a great job in protecting our courthouse and I told my people a little while ago, if they don’t solve that problem locally very soon, we’re going to send in the National Guard and get it solved very quickly just like we did in Minneapolis and just like we will do in other places. They want to solve their problem, they’ve got a very short time to do it, but they’ll either solve their problem or we send in the National Guard. The U.S. energy industry would grind to a halt and every single energy producing state would be plunged into a depression. Two million jobs would vanish overnight in just the state of Texas alone, and I think the number’s probably Greg a lot higher than two million. Millions more would disappear in New Mexico and Ohio and Colorado and Pennsylvania. By imposing these punishing restrictions and beyond restrictions, the Washington radical left crazy Democrats would also send countless American jobs, factories, industries to China and to other foreign polluting states. They want us to take care of our air but China doesn’t take care of its air. In all fairness, India doesn’t take care of its air. Russia doesn’t take care of its air, but we do. Not on my watch it’s not going to happen I can tell you that. Because as long as I’m president, we will always put America first. It’s very simple, very simple. For years and years we put other countries first. We now put America first. As we have seen in cities and towns across our nation, it’s not just Texas oil that the radical Democrats want to destroy, they want to destroy our country. These people are sick. They are sick and you better get used to hearing it because they have some real problems. They don’t love our country. In any way, shape or form, they don’t love our country. There’s no respect for the American way of life. There is no way of life ever in history that’s been like the great American way of life. There’s no respect but there is by you and there is by 95% of our people. Our people love our country and our people love our anthem and they love our flag. Remember that. The radical left wants to tear down everything in its way and in its place they want power for themselves, they want power. Hard to believe, power. They want to uproot and demolish every American value. They want to wipe away every trace of religion from national life. They want to indoctrinate our children, defund our police, abolish the suburbs, incite riots, and leave every city at the mercy of the radical left. That’s not going to happen. That’s not going to happen. By the way, I just ended the rule on suburbs. You know the suburbs, people fight all of their lives to get into the suburbs and have a beautiful home. There will be no more low income housing forced in to the suburbs. I abandoned and took away and just rescinded the rule. It’s been going on for years, I’ve seen conflict for years. It’s been hell for suburbia. We rescinded the rule three days ago, so enjoy your life, ladies and gentlemen. Enjoy your life. The proud people of Texas will never bow, kneel or surrender to the left-wing mob. You will always stand tall and strong for America. Everyone here today carries the legacy of some of the toughest, fiercest, and most determined people ever to walk the face of the earth, your ancestors. You know that. You know that generations of Texas oil workers before you gave every last bit of sweat and heart and grit that they had to build up this country. They loved our country. They loved our country so much they couldn’t breathe. Their pride and devotion help raise up America cities, power our factories, propel our industries, sustain our families, supply our military and fuel America’s rise into the strongest, wealthiest and greatest nation the world has ever known. We are now at the strongest point militarily, we’ve ever been due to… I’ll tell you, Ted? Where is Ted? He was a big leader in this. Stand up again, Ted. Ted Cruz, John Cornyn, and our Senate and our House approved $2.5 trillion to rebuild entirely the United States military. It’s now at a point that it’s the strongest it’s ever been. A lot of the equipment is still coming in, brand new planes and missiles and everything you can think of. And I want to thank you, Ted. You were one of the real leaders, and John too. The two of you, I appreciate it very much. You are well-represented. We have the greatest equipment on earth. We have equipment that I can’t even tell you about. You don’t want to know about it, frankly, and hopefully we’d never have to use it. Now it’s your turn to help lead our nation to even greater heights. Today we give thanks for each and every one of you. And we are telling the Washington politicians trying to abolish American energy, don’t mess with Texas. And I just want to finish by saying that I’ve had a great relationship with your leaders, with your politicians. With all the people in Texas, we’ve had great success. We had a great victory. They said, “Oh, I don’t know if he’ll win.” And we won. Not only did we win, we won quickly and easily. And now we’re leading what we had even four years ago. I will never let you down. I will never let Texas down. And your governor and lieutenant governor and your senators, they know that very well. Thank you. And thank you very much, Greg. Dan, thank you very much. Ted, thank you. Great job. God bless you, and the great state of Texas, God bless you. God bless you. On behalf of every American energy worker, I will now sign these very important permits that your governor and your senators have been after me for a long time to sign. And they’ve been after a lot of other presidents to sign them, but they never were able to get it done. But we got it done. And we got it done for a great state called Texas. Thank you very much everybody. Where's Greg? Greg, you there? Where's Cruz? Let's give this to the governor, okay. You want to give that to the governor. Here you go.
















"
"22","07-30-20","Hello. Thank you very much. Let me begin by expressing our sadness at the passing of a wonderful man and a dear friend of mine, Herman Cain. He was a very special person. I got to know him very well, and unfortunately he passed away from a thing called the China virus. And we send our prayers to Herman’s great wife, Gloria, wonderful family. And I have to say America grieves for all of the 150,000 Americans who had their lives taken by this horrible, invisible enemy. We mourn their loss as a nation. We mourn their loss as people, as people that love one another and we’re working very hard to not only contain this horrible event, this horrible plague. It’s what it is, is a plague, but also to come up with therapeutics and vaccines and we’re making a lot of strides. All over the world, they’re having tremendous problems. Resurgence has taken place in many countries that people thought were doing well. Despite a wide range of approaches to the pandemic between countries, this resurgence in cases is occurring throughout large portions of our planet in Japan, China, Australia, Belgium, Spain, France, Germany, Hong Kong. Places where they thought it was they’ve really done great, it came back and then a couple of cases came back very strongly. The virus was said to be under control but new cases have risen very significantly once again. So when you think somebody is doing well, sometimes you have to hold your decision on that. You have to hold your statement. Since the beginning of June, daily new cases have increased by a factor of 14 times in Israel. 35 times, that’s 35 times in Japan and nearly 30 times in Australia, just to name a few. These were countries that were doing incredibly well. Leadership was being praised. Latin America now leads the world in confirmed infections and with the scarcity of testing in Latin America, the true numbers, you have no idea what they might be. I can say scarcity of testing almost anywhere, except for our country. This disease is highly contagious and presents unique challenges to our border states. Meanwhile, states like California, Washington state, Maryland, Virginia, Nevada, Illinois, Oregon, and many others, they were thought to be doing well and they had a big resurgence and were hit very hard and governors that were extremely popular are not so popular anymore. They were held up as models to follow and then they got hit and I’m not even saying this their fault. It’s probably not their fault. It’s just the way it is. That’s the way it is. Highly infectious. One of the most infectious diseases that anybody has ever seen. Not since 1917, over a hundred years ago, has anyone seen anything like what we’re witnessing now. But these states have also seen the virus substantially rebound and again, no one is immune. No one is immune. These facts illustrate the imposing determinant and it is a determinant, that a blanket shutdown to achieve a temporary reduction in cases is certainly not a viable longterm strategy for any country. People are starting to understand the disease now. We certainly have understood a lot about the disease that we didn’t have any idea. We didn’t. Nobody ever saw anything like this. The primary purpose of a shutdown was to flatten the curve, ensure sufficient hospital capacity and develop effective treatments and therapies to reduce mortality. We’ve done that but it can come rearing back when you least suspect it. We did the right thing initially. We saved millions of lives, what we did. Did the right thing. But a permanent shutdown would no longer be the answer at all. A small shutdown of certain areas but we don’t want to do that. Small shutdowns can be very helpful but not for long periods of time. We understand what we’re dealing with now but it’s a very complex situation. I can only say thank heaven that we are so advanced in what we’re doing in terms of vaccines and therapies. We now know a great deal about the virus and how to treat it and who it targets. Almost half of the deaths come from less than 1% of our population. Think of it. Half of the deaths, really tremendous number, half of the deaths come from less than 1% of our population; those living in nursing homes and assisted living facilities. The average age of those who die from the illness is 78. We’ve announced very strong measures to protect those who are most vulnerable. The scientific path forward is to protect those at highest risk while allowing those at lower risk to carefully return to work and to school with appropriate precautions. I’m once again, urging the American people to protect their dear family and friends and anybody who’s elderly, especially if somebody is elderly and they have heart problems, if they have certain illnesses. Diabetes is very bad one, having to do with what we’re discussing. But you want to protect the elderly and socially distance. Wear a mask if you cannot socially distance and practice, vigorous hygiene. Everyone, even healthy young people should be taking extraordinary care to avoid infecting those at the highest risk from this terrible disease. The elderly and those with chronic health issues have to be protected. In the current hotspots across the Sunbelt, the data is showing very encouraging signs. Arizona in particular has crossed an important threshold. For every person with a virus, we’re now seeing an average of less than one additional person infected and the numbers are coming down and coming down very substantially. They’re starting to come down and Florida. Arizona’s really leading away. I was in Texas yesterday and they’re starting to come down significantly, we believe in Texas. Need another few days to figure that one out, but it looks like they’re coming down very significantly. Earlier today, I visited the Red Cross Headquarters to discuss plasma therapy, which is a tremendous, tremendous thing that they’re looking at. They have a lot of experience with it. Potentially life saving treatments that infuse sick patients with powerful antibodies donated by those who have recovered successfully from this disease. More than 2 million Americans have recovered from the virus and today we’re asking them to visit Coronavirus.gov, Coronavirus.gov, and volunteer to donate plasma. We need plasma. It’s something that’s been very effective and we need plasma from those that were infected and successfully recovered, as most people do, most people do. Plasma is one of the many promising treatments my administration is accelerating. We’ve secured over 90% of the world’s supply of Remdesivir, which is terrific and encouraging antiviral drug that can effectively block replication of the virus. We’ve also approved the use of the widely available steroid, which has been very successful Dexamethasone, which has shown success, even in patients at more advanced stages of the disease. On July 17th, we announced a $450 million agreement with Regeneron to build manufacturing plants and hundreds of thousands of doses of its antibody treatment, which is currently in late stage clinical trials. Moving along very rapidly. That’s Regeneron. As a result of such significant strides in treatment, the mortality rate in those over the age of 18 is 85% lower than it was just April. So in a very short period of time, think of that. Just 18, 85% lower than it was in April. It’s a big statement. Now I want to provide an update on our efforts to ensure a strong economic comeback, including our negotiations on Capitol Hill. Throughout this crisis, my administration has taken the most aggressive action in history to rescue American workers. We love our American workers and we’ve set records on job creation. Records, two months in a row. We enacted a $ 3 trillion economic relief package. The Paycheck Protection Program alone saved over 50 million jobs. We delivered $300 billion to direct cash payments to Americans. We approved $500 billion for our hardest hit industries. $500 billion. We allowed struggling homeowners to reduce or defer their mortgage payments and we put a nationwide moratorium on evictions from federally backed properties. It was a big thing, very big thing. We also suspended student loan payments for six months and we’re looking to do that additionally and for additional periods of time. As a result of these extraordinary steps by the administration, we edit a record 7 million jobs into two months past alone, to ensure this comeback continues, which we think it will; a great foundation to build on. We were the strongest country in the world. Nobody close. We were outdoing everybody from China. If you remember for many years, you heard that in 2019, China would surpass the United States. Well, it didn’t. We gained on them very significantly. We took it to a level that nobody’s ever seen 2019, and we’ll be back there very shortly. It will take very long based on everything that we’re seeing. It’s not going to take very long. I think next year is going to be an excellent year. Maybe one of our best years ever, from an economic standpoint. We can never, ever forget the people that have been lost and we never will. We’ll never forget them. Never forget what happened. This could have been stopped in China. They should have stopped it and they didn’t. But I’m asking Congress to pass additional legislation to support Americans in need. First, we want a temporary extension of expanded unemployment benefits. This will provide a critical bridge for Americans who lost their jobs to the pandemic through no fault of their own. This was not anybody’s fault from the standpoint of jobs. It Happened. Terrible thing happened. It could have been stopped. It happened. I want to thank Senate Republicans for fighting to extend unemployment benefits today in the face of very strong Democrat obstruction, which I’m surprised at, because this is great for our country and it’s great for our workers. Because this is great for our country, and it’s great for our workers, and it wasn’t our worker’s fault. Second, we’re asking Democrats to work with us to find a solution that will temporarily stop evictions. We do not want people who have lost their jobs due to the virus to be evicted from their homes or apartments. We don’t want that to happen. Third, we need Democrats to join us to pass additional economic relief payments for American citizens, like the payments sent directly to 160 million Americans earlier this year, which was a tremendously successful program. This money will help millions of hardworking families get by. My administration is also asking Democrats to work with us to pass $105 billion to help schools safely reopened. Children are not at the lowest risk. If you look at what’s going on, the younger, the better. Amazing, the immune system. But children … the lower they are in age, the lower the risk in terms of the age group itself. I tell the story that in New Jersey with thousands and thousands of people dying … sadly dying, the governor was telling me that only one, Phil Murphy, only one died under the age of 18. That’s incredible. With thousands of people that died in the state of New Jersey, one made an impact. One died under the age of 18. Children are at the lowest risk of any age group from the virus. Indefinite school closures will inflict lasting harm to our nation’s children. We must follow the science and get students safely back to school, while protecting children, teachers, staff, and family. We have to remember that there’s another side to this. Keeping them out of school and keeping work closed is causing death. Also, economic harm. But it’s causing death for different reasons, but death … probably more death. If governors do not want to open the public schools, the money should go to parents so they can send their children to the school of their choice. We say if a school doesn’t want to open or have a governor doesn’t want to open, maybe for political reason and maybe not. But there is some of that going on. The money should go to the parents so they can send their children to the school of their choice. If schools stay close, the money should follow the students, so families are in control of decisions about their sons and daughters. About their children. But to pass a bill, Democrats must reject the extreme partisan voices in their party. They have tremendous voices. They’re looking at November 3rd … and probably a day later, they’ll say, “Let’s open up the country.” But the Democrats have to reject the extreme partisan voices in their party so that we can get our country going even quicker than it’s going right now. We have a lot opening, and we have a lot of states that you thought were doing pretty poorly from the standpoint of the virus, and are actually coming back very strong. This pandemic has underscored the importance of economic policies that put American families and workers first. Got elected on the fact that I put America first. For many, many decades, in my opinion, we put America last. If you look at the crazy horrible, disgraceful trade deals that we’ve watched for many years destroy our country … NAFTA, we terminated it. We have USMCA now, which is a great deal. And the farmers are doing really well despite the pandemic. But we put America first: America’s families first, and America’s workers first. But that means bringing jobs in factories back to our shores, reducing unnecessary regulations, and creating new training opportunities for jobs and for the future. We’ve cut regulations at a level that no president has ever cut regulations, and we’ve cut taxes more than any president in the history of our country. Americans always rise to the challenge, and we will emerge more resilient, more self-reliant, more independent, and more prosperous than ever before. I just want to thank you all. And if you’d like, we’ll take a few questions. Steve, please. Well, what I want to explain to people … but it doesn’t need much explanation. I mean, you look at article after article. New York’s Mail Vote disaster. Tens of thousands of mail ballots have been tossed out in this year’s primaries. What will happen in November? It’s a mess. This is done by Washington Post. Can you believe it? The Washington Post, of all papers. Fake news. But in this case, it’s not fake. It’s true. This is done by the Wall Street Journal. Here’s another one: Vote By Mail Experiment Reveals Potential Problems Within Postal Voting System Ahead in the November Election. And you see what’s happening with so many different places. They’re doing even trial runs. They’re a disaster. I don’t want to see an election … So many years I’ve been watching elections, and they say the projected winner, or the winner of the election. I don’t want to see that take place in a week after November 3rd, or a month. Or frankly, with litigation and everything else that can happen years, years … or you never even know who won the election. You’re sending out hundreds of millions of universal mail- in ballots. Hundreds of millions. Where are they going? Who are they being sent to? It’s common sense. You don’t have to know anything about politics. And the Democrats know this. The Democrats know this, Steve. I want an election and a result much more than you. I think we’re doing very well. We have the same fake polls, but we have real polls. We’re doing very well. I just left Texas, and Biden came out against fracking. Well, that means Texas is going to be one of the most unemployed states in our country. That means Oklahoma, North Dakota, New Mexico … going to be a disaster. Ohio, Pennsylvania. Disaster. No fracking. I want to have the result of the election. I don’t want to be waiting around for weeks and months. And literally potentially, if you really did it right, years. Because you’ll never know. These ballots are missing. You saw Patterson, New Jersey. You saw many other instances. There’s tremendous litigation on that right now, and that doesn’t include absentee. Absentee is different. Absentee, you have to work. You have to send in for applications. You have to go through a whole procedure. For instance, I’m an absentee voter because I can’t be in Florida, because I’m in Washington. I’m at the White House, so I’ll be an absentee voter. We have a lot of absentee voters, and it works. We’re in favor of absentee, but it’s much different than millions of people in California. They’re going to send out tens of millions of voting forms. Well, where are they going to go? You read where postmen are in big trouble now. You read where city councils are in big trouble now. Voter fraud all over the ballot. No, I want to be standing hopefully hand held high, big victory, because we’re doing things with our country that I think nobody else could have done. Our country is … despite this pandemic, which is devastating the rest of the world, by the way. Devastating. One of the articles that came out was the world’s COVID resurgence. This is The Wall Street Journal. [inaudible 00:32:19] The Wall Street Journal. I don’t always agree with them, but they have the world’s COVID resurgence. “Countries held as models to see …” and then they go, ” the virus returns” at a level like they haven’t even seen. We’ve been giving praise to certain countries, and the virus has now come to them like the first time. But it’s very interesting, and it talks about many countries where everybody was holding them up and saying what a great job they did. Well, it’s just one of those things. Didn’t work out so well. We want to have an election. I’d love to see voter ID, but this is the opposite of voter ID. The Democrats love it. The Republicans hate it. We all agree that absentee voting is good. Mail-in ballots will lead to the greatest fraud. We talk about Russia, Russia, Russia for two and a half years, and then they found nothing, and there was nothing. But they talk Russia, Russia, Russia. They talk China. They talk all of these countries. They say they get involved in our elections. This is easy. You can forge ballots. This is much easier for foreign countries. Go ahead-I just feel … I don’t want to delay. I want to have the election. But I also don’t want to have to wait for three months, and then find out that the ballots are all missing, and the election doesn’t mean anything. That’s what’s going to happen, Steve. That’s common sense. Everyone knows it. Smart people know it, stupid people may not know it, and some people don’t want to talk about it. But they know it. No. We want to have an election where people actually go in and: what’s your name? My name is so and so. Boom. You sign the book like I’ve been doing for years. It’s very, very unfair to our country. If they do this, our country will be a laughingstock all over the world, because everyone knows it doesn’t work. How many ballots is he sending in California? Is it 28 million, or some massive number? Other states are sending out millions and millions of ballots. Well, they’ve done it. They had experiments. They had news organizations experimenting. Look, read the story in the Washington Post about mail-in voting. It’s a disaster. I’m very surprised to see that story, frankly, from them. The story’s a disaster. We’re asking for a lot of trouble. And no, do I want to see a date change? No. But I don’t want to see a crooked election. This election will be the most rigged election in history if that happens. Yeah? Well, we have many court cases. We have one that’s been filed for a while now in Western Pennsylvania, as an example. On mail-in ballots. [crosstalk 00:35:23] by the way, we give tremendous examples … numbers of examples of all the fraud, and all of the things that have taken place with respect to mail-in ballots. Well, it’s had an interesting impact. I didn’t know it was going to be the impact it had. What people are now looking at is, “Am I right?” But not me. Are all these stories about the fact that these elections will be fraudulent, they’ll be fixed, there’ll be rigged, and everyone’s looking at it. And a lot of people are saying, ” That probably will happen.” Please, Jennifer. Well, it’s a great question. I can’t tell you though because that wouldn’t be very smart from a negotiating standpoint. But we’ll be putting certain things on the table. We want to get money to people. It wasn’t their fault and we want to get money to people and it has to be substantial. It’s not their fault what happened. The fact is people don’t like saying it. They know it’s true. It’s China’s fault. Okay? It’s not their fault. It’s not the worker who lost his job. It’s China’s fault. And that’s the way it is. OAN, please. So our people have done, Homeland Security, have done a fantastic job. They went to Oregon a little more than a week ago. The place was a mess. The city, Portland, was just a disaster, you see it, and a lot of people weren’t reporting it right. They tried to pretend it was a protest as opposed to anarchists and agitators. You understand what I’m saying. It’s a mess. They went there a short while ago and they saved a federal courthouse that costs hundreds of millions of dollars. And they put a ring around the courthouse and they saved it. But the group that’s there is basically meant to save buildings and they were very strong, very powerful, and they didn’t come out too often out of this cocoon that they built in order to save these very expensive, valuable, and psychologically important buildings, like courthouses. The Governor and the Mayor, we’ve been dealing with them and we think they don’t know what they’re doing because this should not have been going on for 60 days. It’s not our job unless in case of emergency, which I consider now to be an emergency. It’s not our job to go in and clean out the cities. That’s supposed to be done by local law enforcement. Yesterday, the Governor worked a deal where they’ll do it. We’ll stand by, they’ll do it. And that’s good. That was very good, but she didn’t report it that way. What she reported was totally different. She said, “I think Trump wants to take over the country.” It’s crazy. So what happened is our people are staying there to see whether or not they could do it today and tomorrow. And if they don’t do it, we will send in the National Guard and we’ll take care of it. And we’re telling them right now, these protesters, and many should be arrested because these are professional agitators. These are professional anarchists. These are people that hate our country. We’re telling them right now that we’re coming in very soon. The National Guard, a lot of people, a lot of very tough people, and these are not people that just have to guard the courthouse and save it, these are people that are allowed to go forward and do what they have to do. And I think that makes the Governor’s job and the Mayor’s job a lot easier. So they’re working today and probably tomorrow to clean out this beehive of terrorists. And if they do it, I’m going to be very happy. And then slowly we can start to leave the city. If they don’t do it, we’ll be sending in the National Guard. Please. So can you assure anybody of anything? I do say, again, young people are almost immune to this disease. The younger the better. I guess they’re stronger. They’re stronger, they have a stronger immune system. It’s an incredible thing. Nobody’s ever seen this before. Various types of flu will hurt young people more than older people. But young people are almost immune. If you look at the percentage, it’s a tiny percent of 1%. It’s a tiny percent of 1%. So we have to have our schools open. We have to protect our teachers. We have to protect our elderly, but we do have to have our schools open. Yeah, please. Go ahead. Well, I think you’re seeing it and I think you will see it. And one of the things that we’ve done that we’re getting, and it hasn’t been utilized fully yet, but we’re all set to march when it comes to the vaccine. We have great therapeutics that are testing very well and we have great vaccines from incredible companies. Johnson&Johnson and Pfizer and Merck and all of these great companies, and they’re doing very well. And the delivery system is all set. Logistically, we have a general that that’s all he does is deliver things, whether it’s soldiers or other items. And I think you’re going to see something that’s going to be spectacular. The FDA has approved things at a rate that’s a tiny fraction of what it would take during another administration, let’s say. We are way ahead on vaccines, way ahead on therapeutics, and when we have it, we’re all set up with our platforms to deliver them very, very quickly. The vaccines are doing well. The therapeutics are doing well and we’re all set to deliver them as soon as we have them, and that’s going to be very soon. Thank you very much. Thank you.

"23","07-31-20","Thank you very much, and thank you for being here to discuss the relentless work that we’re doing to defeat the China virus and protect the people of Florida. Great state. Just got the endorsement of the sheriffs, and they are amazing people. The law enforcement in Florida is very, very, very first grade. We appreciate that endorsement in particular. First, I want to provide a update to our response and on our response to hurricane. So the hurricane is a … I’m not sure it’s a hurricane yet. Right now-it’s sort of projected as a storm/hurricane, right? What’s going to happen? Is that looking like a hurricane to you, Ron? Let’s keep it there. Let’s not let it get any bigger. But it’s pretty severe nevertheless. A lot of water coming in. It’s approach approaching the Florida coast. The storm’s already passed through Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, and I’ve approved emergency declarations for both of those areas. FEMA is closely coordinating with Florida, with your governor, happens to be on my right. Good job, by the way, Ron. You’re doing a great job. And we’re in constant contact with Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Alabama, and anybody else that may have a problem. But we think it’s going to work out very well. We have FEMA all set to go. In some of those states, they were already there. I ask all of those in the path of the storm to follow the guidance of your state, local, and tribal officials. My administration will be here for you every single step of the way. We’ve done everything we can do, and now we’re just waiting for the storm. And I guess it’s right behind me. It’s following me. We’re grateful to be joined by Health and Human Services’ Secretary is doing a fantastic job on COVID or whatever you want to call it. There are many different names. All we know is it came from China, and they shouldn’t have let it happen. But Alex Azar is here. Thank you, Alex, very much. Governor Ron DeSantis doing a fantastic job. Thank you. Previous Governor and now Senator Rick Scott. He’s representing Florida very well in Washington. And I just spoke with Marco Rubio, and likewise he’s doing a great job, and he sends his regards. State Senator Wilton Simpson. Thank you very much, Senator. Great job you’re doing. State Representative Daniel Perez. Daniel, thank you, Daniel, very much. Pinellas County Commissioner Kathleen Peters. Hi, Kathy. Thanks very much. And CEO, Safety Net Hospital Alliance of Florida, Justin Senior. Thank you. Thank you, Justin, very much, very much for being here. We continue to take very aggressive action to combat the virus in Florida, and your state officials are amazing. They’ve been working so hard. The rate of positive cases in Florida has now declined. It’s declining. And hospitalizations are declining in most places and pretty steadily, and we think there’s going to be a big decline starting very soon. There’s currently over 21% inpatient hospital bed capacity available, so there’s plenty of bed capacity. And over 16% ICU capacity available, and some of that’s going to be emptying out as people get better. They do get better, and they get better pretty fast. Statewide, we’re providing additional resources and personnel to help save lives. We remain concerned about Florida, about Miami, and in a certain area of Miami in particular, but local officials are working very hard, and we think we have that one on the right step also. The test positivity rate has declined over the last week, and in some cases very substantially, as have hospitalization levels. But we must further reduce the spread, and that’s what we’re doing. We’re working closely with health officials on the ground to support this effort. The single best way to defeat the disease is personal responsibility. You’ve heard me say it. You’ve heard a lot of people say it, actually. I urge all Americans to protect the elderly. The fact is you have to do the social distancing thing. It’s very important. Socially distance, wear a mask when you cannot avoid crowded places or socially distance, and wash your hands as often as possible. Almost half of all deaths nationwide have been in nursing homes and assisted living centers. And I have to say the state of Florida, with regard to the nursing homes, has done an incredible job. Really an incredible job. They watched what was happening in some places, even beyond our own country, the other countries, they were seeing what was happening with the elderly and particularly in nursing homes. And Ron, you’ve done a great job on that. Appreciate it. I have to say that there’s been a big surge of the China virus in other countries, very big countries that we thought they were doing a good job. And they were. They were doing a great job in some cases. But a big headline in the Wall Street Journal just yesterday and an editorial that all of a sudden they started to surge. So countries that we thought were doing great turned out to have big difficulty. I won’t name the countries, but you know them, there are a lot of them actually. The average age of those who succumb to the virus is 78 years old. We’re also closely monitoring the situation in Latin America and its impact on the United States. Latin America has more confirmed cases than anywhere else in the world. Actually, substantially more. Having a hard time. We’ve sent many ventilators to Latin America. We’ve sent many ventilators to different countries in Europe, Africa, and all over the world. We’re making thousands of ventilators now a month. We started off with essentially very little, and we become a ventilator manufacturer, so to speak, and we’re helping a lot of countries. We’ve sent them to France. We’ve sent them to Italy. A lot to Italy. We sent them to Mexico. We sent them to Russia. Moscow is having a tremendous problem. And we’ve sent him to a lot of different countries, many. And we have a full supply in our country. The amazing thing is we started with very few, and not one person that needed a ventilator did not get a ventilator, so that’s a pretty amazing statistic. We have nearly 1,400 federal personnel on the ground already in Florida, including personnel supporting nursing homes. We have doctors, military doctors. They’re incredible and very talented people. And frankly, they’re very brave people, but they’re all over the state, helping with your medical folks. And Ron asked if he could get some extra people here. We did it immediately. In the last week, we’ve opened five new surge testing sites in Florida. In Fort Lauderdale, Hollywood Beach, Pompano Beach, and two in Miami. We’re sending rapid test kits to 701 Medicare and Medicaid certified nursing homes in the state. We’ve also sent multiple shipments of protective equipment to all of the nursing homes. And as I said on ventilators, I can also talk about in Florida, in Miami, they have everything they need. They don’t need any. We’ve sent a lot. They don’t need any. Testing-wise, we’ve tested almost 60 million people throughout the country, which is about six times more than any other country, close to six times more than any other country. If you look at India, they’re at 11 million. We’re going to be at over 60 million, so they’ve done a tremendous job in testing considering we started off with very little. It was a unknown disease, and it was an unknown test. FEMA, HHS, and the private sector have delivered more than 10,000,095 masks, 43 million surgical mask, 19.7 million gowns, and 1.3 billion medical gloves to Florida. 1.3 billion gloves, Ron. We’ve secured 90% of the world’s supply of remdesivir, which has been very, very successful. And I’ve sent over 143 vials to Florida hospitals as a really something that’s very special and we’re working on very hard. Operation Warp Speed today, we reached a $2-billion agreement with Sanofi and GSX to conduct clinical trials and mass produce 100 million doses of vaccine. What we’ve done is a rather incredible, I have to say. We have many companies, great companies, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Pfizer, many companies are very close to getting the vaccine. We think it’s going to be in a very short time from now. And we’re set with our military to deliver the vaccine. We have a tremendous military delivery service, and that will be doing it. It’s called logistics, and they will be taking the vaccine and bringing it all over the country. And I’m sure that we’ll be supplying it beyond our country also, but we’re going to have it very soon. We’re also having a tremendous work done on other treatments other than vaccines. So we have a lot of great things in the pipeline, I think things that are going to be really spectacular. I’m very excited about therapeutics because therapeutically, I think we have answers that are really looking good. In fact, if I had my choice, I’d probably initially maybe go with the therapeutics because you walk into the hospital, they get a shot or they do a transfusion depending on the company and what they’re doing. And a short time later, just people get better. So we’re looking at that very, very strongly. I just want to thank Rick and Ron and everybody, done really a fantastic job. We’ve worked together so long and so hard, and this is something that came upon us. It should’ve never happened, but it came upon us, and there’s been great bravery from our doctors and our nurses, our frontline. And there’s been great bravery from our doctors, and our nurses, our frontline people. And we’re very proud of what’s happening, and we’ll get rid of it. We’ll beat it. And it’ll be soon. We want to get our schools open. We want to get our businesses open. Much of the country is open. We’ve set records on number of employees, and hiring, and employment. Basically, if you look at the number, I think last month was the highest number ever hired in one month. And the month before that, we broke that record. So from that standpoint, we’ve done well. Retail sales set a record last month. So we’re doing really record increase. So we’re doing really well. And I think this will end hopefully very soon, but we’re fighting hard, and we’re fighting smart. And I’d like to ask your governor to say a few words. Please, Ron. And you have the numbers in five minutes to 15 minutes or something-Especially for the elderly. Rick Scott, please. That's great Rick, thank you very much. Thank you, Rick. And the speed of approval is just a tiny fraction of the time that it would have been in let’s say another administration. The FDA has been fantastic. They’re getting things through, Ron, at levels that nobody ever thought possible. We’re close to a vaccine. We think we’re close to a vaccine. And that’s been a matter of months, as opposed to many years. It could be take many years. And we think we’re going to have a great answer very, very soon. Alex, please. That’s right. Thank you very much, Alex, I appreciate it. Please, go ahead. And I just signed an executive order whereby the gentlemen on my right can go out and buy your prescription drugs at a number that you’d never thought possible. And I assume you’re going to be doing that pretty soon, Ron, right? Go ahead, Justin. Thank you. Well, you’ve really done a good job in the nursing homes. When I look at you compared to other places, frankly, you’ve really done a great job with nursing homes. I know you’re focused on it, but that’s been a very good situation compared to other places. Well, that's been an amazing job. Kathleen, please. Wow, that's great. That's great. Good job. Really good job. Thank you very much. Please. Right. That was an amazing group of people, wasn't it? As long as we rode, and we rode a long time, we had tremendous crowds. And we appreciate it and we love Miami, we’ll take care of it. Okay? Great job you're doing. Do you have any questions, please, for anybody? Well based on the polls, I’m doing very well in Florida. And the local government is doing a fantastic job. I think we’re doing really a fantastic job and we’re getting everything that they need. They’ve, for the most part, had it anyway. We had it all stocked up and stacked up. And you remember, I used to say the cupboards were bare, federally. From the federal standpoint, we had very empty cupboards. Whether it was the military or the cupboards for medical, they were bare. And Ron, I think Ron and Rick would both say, we’ve really supplied you with a lot, not only having to do with the medical and the COVID, but having to do with a lot more, in particular, some of the hurricanes. In your time and your time, we had some really bad ones and we came through. So, the polls are looking very good. And I think when you see those crowds people along the roads, there’s a very good feeling. Well, I hate it anywhere. But if you look at other countries, other countries are doing terribly. This is a horrible disease. This is a disease that should have never happened. It’s something never should have been allowed to get out of China, but it did. It came here. It went to Europe. It went all over the world. It’s in 188 countries. And I will say this, proportionately, relatively, when you look at your nursing home situation, it’s a tribute to your governor and government, the job they’ve done. You’ve done a really great job. And you have a very big nursing home population. You’ve done a fantastic job. So, I think we’re doing really well in Florida. Yeah? I read it all the time. I see it all the time. It was never brought to my attention. I think it’s another Russia hoax. They’ve been giving me the Russia hoax, shifty Schiff and all these characters, from the day I got here. And we’re working with Russia right now on a non-proliferation agreement, nuclear, non-proliferation, and if we can get something like that it’d be great, but it was never brought to my attention. And because it didn’t reach the level, there were a lot of people, including Democrats, that said it never took place. If it did take place, it would have been brought to my attention. And I would take very strong action. There’s been nobody tougher with Russia or China than I have, not even by a long shot. When you look at what we’ve done compared to the past administrations, it’s not even a contest. We’ve been very tough on Russia with the sanctions and so many other things, including letting people know that we’re not so happy about what’s going on with NATO and the oil. But speaking of NATO, we’ve raised $130 billion a year from countries from as you know, from our partners with NATO, 28 countries. We had seven that were paid up. Now we have a very much bigger number. We’re getting $130 billion more. That’s going to $400 billion, and that’s money to really protect themselves for the most part against Russia. So nobody’s done more against Russia, but it was never brought to my attention. And it perhaps wasn’t brought because they didn’t consider it to be real. And if it is brought to my attention, I’ll do something about it. Well, we’re going to be doing a healthcare plan. We’re going to be doing a very inclusive healthcare plan. I’ll be signing it some time very soon. It might be Sunday, but it’s going to be very soon. We’re also doing a full immigration plan. We’re going to take care of a lot of things that for 25 years, they’ve been trying to get an immigration plan. We’re going to be doing merit based immigration. I’m sure you’ll be happy to hear that, but it’s merit based, very powerfully merit based. It’s going to be very inclusive. It’s going to cover just about everything that most people would have said couldn’t happen. And we’ll be releasing that over the next couple of weeks. We’re doing a healthcare plan. We’re doing a immigration plan and we’re doing another one that’s very important are the drugs, prescription drug prices. We pay the highest of any country in the world by far. You look at Germany and you look at UK and Canada and other countries, and they pay a fraction of what we pay. And we’re doing a series of signatures, which I’ve done. And one goes into effect very soon, but we’re doing matching grants and all sorts of things that are got to bring our drug prices down at levels that nobody ever thought possible. We’re doing things that nobody ever thought possible. The bad news is the pharmaceutical companies aren’t exactly in love with Donald Trump and they’ll advertise. They’ve already started it. I see they’ve already started. Have you seen the ads? And anytime you see an ad from a pharmaceutical company against me, you know that means the drug prices are coming down. But they’re going to be coming down to a level that nobody ever thought possible. As an example, Germany has very low prices and we have very high prices, many times the amount, and we have to get, no matter what the price, lowest price in the world, that’s what they have to give us. And right now we have, by far, the highest price in the world. We’re going to allow states like Florida go to Canada and to buy their prices are much lower than ours. So they’re going to be able to buy directly from Canada rather than going through their traditional sources. And I think in the state of Florida, what will that cut the prescription drug prices? How about that? 75% less. So they’re going to be buying it approximately 75% less. What we’re doing really, which is the most, we’re doing rebates. And the rebates are going to go to the people and they’re going to go in the form of drug reduction, drug price reduction. But we’re doing something called favored nations. And nobody thought anybody would ever do that. But look, I want what’s right for the people. And it’s been very unfair. So favored nations, meaning if another nation is paying lower and another nation is paying even lower than that, we take the lowest nation in the world and that’s what we have to pay. Right now we’re paying many times the lowest nation in the world. You have some of these socialistic or social, well, I guess you could say socialistic nations, they have drugs at a low price. Well, we’ll use that to our advantage because we’re going to be getting the price that they have. Now, what’s going to happen is that price will probably have to go up and our price will go way down. And I could see 50, 60, 70%, maybe more than that reduction in prices that no other president will ever do that. And the heat I’ve taken in the last couple of weeks because of that is unbelievable. And frankly, the ads I’ve taken are unbelievable. It’s sort of incredible. You see drug companies taking these massive ads. Keep in mind, the same drug that you paid a fortune for, for half the price maybe better than that even, the exact same drug made maybe in the same factory, the same company. And you’re going to be paying a fraction of the price. But the drug companies are not happy. And look, we want them to be happy. We want them to do well with the vaccines and we want them to do well with everything, but they’ve made a fortune and that’s why they could afford the ads. That’s for sure. So when you see ads against us, and me in particular because I’m the one that, I’ve signed four acts, we’ll call it executive orders. And they’re the most powerful ever signed in this industry by a factor of about 20. And it’s going to bring your drug prices down to a level that you’ve never seen before. I’m very happy about that. The drug companies don’t contribute to my campaign. I don’t need their money. I haven’t asked for their money. And if they did, it wouldn’t matter to me anyway, but I am not somebody that’s reliant on the drug companies, and we call it big pharma. Big pharma is probably the most powerful lobbyist of any lobbyist there is probably. I don’t know. Maybe the lawyer’s lobby is pretty powerful, too. But big pharma would be just about up there. And we have to do what’s right. They’ve been talking about reducing drug prices ever since I can remember, ever since I’ve been starting to really watch politics with interest, which was actually at a very young age, but we’ve been talking about drug price reductions and prescription drug reductions. And I will tell you, you’re going to see the biggest reductions in the history of our country by many times. We’re not talking about a 1%. And as you know, last year for the first time in 51 years, drug prices went down marginally, but they went down. First time in 51 years. So I was president then drug prices went down first time at 51 years. Now you’re going to see numbers that you wouldn’t even believe. And it’s going to be fair. It’s not fair that other countries pay a fraction of, I mean a fraction of what we do. We pay all research and development and promotional costs and everything, it’s put onto the United States. They pay nothing. Nothing. And then on top of it, they say, “This is what we’ll pay and this is what it is.” And the United States will pay the remainder of the difference. I mean, this is the way they buy. They go, and I won’t mention names of countries, but they say, “This is what we’re going to pay. The United States will make up the difference.” And that’s not going to happen anymore. Okay. Thank you all very much. We appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you very much.

"24","08-01-20","Yeah. Go ahead. Please, go ahead. Yeah. Well, he did a bad job for minorities. I did much more for minorities than he did. And if you look at our numbers prior to the plague coming in, and those numbers will soon be back, you’ll see I did a much better job than Obama did by far for African Americans, for Asian Americans, for women, for anything group you look at, far better than Obama did. Yeah. Yeah, go ahead please. Well, we don’t want that to happen. [crosstalk 00:00:53] Yeah, we don’t want that to happen. But people have to come into our country legally. Right now we have 267 miles of wall. We’re doing very well on keeping the drugs out and keeping people out that aren’t supposed to be here. But people have to come into our country legally. [crosstalk 00:01:09] Go ahead. We’re taking a look at it very strongly. We’re working with representatives of DACA, and we’re also working on a big immigration bill, which is merit-based and something that people are going to be very happy with. We’re doing a very big immigration bill and we’re doing a very big healthcare bill. The other thing we’re working on very strongly, and it’s very important, is prescription drug prices. The drug companies are not exactly happy. In fact, I assume they’ll be taking ads. But we’re doing a drug prescription bill, in a sense. We’ve already signed it for the most part. One goes into effect very soon, that’s going to get us to be tied with or lower than the lowest drug prices anywhere in the world. Right now, the United States, because of what has happened over years, we have the highest prescription drug prices in the world. We will soon have the lowest. Go ahead, Jennifer. We’re looking at TikTok. We may be banning TikTok. We may be doing some other things. There are a couple of options, but a lot of things are happening. So we’ll see what happens. But we are looking at a lot of alternatives with respect to TikTok. About what? We're going to have a report for you tomorrow on that. So we ended a rule that was a very horrible rule for people in suburbia and the suburbs. That rule has been a very unfair rule for a long time, and it was going to be made a lot worse by Biden and Cory Booker. It’s a rule that basically you build low-income housing and you build other forms of housing. Also having to do with zoning and destroy people that have lived in communities in suburbia for years, they’ve lived there and they want to destroy their lives and destroy what they have. That has been going on for a long time. I ended the rule, so people living in the suburbs will no longer have that problem. Thank you. Thank you very much. Herman Cain was a great man. He did a fantastic job. He was respected by everybody. He was loved by everybody, and we will miss Herman Cain. No. I don't think he did, no. Thank you.
















"
"25","08-03-20","I want to start by providing information on our response to Tropical Storm Isaias. It’s a very interesting name. Last week, the storm hit Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, and I’ve issued emergency declarations to support our response in both of those areas. So that’s Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. This week, the storm passed just east of Florida. Got a little bit lucky, didn’t hit Florida too hard. Working with the governor, working with everybody, but it did not hit directly as a lot of people thought it might. It’s currently off the coast of South Carolina heading northward to North Carolina, is expected to make landfall sometime this evening as a Category 1 hurricane, very serious, a lot of water, a lot of water coming from that storm. I’ve already issued emergency declarations for Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, and FEMA’s personnel, and they are great, they’re doing a job. They’re already on the ground in all areas. Every single area that we mentioned just covered. Over the next several days, there’s expected to be heavy wind and rain in the coastal areas of North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, and New Jersey. We’re working with each of those states. And in particular, as it relates to FEMA, the military, law enforcement, all of the different groups that are involved, storm surge and inland flooding are possible and everyone needs to remain vigilant until it passes. I encourage everyone to follow the guidelines of the state and local authorities. We’re working with them. And I think the guidelines have been very accurate so far. So stay safe. Next let me provide an update on the path forward for our country as we continue our war to defeat the China virus. We’re beginning to see evidence of significant progress. Nationwide, the number of positive cases has declined by nearly 6% from the week before. And the positive test rate is also dropped from 8.7% to 8% over that same period of time, an encouraging sign, very encouraging. I have to add that the virus is receding in hotspots across the south and west. We’ve seen slow improvements from their recent weekly peaks. Arizona’s weekly case counts have dropped 37%. That’s a tremendous drop and the governor and the state have done a fantastic job, down 37%. Texas down 18.7%. I was there a couple of days ago. And Florida 21.2% drop. So that’s a tremendous job that they’re all doing. As we begin to contain the virus in these states, we must focus on new flare ups in the states where the case numbers have risen, including Georgia, Mississippi, Tennessee, Oklahoma, Missouri and I think you’ll find that they’re soon going to be very much under control. Meanwhile, 18 states continue to have very low case numbers and low test positivity rates under 5%: Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wyoming. It’s under five. Even in these states, however, where the virus is under control and at a very low number, Americans should continue to be vigilant, be careful in order to prevent the new hotspots from opening up or any new hotspots from opening up in those states. To that end, I urge all Americans to continue to socially distance, wash your hands, wear a mask when you cannot avoid crowded places and to protect the elderly. Very, very important, protect the elderly. It’s much different. Young children have very strong immune systems. We’ve learned how strong they are, but protect the elderly. The average age of those who succumb to the virus is 78 years old. That’s the average age. It’s important for all Americans to recognize that a permanent lockdown is not a viable path toward producing the result that you want, or certainly not a viable path forward and would ultimately inflict more harm than it would prevent. As we’re seeing in foreign countries around the world, where cases are once again surging, you have many places where we thought they were under control and doing a great job, and they are doing a great job, but this is a very tough invisible enemy. Lockdowns do not prevent infection in the future. They just don’t. It comes back, many times it comes back. The purpose of a lockdown is to buy time to build capacity, especially with respect to hospitals, learn more about the disease and develop effective treatments as we did in the United States. We’re doing very well with the vaccines and the therapeutics. Countries where there have been very significant flare ups over the last short period of time are Spain, Germany, France, Australia, Japan. And also, as you probably heard in Hong Kong, they’ve had some very serious flare ups. Japan has gone, yeah, a lot of six fold flare up. It’s a lot, but they’ll get it under control. In our current phase, we must focus on protecting those at highest risk while allowing younger and healthier Americans to resume work and school with careful precautions. Ideally, we want to open those schools. We want to open them. At the same time, we’re placing an emphasis on continuing to drive down the mortality rate with improved care, treatment and medical interventions, building a bridge to the introduction of a vaccine. The vaccines are coming along incredibly well. Today I’d like to also provide an update on the actions of my administration and the work that we’ve done. We’re really taking an increased interest and we’re seeing numbers that nobody can even believe in terms of percentage increase. It’s telehealth for American patients. The percentage increase is being worked on right now, but it’s very, very significant, numbers that you would not even think possible. This has been a priority from the beginning of my administration when we launched an initiative to allow veterans to connect remotely with their VA healthcare team. And it worked out really well. We have a 91% approval rating in the VA in terms of the job we’re doing. It’s the first, it’s the highest ever recorded. Now telehealth is a critical part of our path forward in the VA. And it’s becoming a critical path, especially with our senior citizens. You don’t have to go to the doctor’s office. You don’t have to go to hospitals. When the invisible enemy struck our shores, I took immediate action to eliminate regulatory barriers to telehealth, making it easier for patients to consult with doctors from safety and convenience, and really they have great safety and great convenience right from their homes. Today I’m taking action to ensure telehealth is here to stay. Moments ago in the Oval Office, I signed an executive order to make many of our regulatory reforms permanent. We’ve done some regulatory reforms that have had a tremendous impact on what we’re doing, on medicine and medical and what we’re doing. We can do things that you wouldn’t believe, that even a year ago, two years ago, would not have been doable. We’re enshrining the right of American patients to meet with their medical providers in a way that is best for them and very, very convenient and very talented people on the other side of the line, I have to tell you. The order builds upon a series of actions we’ve all taken to make telehealth available to all. We ensured that Medicare covers telehealth visits at no additional cost. That’s no additional cost. And copayments can be waived for telehealth services. We are working very hard also on prescription drug prices. And I will tell you that the Favorite Nations Clause that I’ve signed into existence, nobody thought anybody would ever do that, has a massive impact on prescription drug prices. In addition to the three other elements of reduction of drugs, particular prescription drugs, but the Favorite Nations Clause is massive. For instance, if Germany buys a pill for 25 cents a pill, as an example, just as an example, and the United States pays $2 for the same pill, we get the same privilege, the same right, as they do. Never had that before. We paid all of the expenses, all of the research and development. So the numbers are astronomical. And as you probably noticed, big ads are taken against me by big pharma, very big ads, very massive buy. But in the meantime, they’re calling, they want to know if they can make a deal. And I say to people, the only reason these ads are being taken is because prices are coming down for you. And they understand that. I think our people understand that. But in particular, when you look at the matching, you could call it matching, or you could call it Favorite Nations, call it whatever you like. It’s going to have a tremendous, and I’m talking about 50%, 60%, 70%. That doesn’t mean it goes to 25 cents, as an example, but theirs comes up and ours goes down. And you have many, many countries where the numbers are so low. I mean, it’s so low. And by that, I mean much lower than the United States. Another thing I’m doing is if a certain country like Canada, Canada buys for very much less than United States has bought. How they allowed this to happen, representatives of our country, standing at these podiums or in the Oval Office, how they allowed this to happen is just, to me, incredible. We’ve been working on this for a long time. I’ve been talking about it with Kayleigh for a long time, right? So now a governor like Ron DeSantis of Florida is doing a great job, or our great governor of Ohio, or our great governor of any state can call up and buy the drugs directly from Canada, at sometimes 50% less. So we’ll be buying from Canada. Now what the drug companies are going to do, maybe they’ll raise them, maybe they’ll lower them, or maybe they’ll just give up and sell them to us directly, much cheaper. So a lot of things that are happening. Also, the rebate, we have people that are very wealthy, that nobody ever heard of them, nobody knows who they are. I guess in some cases they can be pharmacies. In some cases, they’re individuals. We’re doing a rebate and the rebate goes to the people that lowers the price of drugs. So we have a series of four things that we signed, and you will see over a fairly short period, drug prices are going to be tumbling down, at numbers that nobody would have ever believed possible. In 51 years, the only time prices came down was during this administration. It was last year, 51 years, it went up. But that was just a small decline, this is a massive decline. This is a decline that nobody can believe. I was called by senators. I was called by congressmen, “Please don’t do this.” But big pharma doesn’t mean anything to me, other than we want them to do a great job. We want them to get their vaccines. We want them to do what has to be done. So I think you’re going to see drug price reductions over the next four or five or six months. Probably take a little while to kick in, then they’re going to be at numbers that you wouldn’t believe. But in the meantime, they called on Friday afternoon, they want to meet, see if they can do something else. They don’t like favorite nations clauses, I understand that. We vastly expanded coverage, allowing Medicare to cover more than 135 new services through telehealth, by the way, including physical therapy, emergency department visits, home visits, mental health counseling, substance abuse treatment, which is a very big priority. We brought the substance abuse, at least prior to the China plague or whatever you want to call it, we brought it down very substantially. Pediatric critical care and much more. Thanks to our actions, an estimated $2 billion of additional funding will support Medicare patients receiving telehealth services. So a very, very big priority on tele-health. As part of the CARES Act, we secured $200 million to help healthcare providers and hospitals expand their telehealth. And they’re all doing it, they’re doing it gladly. Prior to the epidemic or the pandemic, whatever you want to say and how you want to refer to it. But prior to the pandemic, the telehealth was fine, but it wasn’t anything raging. And I guess one of the only good things that we’ve gotten out of this whole horrible situation is telehealth has been incredible. And again, the increases are many hundreds of times greater than it was before. Do you have a number? It’s like 2000% or something like that. It’s an incredible increase. You’ll get the number, but it’s… I think they have it now finally. And it’s really an incredible… Thank you, Kayleigh. We work with the leaders of major health insurance companies to ensure coverage for the telehealth visits related to coronavirus. We cut red tape to allow many services to be conducted by phone rather than video, which is much simpler, providing a much easier option for many seniors in particular. 35% of the Medicare beneficiaries who received telehealth services, or over 3.6 million seniors, did so over the phone. So you’re talking about 3.6 million seniors, that’s something. 10.1 million Medicare beneficiaries have accessed care through telehealth since the beginning of the pandemic. So you’re talking there, 10.1 million people. In April, over 43% of all Medicare primary care visits were done via telehealth and compared to less than a 0.1% in February. Those are part of the numbers that I think I’ll have you get them. So this part you don’t have to, you’ll get the the other section. Thank you. So think of that, compared to less than 0.1%. 0.1%, that’s an incredible number. So over 43% of all Medicare primary care visits were done via telehealth compared to… So you went from 0.1% to 43%. It’s an incredible number. The executive order I signed today will also expand healthcare access in rural America. We take care of rural America. It directs agencies to deploy strategic investments in our rural communications infrastructure. And we’re working very hard with all of the people in government that are involved with the communications infrastructure, so that the telehealth gets very quick and easy access. Additionally, revenue for rural providers varies significantly from month to month, making it difficult for many to stay in business. Many, many are having a very difficult time. To help fix this problem, my order will create a voluntary Medicare payment system that will give rural hospitals flexibility, really great flexibility and a more consistent income stream to better serve their patients. Furthermore, I am directing the Department of Agriculture, Department of Health and Human Services and the Federal Communications Commission… We were just with the heads of each one in the Oval Office, just before I came up to the podium. To form a task force that will break down barriers to expanding rural healthcare. This order continues my administration’s focus on rural healthcare. We allocated nearly $165 million through the CARES Act to support nearly 1,800 small rural hospitals, who have done an incredible job, as well as $11.5 million to expand technical assistance for rural and underserved areas. We allocated another $10 billion to 2000 rural hospitals, and more than 2,400 rural health clinics. We waived burdensome licensing certification and registration requirements, which took tremendous amounts of time. And these are people that had great reputations and great track records, for practitioners that serve on the front lines in rural areas, allowing more medical personnel to serve their wonderful patients. We’re also, in terms of PPE, ensuring that the state and local areas have the supplies they need. We’ve been supplying hospitals and cities and states, governors, helping governors at a number that nobody’s ever heard of before. 15,440 nursing homes have received a second shipment of personal protective equipment. They’re very much stocked up. They’re in great shape. They all have the ventilators, all the ventilators they need. They have actually more than they need. And their medical equipment is in very, very good shape. They’re full. My administration has worked with the private sector to deliver over 100 million N95 respirators, 85 million gloves and nearly 250 million face coverings nationwide. We continue to make the extraordinary progress that we’ve been talking about together on vaccines and treatments under Operation Warp Speed, which is very exciting, most exciting. Last week we distributed 2,979 cases of remdesivir, which is proving to be extremely powerful and good, enough to treat more than 19,000 patients, had great results. This includes 500 cases for Florida, 500 for Texas, 300 for California, 200 for Ohio, and 150 for Arizona and Georgia. And those numbers will be going up rapidly as we move along. Hospitals are reporting an adequate supply of steroids, such as dexamethasone, that are used successfully in late stage illness. They’ve been very good. We’re also very encouraged about the prospects for plasma therapies that we’re working on. And that’s a brilliant art. It’s really an art. And we launched a national plasma drive last week. I was at the Red Cross building with the American Red Cross and 13 other healthcare organizations. I urge everyone who has recovered from the virus to go to coronavirus.gov, coronavirus.gov, and donate plasma today. We would really appreciate it. This really makes people better. But what we need is, we need that beautiful ingredient, that you that got better, seem to have in your veins, you have to go to coronavirus.gov and donate plasma today. It would be tremendous. We really appreciate it if you do it because we’re low. We’re low. We could help a lot more people, and it would be a terrific thing. It’ll take an hour, maybe a little bit more than an hour, but everybody will be very appreciative. It makes people better. You had something very special, you had something that knocked it out, so we want to be able to use it. So whatever you can do, coronavirus.gov. As a result of improvements we’ve made in treatment for Americans over the age of 18, the mortality rate has declined 85% from its April peak, 85% decline. On vaccines, last week we announced a $2.1 billion partnership with Sanofi and GSX to purchase and produce 100 million doses of their coronavirus vaccine, 100 million doses. This is the sixth vaccine candidate we are proactively supporting. We are supporting numerous companies that are doing very well, having wonderful results, and they’re in final stages of testing. There are now two vaccines in that final stage of clinical trials in America with a third vaccine likely to begin phase three almost immediately. We have additional clinical trials scheduled over the next few weeks for a couple of the other companies. These are great companies. These are companies that are not only well-known, they’re well-respected, most importantly. We’re balancing speed and safety, and we’re on pace to have a vaccine available this year, maybe far in advance of the end of the year. We’re mass producing the most promising candidates in advance so that we’re ready immediately upon approval. We have our military lined up. It’s logistics. It’s all about logistics. They deliver a lot of things, including soldiers, but now they’ll be doing vaccine. Our general is all ready to go, and he’s very excited. Once we have the vaccine approved, fully approved, he’ll start the process. They will start the process, and they’ll get it out very, very quickly all over the country, and maybe beyond if it works as we think it probably will. By unleashing America’s technical and scientific brilliance, we will end this pandemic, and we will hopefully end it very quickly. The therapeutics are very exciting to me, where you can go into a hospital, and whether it’s through a shot or a transfusion, you take care of somebody and they get better. That’s something to me that’s very important. We’re doing really well on therapeutics and really well on vaccines. So thank you all very much for being here. We’ll take a couple of questions. They’re actually briefing me in a little while. We have it scheduled for a little while from now. Oh, it’s terrible. No, it’s terrible, and we’ll be in contact with the families. A thing like that is terrible. Well, I just heard about it. This is just a continuation of the witch hunt. It’s Democrat stuff. They failed with Mueller. They failed with everything. They failed with Congress. They failed at every stage of the game. This has been going on for three and a half, four years. Even before I got in, this was starting with the Mueller deal. Mueller started a little bit after, but it started with some of the people that you know very well the names, Strzok and Page and all of the different people, Comey. This has been going on. This is a continuation of the worst witch hunt in American history, and there’s nothing that I know even about it. I had seen that today just a little while ago. I said, “What’s this all about?” I know nothing about it, but it’s just a continuation of the witch hunt. Didn’t work out for Congress, didn’t work out for Mueller, didn’t work out for anybody. So what they’re doing is they send them around to all over the country, I guess maybe, but it’s a terrible thing that they do. It’s really a terrible thing. The witch hunt has gone on long enough. What else? Absolutely not. Absolutely. It’s possible that I get involved; but no, it won’t have anything to do with … We want to make people better. We want to send them to the areas that most need it, and I think we’re going to have something very soon. It’s going good. Jeff. I think we’re doing very well, and I think that we have done as well as any nation. If you really look, if you take a look at what’s going on, especially now with all these flareups and nations that they were talking about. Don’t forget, we’re much bigger, other than India and China. China’s having a massive flareup right down. India has a tremendous problem. Other countries have problems. I noticed that in the news, in the evening news, I never read about that in any of the news. I don’t read about the other countries. You’re starting to see that other countries are having very big flareups, countries that thought they were over it. Like we thought we might be over it in Florida; and then all of a sudden, it comes back. They do come back, but I think we’re doing very well. I told Dr. Birx, I think we’re doing very well. She was in my office a little while ago. She’s a person I have a lot of respect for. I think Nancy Pelosi’s treated her very badly, very, very badly, very nasty. I’m just referring to the fact that I thought that really they should say the job we’ve done, whether it’s on ventilators or testing, we’ve tested now over 60 million people. No other country is even close to that. We’ve tested 60 million people with great … In many cases, about 50% now, rapid fire, meaning 5 to 15 to 20-minute tests, where you get the result almost immediately. Nobody has anything like that. Nobody. I think we’re just doing very well. Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead, please. Go ahead, please. Either way, whether it’s Microsoft or somebody else, or it was the Chinese. What the price is, the United States should get a very large percentage of that price because we’re making it possible. Without us, I use the expression, it’s like the landlord and the tenant. Without the lease, the tenant doesn’t have the value. Well, we’re in a certain way, the lease. We make it possible to have this great success. TikTok’s a tremendous success, but a big portion of it’s in this country. It would come from the sale. Yeah, whatever the number is, it would come from the sale,-which nobody else would be thinking about, but me. But that’s the way I think. I think it’s very fair. But we want no security problems with China. It’s got to be an American company. It’s got to be American security. It’s got to be owned here. We don’t want to have any problems with security, etc. Something could come out. I will tell you, there’s a lot of excitement, not only by Microsoft, but by other companies in terms of buying it. We’ll see what happens, but we want, and we think we deserve, to have a big percentage of that price coming to America, coming to the Treasury. I might do that. Yes. Yeah, I can do that if I want, and I want to do that. I don’t want people to be evicted. When they’re evicted, when they’re thrown out of whatever the place may be, in many cases, they go to big shelters. If you talk about pandemic, this is a pandemic, and they go to shelters. Number one, they’re thrown out viciously. It’s not their fault. It’s China’s fault. It’s not anybody’s fault. It’s China’s fault. But number two, and if they are thrown out, they oftentimes will go to a shelter with tremendous numbers of other people, and the virus will spread. We don’t want that. Well, I can do that also through an executive order. So we’ll be talking about that. But we’re having a very good discussion with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. The problem is they want to do bailouts of their various Democrat-run states and cities. They want a lot of money. They want a trillion dollars for that. They want to do much more than COVID-related. They want to bail out cities and states that have been in trouble for years of bad management. In all cases, Democrat-run cities, and we don’t think that’s fair. You understand that. You’ve heard it before. Yeah, please. Go ahead. It’s not a mass send, but it’s sending very talented people to help them with the drugs and the shootings and the guns and the things that are happening. It’s not like sending in the National Guard and stopping it cold, which is an example. A lot of progress has been made in Portland, but you know, frankly, sending in the National Guard like we did in Minneapolis, it stopped it cold. From the time we sent that National Guard, they walked down the street, it was over in Minneapolis. Now it may be starting up again. These are Democrat run cities and states and it hasn’t been a pretty picture to watch. We will help Chicago. We’ll help New York if they request. They have to request the help but we want to stop the drugs. We want to stop the guns. A lot of the Chicago is guns and what it is, is drug related; gang related, largely gang related. With ICE, we send out thousands of MS-13. Thousands and thousands of MS-13. We send them back or in some cases have to put them in prison. They’re too violent. They’re truly violent. So we’re helping out. When you look at what’s happening in Chicago and some other cities with the shootings and the killings, they need help and we haven’t met with resistance, I have to be honest with you. I think it’s good that we haven’t. We’re only looking to help them. We’re only looking to help. Well, there’s never been a push like this for mail-in ballots and if you look at the New York congressional race, which is a disaster. Carolyn, it’s been a total disaster. They’re six weeks into it. Now they have no clue what’s going on and I mean, I think I can say right here and now I think you have to rerun that race because it’s a mess. Nobody knows what’s happening with the ballots and the lost ballots and the fraudulent ballots, I guess. I think you’ve probably have to take the Carolyn Maloney race and run it over again. How can you do this? This is a small race with literally thousands of people, small thousands, and it’s all messed up. You look at Patterson, New Jersey. It’s all messed up. Almost every one of these and these are small, easy to control. They should be able to do this easy. Now you’re talking about like Nevada, where last two nights ago, they went out and in the darkness of night without people, without having any meetings of the public, without having anything, they approved the ridiculous you don’t have to look at signatures. You don’t have to approve anything. You can have double mailings. You can have all sorts of things. Nobody’s ever seen anything like it. It’s a disgrace. I mean, honestly, it’s a disgrace. So it’s a very good question. I mean, the mail in ballots, if you look at just some of the small places, the small races, congressional race in New York, should be very easy. Normally that would have been announced at seven o’clock and it would have been down to the wire and everybody would have loved it. If it was at all complex, it would have taken an extra 45 minutes or an hour. They would have announced it a little bit later. They have no clue. This was about six weeks ago and they have no clue what’s going on. They’ve lost ballots. There’s fraudulent ballots. It’s how are you going to do you do that for an entire nation? They’re using COVID to try and get the mail-in ballots. Now, absentee ballots are great. Absentee ballots, you have to request them. They go through a process. They get them. But the universal mail-in ballots have turned out to be a disaster. What Nevada has been doing, if you look over the last few days, you have to look at what they’ve done. You can have two ballots. You can harvest; it’s harvesting. So you can take thousands of ballots, put them together and just dump them down on somebody’s desk after a certain period of time. They have something where if you vote, the vote can count up to seven days later. Well, if the vote is going to count seven days later, that means, if it depends on the one state like Nevada, that would mean simply that you can’t have, supposing it’s down to that one state, it could be. It’s a great state. But supposing is down to that one state. That means you have to wait seven days but they won’t have it there. This is something that’s so messed up. By the way, I have to say the post office for many, many years has been run in a fashion that hasn’t been great. Great workers and everything but they have old equipment, very old equipment. I don’t think the post office is prepared for a thing like this. You have to ask the people at the post office but how can the post office be expected to handle? They have regular mailing and then now on top of that, they have the internet where you have Amazon and these companies doing all the buying instead of going to a department store, they go buy through mail. So you have massive numbers of purchases now going through the post office, purchases of items and gifts and that’s a tremendous strain on the post office. The post office loses a fortune. It has been for many, many years, for decades. So now on top of it, it has this and the Amazons of the world and the others they pay very, very little money. They lose money on every… The post office loses money which is ridiculous on every package that delivers. Now, on top of that, and I’m not just referring to Amazon, I’m talking about all of the competitors, if there is such a thing to Amazon. It will be. But if there is such a thing, but now on top of that, you’ll have somebody like the governor of Nevada, come out with this massive plan out of nowhere to take millions of ballots and send them all over the place. You’ll never know who won that state. It’ll get messed up just like New York and just like Patterson, New Jersey, and just like many other places. In West Virginia, they indicted a postman for doing something very bad, you know that, but there are many cases all over the country. If you look, you’ll be able to find there’s a list of them all over the country and that has to do with universal mailing. Again, absentee is great. It works. Like in Florida, they’ll do absentee. It really works but universal mail-in ballots is going to be a great embarrassment to our country. Well, I have the right to do it. We haven’t gotten there yet, but we’ll see what happens. We will be suing in Nevada and that’s already been taken care of. We’ll probably file something tomorrow. I do want to say that we’re going to be introducing a tremendous healthcare plan sometime prior, hopefully prior to the end of the month. It’s just about completed now. In addition, next month we’ll be doing the immigration plan. So we’ll be doing that in September. We’ll be doing sometime during this month, the healthcare plan and I think that’ll be before the end of the month and I think it will be very impressive to a lot of people. Thank you very much.
















"
"26","08-04-20","Let me begin by sending America’s deepest sympathies to the people of Lebanon, where reports indicate that many, many people were killed. Hundreds more were very badly wounded in a large explosion in Beirut. Our prayers go out to all the victims and their families. The United States stands ready to assist Lebanon. We have a very good relationship with the people of Lebanon and we will be there to help. It looks like a terrible attack. I also want to provide the latest on tropical storm Isaias. Approximately 600,000 are without power along the East coast and utility companies are working around the clock to restore service as quickly as possible. I spoke to governor Cooper. I spoke to governor DeSantis and I spoke to all of the people at FEMA and they’re working very hard. Coastal areas in the storm’s path can expect to see the storm surge and rip currents. While inland areas could see flooding and very, very high winds. FEMA is responding to states that have requested the assistance. We have a list of those states we can give them to you in a little while and my administration is monitoring the situation very closely. We have the military on guard, but we have FEMA is there in all cases. Corps of engineer is ready if needed, the army Corps of engineers, very talented people. I urge everyone in the storm’s path to remain alert and to follow the guidance of your state and local authorities. I now want to update you on the path forward having to do with the China virus. Before I do that, I want to give you some numbers which are rather spectacular that just came out. The manufacturing index of the Institute for supply management, that’s ISM. Most of you know it by ISM, increased for the third month in a row rising nearly two points in July to 54.2. That was fantastic. The highest reading since March of 2019, this is remarkable considering the survey was conducted throughout July and showed significant improvement despite the Southwest in particular virus hotspots. The ISM measures and it’s a very strong measure. New orders rose five points in July to 61.5 and its highest reading that would be since September of 2018, that’s a big number. Since the April load new orders are up over 34 points, which is the largest increase in the history of the ISM dating back all the way to 1948. So 34 points that’s the largest since 1948. Similarly, the ISM’s measure of production is up 35 points from its April low to a reading of 62.1, which is the largest three month gain in over 70 years. That’s some number. These were somewhat surprising, but I’ve been saying we’re doing well and those numbers are really spectacular. Automobile sales likewise are a key factor in the resurgence of manufacturing since the March low of 8.8 million units with sales and all of the numbers that are going up stunningly. At 65% increase since then two 14.5 million units, which is a massive number. The great strength and great news is really four states like in particular, Michigan and Ohio, South Carolina, Pennsylvania, very good. Florida, little bit. These are great numbers, record setting numbers. The strength of new car sales is also evident in the used car market where soaring demand, literally soaring demand is putting upward pressure on the used car prices. This is a leading indicator of the motor vehicle industry. The need to restock depleted shelves will further galvanize the factory sector. And we think very substantially based on the numbers we’re very, very happy with these numbers. And I think most people are anywhere from surprised to shocked by these numbers in a very positive way. Economy-wide inventories crashed at a near $320 billion annualized rate last quarter. Crash in that case means a good thing, not a bad thing. That’s the largest drop ever on record ever. Home builder sentiment likewise is soaring as our home sales sentiment is now higher than last year. New homes recently made a 13 year high. So we have a 13 year high in new home construction. New business applications are very strong that just came out. The widely followed Atlanta fed GDP and it’s something that they have just come out with now. Forecasts see new data point and incorporates it into quarterly estimates. It looks like it’s showing a 20% annualized growth in the current quarter. So 20% in the current quarter, we’ll take that all day long. Let’s see if that’s right, that’s a projection. So we’ll see if that’s right. The Atlanta fed very respected. The virus, back to that, we are continuing to monitor and monitor a particular hotspots across the South Southwest and the West. And we’re seeing indications that our strong mitigation efforts are working very well actually. Especially to protect those who are most at risk, which has really been our primary focus for ever since we’ve gotten to understand this horrible plague that’s been unleashed in our country by China. As of yesterday cases are declining in 70% of the jurisdictions compared to 36% last Monday. That’s a big, big number. 11 out of 13 states with the positive rate above 10% have seen a decline in daily cases since mid-July. In other states, the data suggests that the need for continuing vigilance always strong, even though the numbers are getting very good. States that have a test positivity rate between five and 10% and in the states with the lowest positivity rates, we also see slight increases in daily cases in a couple of them. We must ensure that these states do not become new flare ups so we’re watching them very, very closely. Fortunately, thanks to substantial improvements in treatment and the knowledge we have gained about the disease itself the recent rise in cases has not been accompanied by a significant increase in deaths. Fatalities nationwide are at roughly half the level of the April peak. So the number of deaths or fatalities are at half the level. One is too much, one death because it should have never happened to us. It should have been stopped very easily by China in Wuhan. Thanks to our major advances in treatment we’ve seen vast improvements in recovery rates across all age groups. Compared to April mortality rates are 85% lower among individuals aged 18 to 69 and 70% lower among individuals over 70 years old. We’ve also made significant strides in sheltering those at highest risk, especially the elderly. Approximately 85% of all current cases are individuals under the age of 65. Just getting some very accurate numbers on this. And these are people who are generally at a much lower risk of complications. Since the pandemic began nearly half of all fatalities have been at nursing homes or assisted living centers. That’s an incredible statistic when you hear that number. This data underscores that the best path forward is an aggressive strategy focused on protecting Americans at highest risk as we race toward the development of a vaccine, we must continue to take extraordinary precautions to shield the elderly. And we’re doing that. We’re doing that at a level that we’ve never even dreamt possible, both with testing and with common sense. And those with underlying conditions, especially the elderly with the underlying, whether it’s heart or diabetes. They seem to be the two most predominant conditions that cause tremendous problems. While allowing those at lowest risk to carefully return to work and to school Where embers flare up, we must engage immediately. And that’s what we’re doing. This is the science based approach. And it’s good with us, working very hard on that. An extended lockdown would fail to target resources at the highest risk populations while inflicting massive economic pain, long lasting damage on society and public health as a whole. So there won’t be locked downs, but we watch specific areas. We’re very careful and we’re putting out embers. We’re putting out flames. When you look at what’s happening with Miami and it’s going, the numbers are going down, but Florida is going down very significantly. Texas and California are going down rather significantly. On telemedicine as we discussed the last time, and as I said numerous times during this day, it’s an incredible thing that’s happening. A central part of our effort to protect the elderly is to greatly expand access to telehealth. So seniors can be treated from the safety of their homes and that’s what’s happening. The number of Medicare beneficiaries using telehealth increased from roughly 14,000 a week to nearly 1.7 million. So from 14,000 to 1.7 million per week in total. 10 million Medicare beneficiaries have accessed telehealth services since the pandemic began. That’s a tremendous thing that’s happened with telehealth. As we shelter those at high risk, we are also pouring every resource at our disposal into the development of therapies and vaccines. Two vaccine candidates are currently in the final stage of clinical trials with several more vaccine candidates entering phase three in the coming weeks. And you’ve read and seen what’s happened today. Today’s news was very exciting. Through operation warp speed we’re also mass producing all of the most promising vaccine candidates, and we’re determined to have a vaccine very quickly with it. We’re going to have something very soon. We have great companies. These are among the greatest companies in the world. But right now they don’t like me so much because I’m forcing them to drop drug prices, prescription drug prices vary massively. Some of these companies are involved in that. Some of them aren’t. We’re having a tremendous… You’ll see a tremendous drop in price. We’re using favored nations. We’re using the rebates. We’re using everything. So long I’ve heard about how wealthy the middlemen are. They call them the middlemen and they are very wealthy. Nobody even knows who they are, but they’re very wealthy people. That we’re doing the rebates. We’re doing purchases from other countries like Canada, which buys drugs for much less money than the United States is allowed to under a very bad system. I don’t call it archaic. I call it bad because it’s meant really for drug companies to get higher prices. But under the system of matching that we have, if Germany has a pill for 25 cents and ours is $2, we’re allowed to say, “We want favored nations. And we want the pill for the same, the same as the lowest country in the world.” If they sell to one country lower than anybody else, that’s the price we’re going to get. Drug companies aren’t too happy about that, big pharma. We’ve also dramatically accelerated the availability of plasma therapies, steroid treatments, antivirals, and other therapies to treat the illness. Today, the NIH were very exciting, announced that they’re beginning the trial of two new antibody treatments, which will take place in 40 cities across the country. We’re going to move very quickly. Results look very good, already, incredible results. More than 230 clinical trials for potential treatments are underway. And we’ve secured 500,000 courses of treatment for remdesivir. We’re really doing a job with it and it’s helping a lot of people. That’s why you see the fatalities and mortality numbers looking very good, relatively speaking, that is. But that’s for American hospitals through the month of September. So we have remdesivir at a very high level for hospitals through the month of September. That’s big news. The United States also has far and away, the most robust testing capacity in the world. Testing has been incredible, what we’ve been able to do. Nobody’s even close. Since March 12th, we’ve increased daily testing by 32,000%. How’s that? 32,000%. Somebody would say that must be a typo. It’s not a typo, 32,000%. We now have conducted over 61 million tests nationwide averaging over 820,000 tests per day and nearly five million tests per week. And now that we’re understanding the virus, we’re understanding very much what we’re doing with respect to who it affects, who it’s destroying and who gets away with it, like young people, very young people. We’ll be having some interesting statements having to do with testing and focus testing. I call it focus testing. By comparison, Mexico, so we’re doing numbers that are incredible, but by comparison, Mexico, as you know, the president was here. He’s a great guy, but their numbers are much different. They do about 1 million tests. France has done 2.9 million tests. Canada’s around the 4 million mark. Australia is around the 4 million mark. The United States is testing more people in a single week than. In many cases, large segments or large well known countries, all put together. It’s been an amazing achievement, the testing and the quality of the testing also. And now we’re doing testing where you can have results in five minutes, seven minutes, and 15 minutes, as opposed to waiting for it to come back from labs. Over the last several weeks, HHS has opened surging testing sites in Baton Rouge, New Orleans, Phoenix, Miami, Jacksonville, Florida, McAllen, Texas, Bakersfield, California. And this week we’re opening new surge sites in Houston, Texas, Atlanta. To date more than 130,000 tests have been conducted at these sites. Last week, the FDA also authorized the first two tests that display an estimated quantity of antibodies present in the individual’s blood, which is a big deal, allowing us to learn more about the immune response. FEMA and HHS has worked with the private sector to deliver more than… We have new numbers… More than 200 million N95 masks, 855 million surgical masks, 36 million goggles and face shields, 364 million gowns and coveralls and 21 billion gloves, billion. Can you believe that billion gloves? And we distribute that to the governors, different states. And when we get on the phone with them, they’re very happy. That I can tell you. No complaints from any of them. They’re very, very happy. What they say to you separately maybe will change for political reasons, but they are very happy with the job we’ve done. In our national stockpile, we’ve tripled the number of N95 masks on hand to more than 40 million, tripled the number of gowns to 15 million and quadrupled the number of ventilators to nearly 70,000. These numbers are growing every day. And we’re now making thousands of ventilators, many thousands of ventilators a month. And we’re getting them to other countries who are desperately in need of ventilators. They are very hard to produce. They’re very complicated machines. So we’re fully stocked here and we’ve made sure that every state is fully stocked, but we’re getting them to a lot of countries that need help. We’ll continue to work with the governors and local authorities to help them ensure significant hospital capacity, protective equipment, supplies, and medicine. I’m more confident than ever that we will get a vaccine very soon and we will defeat the virus. And I want to thank you all for being here. We’ll take a few questions. Yeah. I want to thank you all for being here. We’ll take a few questions. Yeah, please. No, I don’t know. I wasn’t involved in the deal. The concept of the deal is good, but I’ll let you know. We’ll do a little study on that. We’ll find out. If there is any problem, we’ll let you know about it very quickly, but I wasn’t involved in it. It’s a big deal. It’s a way of bringing back a great area too, in addition to pharmaceuticals. Kodak has been a great name, but obviously pretty much in a different business. And so we’ll see what that’s all about, but we’ll let you know very quickly. Yeah, please. Well, it would seem like it based on the explosion. I’ve met with some of our great generals and they just seem to feel that it was. This was not some kind of a manufacturing explosion type of event. This was seems to be, according to them, they would know better than I would, but they seem to think it was a attack. It was a bomb of some kind. Yes. Well, I think actually the numbers are lower than others. I’ll get back to you on that, but we proportionately are lower than almost all countries. We’re at the bottom of the list. And we’re relative to cases also, we’re at the bottom of the list, which is a good thing being at the bottom of the list, but I can get back to you. We have about four or five different lists on that. And we’re generally speaking at the very bottom of the list. So I’ll get back to you. Well, a lot of our numbers were based on the New York, had a very tough time as you know. New York, New Jersey, that area. And when you take them out, just as an example, take a look at Florida relative to New York. That’s not to say anything wrong with New York. It was just a very tough place. People are close together, it’s crowded. It’s not easy. But when you take that out, our numbers are among the lowest. And even with it in, I will get back to you but we have among the lowest numbers. They’ve done a fantastic job with it. Yeah. Go ahead. Yes. We are looking at it. We’re also looking at various other things that I’m allowed to do under the system and such as the payroll tax suspension. And so we’re allowed to do things. We’re talking with the Democrats. They seem to be much more interested in solving the problems of some of the Democrat run states and cities that have suffered greatly through bad management. I mean really bad management. So that seems to be where they … They’re looking for a trillion dollars to help out with cities that are run by Democrats. In some case, radical left Democrats that have not done a good job. I appreciate today the Wall Street Journal said very good things that we did a great job in Portland by having our people go in Homeland Security. Chad Wolf and the folks, we went into Portland and we’ve done a great job. And they had that in an editorial that we really won that situation. But we want the whole … We did save the courthouse. The courthouse was going to be burned down or knocked down. It was in tremendous danger. We went in, we took care of it and we appreciated what the Wall Street Journal said. As far as the various things that I may or may not sign, I may not have to sign. I mean, progress is being made as you know, very well in the hill. We’ll see what happens. But I have the right, including the payroll tax suspension. We may do some things. We want to take care of the eviction problem. People are being evicted very unfairly. It’s not their fault. It’s China’s fault. It’s not their fault. And people are being evicted and we can do that with an executive order. So if we don’t get … And we want to do it relatively quickly. I mean, even from the standpoint of COVID, people get evicted and then they go into shelters and there are thousands of people in the shelters, and this is not a time … You never want to be in a shelter, but this is not a time to be in a shelter with the COVID. They catch it, they get it and it’s no good. So I may have to do something on evictions too because the Democrats amazingly don’t want to do it. We offered them short term deals and we offered them lots of alternatives. But so far, the only thing they really want to do is bail out states that have been poorly managed by Democrats. Okay. Did you say that's impressive? Did you actually use that term? Oh. Well, it’s almost the same thing. Not quite. I like impressive. I like impressive. Not quite but close. So tick tack. TikTok is very successful. It does tremendous business in the United States. People are riveted by it. I mean, I have many friends, when they saw that announcement, that calling, I think their kids love it. They don’t because they don’t get to see their kids anymore, but they are … It’s an amazing thing, whatever it may be. And I told Microsoft and frankly others, if they want to do it, if they make a deal for TikTok, whether it’s the 30% in the United States or the whole company, I say, it’s okay. But if you do that, we’re really making it possible because we’re letting you operate here. So the United States treasury would have to benefit also, not just the sellers. And I said, inform-Very simple. I mean, we have all the cards because without us, you can’t come into the United States. It’s like, if you’re a landlord and you have a tenant, the tenant’s business needs rent. It needs a lease. And so what I said to them is whatever the price is, a very big proportion of that price would have to go to the treasury of the United States. And they understood that and actually they agreed with me. I mean, I think they agreed with me very much. Yeah, please in the back. So that deal may or may not happen. We’ve given them till September 15th or so. And we’ll see if we can have it and if they can be great security, meaning the obvious security, Microsoft would be a company that would be good in that respect or approved in that respect at many levels, including working with the Department of Defense and they’re very high level approvals. So it would be good. But there are the companies also. Yes please. No we’ve had other companies call us. Microsoft called me directly and we’ve had other companies call. I don’t know where they are. It sounds like Microsoft is along the way of doing something. I don’t blame them. It would be … It’s a great company. It’s really a great company, but we cannot take the security risks of any of those companies, including [Walway 00:26:40], which as you know, we put a halt to. But we can’t take the security risk. I think our attitude on China has changed greatly since the China virus hit us. I think it changed greatly. It hit the world and it shouldn’t have. They should have been able to stop it. So we feel differently. I just don’t know. When you lose so many thousands of people and ultimately it’ll be millions of people around the world. It’s a terrible thing that happened to the United States and Europe and the entire world. Really a terrible thing. Yes, please. We do more testing than anybody in the world, as I explained. And I don’t mean just a little bit. If you look at India, they’re at about 11 million. We’re at 61 million. And, there comes a point when you just, you want to focus your testing in a different way and we’ll be announcing stuff. What we’ve done is incredible with the testing. Not only the testing, not only the number of tests, but also very importantly, the quality of the test and the machinery itself to do the test. Nobody thought it would be possible to get a five- minute and a 15-minute result. That’s a very accurate result, and we do with Abbott. Abbott Laboratories has done a great job. Many of these companies have done an incredible job. So we’re looking at that very strongly. And we’re looking at doing something that if we do it… Look, right now, what the testing is doing is helpful, but we’re spending massive amounts of money and we want to have it channeled very accurately. We want to be able to help the most people we can. But, we are testing at a level that no country in the world, and I’ve spoken to the leaders of the world and they’ll ask me about it. No country in the world thought it would be it’s even believable that we’re able to test so much. 61 million versus, you know, most countries don’t even test. You know when they test? When somebody is feeling badly. If somebody is feeling badly, they’re symptomatic, that’s when they test. And that’s a big difference. With us we go around and looking because if we find spots, we find hotspots. One problem is from the standpoint of the media, we end up with far more cases than we would normally show. So it’s, you know, as I called it the other day in a statement I said, “It’s called media gold.” You know, for the media, it’s gold. But the truth is it’s… We’ve done an incredible job in testing. Nobody in the world has done the job. Other leaders have told me the same thing. They can’t believe we’re able to do it. And we will continue, but we want to really be able to test very specifically the people that are in most danger, most in need. Okay, I'm glad you're asking. So, Florida’s got a great Republican governor and it had a great Republican governor, Scott. Ron DeSantis, Rick Scott, two great governors. And over a long period of time, they’ve been able to get the absentee ballots done extremely professionally. Florida is different from other states. I mean, in Nevada, we have a governor, he said, “Let’s just send out millions of ballots.” And the post office cannot be prepared. I haven’t spoken to the post office about it, but I don’t know how they could possibly be prepared. Florida has been working on this for years and they have a very good system of mail-in and that would be absentee or even beyond absentee. So in the case of Florida, there aren’t too many people that would qualify, they’re so well-run. Florida’s a very well run state, low taxes, low everything. They’ve done a great job, really a great job. And the two governors, between the both of them, they’ve really got a great system of absentee ballots and even in the case of mail-in ballots. The postal services are built up there. You know, it takes a long time. When you look at the Carolyn Maloney election, I think they… And, I’ll give you the story. I think you have to do that election over. That election is no good. You have to take a look. In New York, they have thousands of ballots. They don’t know what happened to them. Is there fraud? Is there… It’s a disaster. That’s only for a relatively small number of ballots, but I think they have to do the election in New York over. The Times wrote a big story about it yesterday, front page story. It’s a disaster. It’s a mess. And they have to do that… I think they have to do that election over. Nobody can know what the election result is. So, in the case of Florida, they’ve done a great job. They’ve had tremendous success with it, but they’ve been doing this over many years and they’ve made it really terrific. So for Florida, you can mail in your ballots. You don’t have to go. In maybe a couple of other states they’ve worked out a system, but this took years to do. This doesn’t take weeks or months. In the case of Nevada, they’re going to be voting in a matter of weeks. And you can’t do that. I can’t imagine the post office could do it. All of a sudden they’re supposed to be dealing in millions of ballots, but Florida has done a great job. And we have total confidence that if you mail in your ballot in Florida, it’s going to matter. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you very much.

"27","08-05-20","… escape China. My administration has enacted $3 trillion in economic relief. It’s been very, very successful and you saw that by the numbers that were issued yesterday and the day before as to used car sales and auto production. They’ve been incredible numbers, actually. Shockingly incredible. We’ve been negotiating in good faith with Democrat leaders in the house to extend relief payments. We’re negotiating right now as we speak and we’ll see how that works out. But if Democrat leaders put partisan demands aside, we would reach an agreement very quickly. It would happen very quickly. In the meantime, my administration’s exploring executive actions to provide protections against eviction. Eviction is a big problem, very unfair to a lot of people. It wasn’t their fault that this virus came from a far away land. As well as additional relief to those who are unemployed as a result of the virus. Very importantly, I’m also looking at a term limited suspension of the payroll tax. Something that has great support from many, many sides, especially some of our top economists and some people that we have great respect for. So we’re looking at a suspension of the payroll tax. The Democrats are primarily interested in a $1 trillion bailout of the poorly run states. We have some states in cities, you know them all. We don’t have to go through names. But they’ve been very poorly run over the years and we can’t go along with the bailout money. We’re not going to go along with that, especially since it’s not COVID related. Earlier today, I met with a great governor. Arizona governor, Doug Ducey, has really done a fantastic job beyond even the COVID situation, which you’ve been reading about as it pertains to Arizona. A state that is a model for applying a science-based approach to the decreasing cases and hospitalizations without implementing a punishing lockdown. Arizona’s record in reducing the spread of the virus while maintaining hospital capacity and allowing society to continue functioning and functioning very nicely, very successfully is an example that shows how our path forward can work in other states. Arizona has a record and a record really to be proud of. It’s reduced the number of daily new cases by over 75%, cut the positivity rate in half and reduced ER visits by two thirds, all the while keeping the economy functioning and functioning really well. When cases surged in June, the vice president and Dr. Burke visited Arizona to consult with Governor Ducey. They had long consultations with Governor Ducey and his staff, and the vice president has been in constant contact ever since. My administration is also collaborating with the state and local officials across the South and Midwest to provide similar guidance. We had a great relationship with the representatives in Arizona, and it’s been such a successful endeavor. The federal government has supplied or delivered more than 400 million pieces of personal protective equipment to Arizona, along with nearly 70,000 vials of remdesivir. We’ve provided over $18 billion in economic support to Arizona, including more than $8.6 million to support over 80,000 small businesses. So we really have been helping Arizona and it’s gotten tremendous results. Our goal is to protect the most vulnerable, increase recovery rates, you know that. It’s something so important, and prevent hospital overcrowding all the while avoiding the kind of stringent lockdowns that would inflict substantial suffering. In the phase and this phase of the battle, we have the tools, resources and knowledge to implement a targeted approach, as we race to deliver a vaccine. And we are really working very hard on the vaccine and I think they’re doing a fantastic job. I’ve been meeting with officials of some of the greatest companies in the world and meeting with scientists. And they’re getting very close. If not there, they’re getting very close. They’re testing. Any proper analysis of infection control measures must take into account the short term and long term public health harms, including deaths caused by a far reaching shutdown. When you shut down, you have many, many things that happen. From suicides, to depression, to drinking, alcohol problems, to drug problems, to problems with marriages. Problems with marriages. You have people confined to their house, their apartment for long periods of time, you cause a lot of problems with that also. Instead, Arizona’s adopted the following measures. The governor advised residents to aggressively social distance when possible and maintain strict hygiene. The state encourage mask use in crowded public places, especially when social distancing is not possible. The governor also exercised his discretion to restrict capacity at indoor locations to limit the possibility of super spreading. It’s a big thing. My administration has urged treatments. We got them a lot of treatments and therapies to the state, including nearly 70,000 vials of remdesivir, enough to treat over 11,000 patients. And it’s been very successful, I might add. My administration also delivered PPE and point-of-care testing to over 100 Arizona nursing homes. In total, the federal government has provided massive amounts of masks and equipments and gowns, and you know some of those numbers. But Arizona was a very big beneficiary and they very much really appreciated. More than 1000 national guard and medical personnel have also been deployed in Arizona and they’ve really helped. They’ve been terrific and I want to thank them. They have been brave and brilliant, combination of both. We also supported our tribal communities. The tribal communities were hit very, very hard. Governor Ducey and I personally delivered rapid testing systems to the Navajo Nation, which has been really, really in originally bad shape and now getting better and very, very quickly. The Navajo Nation now has one of the highest levels of testing per capita, anywhere in the world. We really worked very hard on the tribal areas and in particular, in this case, the Navajo Nation. They’ve done incredibly well. Overall, Arizona has conducted over 1.1 million tests, more than the entire nations of Japan, Mexico, and Switzerland. Arizona’s per capita testing is higher than Germany, South Korea, France, and Canada, and tribal governments in Arizona have received nearly $1.3 billion for the coronavirus relief fund. Meanwhile, outdoor dining, limited indoor dining and most of the other businesses in Arizona have remained open and very vibrant. They’re doing incredibly well. This is an approach and it’s an approach that’s been incredibly successful. Arizona’s been able to protect high risk populations and quickly bring its outbreak under control without the need to impose overly punitive measures. Thanks to advances in treating the virus, the fatality rate across all age groups in Arizona is very low. Arizona’s scientific and data-driven strategy also preserved hospital capacity, ensuring that those who need care were able to receive it and receive it immediately, very quickly. At the peak, approximately 15% of beds remained available statewide. That was at that peak, with roughly 20% of all occupied beds going to patients hospitalized for the virus. They kept other things going. They kept other forms of operations going. They kept elective surgery going, did a really amazing job. Today, only 6% of the current hospitalizations in the state are related to the China virus. Arizona’s also demonstrated success in protecting the state’s African American population. Only 5% of patients hospitalized were African American, and African Americans represent just 2% of all deaths from the virus. As it has worked to contain its outbreak, Arizona has also been formulating a plan to get children safely back to school as soon as possible. We want our schools open all over the country. We want our schools open. Arizona has worked very hard on this and they’re doing very well. The Department of Education is providing Arizona schools with $625 million. They’re working very hard, and that’s in conjunction with CARES funding. My administration is actively working with other States in the same way we worked with Arizona. In recent weeks, members of the coronavirus taskforce have visited over 15 states to encourage them to follow our path forward, including Tennessee, Kentucky, Virginia, Indiana, and Ohio. And I’ll be going to Ohio tomorrow. I look forward to it very much. It’s a great place and a great state with an excellent governor. And we look forward to being there tomorrow. Next week, Dr. Birx will be visiting Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Arkansas. And also, I believe they’re trying to get in West Virginia. A great place, a great state. And I’m sure that will happen because we’d like it to happen. They’d like to see her. So we’re going to try very hard to get the doctor to West Virginia in addition to those states to deliver aggressive, tailored and targeted guidance. The strategy we’re taking to these states will protect those at highest risk, while allowing others at a lower risk to safely resume work and school. If we do this successfully, it can be really something incredible because we’re talking about a lot of states. We’re talking about many, many states. It’s really great to see also that Florida, we’re coming down, it’s coming down, and pretty substantially in many locations. And even Miami is starting to come down. Miami was hit very hard. California, likewise, and Texas, likewise, coming down and really starting to be a substantial amount of reduction. It recognizes that prolonged lockdowns imposed a wide range of serious public health threats, including higher levels of suicide, drug overdoses, and other significant health harms resulting from the depression that we talked about. Social isolation, economic hardship, it’s been very tough for those people that are put in a lockdown position for too long. It really has been a very tough and harmful situation for many people. The fact is that these harms are not measured daily here or abroad. It makes them, really, a very serious threat because people don’t know exactly what they are and how bad they are. But I think they’re very bad. Going forward, we must continue to remain vigilant in shielding of the elderly and those with underlying conditions. Approximately half of all deaths have occurred in nursing homes and longterm care facilities, which is an incredible number and statistic if you think about it. I also urge Americans to help us stop the spread of the virus. Practice good hygiene, socially distance, avoid large crowds, and wear a mask where distancing is not possible. It’s a patriotic thing to do. If you are sick, isolate yourself, especially from high risk family members and friends. So important, isolate yourself from high risk family members and friends if you’re not feeling well. Together, we will defeat the virus and emerge from this safer and stronger than ever. Thanks to the robust federal action in partnership with state and local leaders, new cases of the virus are declining in 80% of the jurisdictions, which is an incredible number. And the overall test positivity rate has declined by 8% since last week. Zero states have seen outbreaks get worse since yesterday. So zero states. We’re also continuing to make progress in the development of a vaccine. This is something so important. Also, therapeutics are on the front burner. We’re having tremendous… I think. We’ll let you know very soon. I think long before the end of the year. We’re having tremendous success on therapeutics and tremendous success on vaccines, and we’re ready to deliver them literally as soon as they are okayed. This morning, my administration approved $1 billion for Johnson & Johnson, who’s been working very hard in the [inaudible 00:13:52] have something very special, to manufacture and distribute 100 million doses of a China virus vaccine as soon as one is available. And again, we think that’s going to be soon and we think we’re going to have the vaccines before the end of the year, maybe long before the end of the year. Finally, today, I’m pleased to announce that the Department of Justice has issued $35 million in grants to 73 organizations nationwide, providing assistance to human trafficking victims. A terrible thing. You think of human trafficking as being an ancient form of crime. It’s not because of the internet. It’s a very modern crime all over the world. Not just here, all over the world, human trafficking. It’s usually in women or women and children. But it’s, again, because of the internet. It’s a terrible situation. Never been like this. And also, survivors who have faced heightened dangers during the pandemic, it’s actually increased during the pandemic. I guess some reasons are obvious and some reasons are less obvious, but human trafficking, we’re working very, very strongly. The wall is up to 277 miles right now. And it’s going up. By the end of the year, it’ll be largely finished shortly after the end of the year. And it’s had a tremendous impact, a very positive impact on human trafficking. Unbelievable impact actually. My administration will never rest in our fight against the human trafficking [inaudible 00:07:23]. It’s one of the most horrific of crimes, and we worked very hard on that. With that, we'll take some questions. Please? Well, if you read, even The Washington Post had a terrible story on a mail-in, and The New York Times, and many newspapers have had terrible stories. You see them all over the internet. They’ve had some just horrible stories on mail- in ballots. You look at Arizona, you don’t even have to have … as you know, they have a provision where they don’t have to check signatures. You sign it, and you could have a totally different signature. It’s okay. It won’t be approved. They have the right to go seven days after the election for approval, so you’re not even going to know who won the state of Nevada. Okay, but that’s not what they said when they approved it. They said they’re not going to check signatures. They’re not going to be able to. And their machinery, which is old, doesn’t allow them to. It’s going to be physically impossible for them to do that, especially in a short period of time. In addition, you have the November 3rd election, and they’re allowed to count votes until seven days after the election. What does that mean? If Nevada, which is a big state and a great state … a state I like very much, and I think we’re going to do very well there. Are we going to wait a week after November 3rd if it comes down to Nevada, which it could very well? I don’t think so. I don’t think it’s appropriate. With all of the bundling that you’re going to have, with the harvesting you’re going to have, with people being sent ballots all over that have maybe nothing to do with the state anymore, it’s a terrible thing. In New York, they had the Carolyn Maloney situation, and I criticized it badly over the last two years and two days. I mean, I gave it some very, very strong criticism. And all of a sudden like a miracle, they just approved the winner. Well, what happened? Did the person that was second concede the race, even though it was very close and all mixed up? They have a terrible situation in New York with the ballots. You know that. And as soon as I said, “Well, I think you should have a new election,” because the election … obviously, they’re not going to know what to do. “I think you should have a new election.” They all of a sudden announced a winner. I assume it was her, but they announced a winner. Well, I don’t agree with it. Did somebody speak to the person on the other side, the opponent? Did they do something for the opponent on the other side? Take a look at Patterson, New Jersey. Take a look at many things. It’s all over newspapers what’s going on with the mail-in ballots. They send out millions of ballots. Millions of ballots. They’re totally unprepared to do it, and then they come back in the millions. It’s going to be a disaster. I’m doing our country a big favor by bringing it up. And from a common stance or even common sense standpoint, if you look at it just out of common sense and pure, basic, beautiful intelligence, you know it can’t work. Now, Florida’s worked very hard for years and years in developing a system, and I’m sure they probably have problems also. But absentee ballots are different than mail-in ballots. What you call universal mail-in ballots. So much different. You have to apply for it. You have to do different things, and it’s a much better system, and it’s a system that can be reasonably accurate. But there’s no system like going to the poll and voting. I would like to find out why all of a sudden out of nowhere in the midst of all of this grief, why is it that they approve the New York race … Why you asked that question? Oh, really? Well, then you’re reading a different newspaper than me. Go ahead, please. [crosstalk 00:19:32] Go ahead, please. It's going away. It’s going away now. It’ll go away. Things go away. Absolutely. No question in my mind. It will go away. Please. Go ahead. [crosstalk 00:19:53] Hopefully sooner rather than later. Well, I’d like to see the schools open. I think many of the schools … most of the schools will be open. I can say that Republican areas want to see them open, and the Democrats probably want to keep them closed until after November 3rd, because they think it’s good for them politically. I actually don’t think it’s good for them politically. Parents want the schools open. We want them open. We want them open safely. We’re going to practice very strong hygiene, and all of the other things that I’ve enumerated many times. But we want to see the schools open. No, not his model. I just think he’s done a very good job. I mean, he’s really done a great job. You look at the numbers, you look at how it’s dropped, and very rapidly he’s done a great job. He’s a great governor. Please. I’m talking about from getting very sick. If you look at children, I mean, they’re able to throw it off very easily. It’s an amazing thing. Because some flus, they don’t. They get very sick, and they have problems with flus and they have problems with other things. But for whatever reason, the China virus, children handle it very well. And they may get it, but they get it and it doesn’t have much of an impact on them. If you look at the numbers, the numbers in terms of mortality fatality, the numbers for children under a certain age … meaning young, their immune systems are very, very strong. They’re very powerful. They seem to be able to handle it very well, and that’s according to every statistic. Whose ballot? With Kanye? Kanye West? I don't know that. Who said that? I don't know. I like him. I mean, I like him. He's always been very nice to me. He's talking about Kanye West. No. Not at all. No, not at all. Other than I get along with him very well … I like him. I like his wife. His wife recommended certain people as you know, including Alice Johnson as a fantastic woman. But his wife recommended certain people to get out of prison. They were in prison for a long time. A long, long time. It should have never happened. I took what she said very strong … Kim. Kim Kardashian. She’s got a good heart. Very good heart. I like Kanye very much. No, I have nothing to do with him getting on the ballot. We’ll have to see what happens. We’ll see he gets on there, but I’m not involved. What Republican senators are doing-Well, if they need it. Certainly, that’s a business … Some businesses are doing better than they would normally. Obviously, we know what those businesses are. Obviously, the airline business is not doing very well. You have shutdowns all over the world, and you have airlines that are essentially shut down. Some airlines are doing modest … best they’re doing is modest. I think it’s very important that we keep the airlines going. They’ll be very good times very soon, I hope. We don’t want to lose our airlines. If they’re looking at that, whether they’re Republican or Democrat, I’d be certainly in favor. We can’t lose our transportation system. Yes. Go ahead. They don’t really know what it was. I can tell you, whatever happened, it’s terrible, but they don’t really know what it is. Nobody knows yet. At this moment, they’re looking. It could have… I mean, how can you say accident? Somebody left some terrible explosive-type devices and things around, perhaps? Perhaps it was that. Perhaps it was an attack. I don’t think anybody can say right now. We’re looking into it very strongly. Right now, you have some people think it was an attack, and you have some people that think it wasn’t. In any event, it was a terrible event. A lot of people were killed and a tremendous number of people were badly wounded, injured. We’re standing with that country. We have a very good relationship with that country, but it’s a country under a lot of turmoil, a lot of problems, but we stand with them. John Thune did Right? The Republican John Thune? Oh. Okay. Well, it is legal. There is no Hatch Act because it doesn’t pertain to the president. If I use the White House, we save tremendous amounts of money for the government in terms of security, traveling. If we go to another state or some other location, the amount of money is very enormous. That’s something to consider also. I think it would be a very convenient location that would be by far the least expensive location. There would be very little in terms of that tremendous traveling, security with airplanes and everybody flying all over the place. I think it would be a very convenient idea, it’s something that we threw out. It would be very cost conscious by comparison to any other location. Yeah, please. Reject it in what way? Well, I’d listen to both sides. I don’t know of the argument yet, but I would certainly listen to both sides. My son has some very strong opinions. He is very much of an environmentalist and he was very impressed with what we did yesterday because that’s one of the great environmental bills, and beyond that, ever signed since, well, I guess over a hundred years. If you think about it, it’s been a long time. I will look at both sides of it. I had heard about it. I understand they’re going to be doing a briefing sometime over the next 48 hours. It’s going to go very quickly. I’ve done a lot for Alaska. I love Alaska. It’s a special place. ANWR was one thing. The highway, curved highway or whatever the new name is, whatever the old name is. We’re getting approvals for a tremendous highway that’s been sought for. 40 years, they’ve been trying to get it approved, and I’m getting it approved. We’ve done a lot for Alaska. It’s a special place. I’ll take a look at that. It’s interesting. Yeah, please. Go ahead. Not 300 billion, no. Not 300...You mean 300 million? I just heard of it for the first time. The ambulance people have done an incredible job, as have the doctors, the nurses, the frontline workers. Law enforcement has been incredible. The military, FEMA, I could name almost every group. I can’t tell you of a group that’s done poorly, but the ambulance people have done a… It’s a tough job too. Very dangerous job, very tough job. I will certainly look in. You’re telling me something, that, for the first time. Nobody is complaining about not getting paid too much, but we’ll take a look at the ambulance drivers. If that’s what he heard… I’ve heard it both ways too. I’ve heard accident, I’ve heard explosives. Obviously, it must’ve been some form of explosives. Whether it was a bomb intentionally set off… it ended up being a bomb. No, I’ve heard it both ways. It could have been an accident, and it could have also been something that was very offensive. I wouldn’t be very happy with that. We’re working very closely with the government, and we’re working very closely with many different agencies including the military, and we’ll be able to figure it out. We already, probably, have figured it out. Thank you very much everybody. Thank you.
















"
"28","08-06-20","… number that you can have, and that’s all we’re allowed. So you’re a very special group, and thank you all for coming out here. Thank you, thank you. So I’m thrilled to be back in Ohio, and proud of the hardworking patriots of the Buckeye State. Four years ago, I came here, right in here. That was an amazing four years ago, wasn’t it, when you think how time flies? Right here in Cleveland, to accept the Republican nomination for President of the United States. And we’ve worked hard and we’ve done some job, and they’re finally starting to recognize it, they’ll see. You know when they’re going to recognize it? On November 3rd, that’s when they’re going to recognize it. Three months from now on November 3rd, we will once again win the State of Ohio like we did last time. I just spoke to Bob Paduchik and he says we’re doing better than we did last time, and I think we won it by almost nine points. He said we’re doing better than last time. Thank you, Bob. We’re looking forward to really … I mean, look. We’re running against radical left ideology. Their messenger is Sleepy Joe. He doesn’t know it’s his message, he has no idea what the message is. But he’s going to do whatever they tell him to do, you know it, because he’s not all there. I want to just say that a very good friend of mine just tested positive, do you know that? Our great governor. Governor of Ohio, DeWine, just tested positive just here. And we want to wish him the best. He’ll be fine. I guess he’s going for a secondary test. I just said, “I look forward to seeing the governor.” They said, ” Sir, he just tested positive.” But he’s a great guy, he’s done a fantastic job. And your lieutenant governor, Jon Husted, is here some place. John, hi, John. Thank you, John, very much. Also, House speaker, Bob Cupp. Thank you, Bob. Thanks, Bob. Republican candidate for Ohio’s 13th district, Christina Hagan. Christina, come here. Come up here, John, just come up here. Bob, come up here. Come on up here. Because I don’t know if they hear me with these crazy speakers, but whatever. Just social-distance, Christina. Right there, Christina. So listen, you have a guy, really, he is so terrible, Tim Ryan. This woman is incredible. You got to let her win. Tim Ryan, he talks and he talks and he talks, gets nothing done. I mean, we have to beat this. He only talks about jobs. He does nothing. We have in Christina, an incredible candidate, incredible in every way. She will work so hard for you. Tim Ryan goes out, he runs for President. He got zero, zero, zero, zero. All talk. So I hope, Christina, they’re going to put you there. You have my complete and total endorsement, and that’s meant a lot. That’s meant a lot. I think it’s about 244 to two or three or something. I don’t want you to be number four, okay? You’re going to get it. I promise you’re doing a great job. We appreciate it. Say hello to the governor too, but we’ll finish this up. Thank you very much. Christina, thank you very much. Good luck. We’re with you all they way, Christina. We got to win. Also we have our Republican party chairwoman, Lisa Stickan. Lisa, hi, Lisa. Thank you, Lisa. Great job you’re doing, thank you. Are we doing good, Lisa? Good. And we have, as you know, Gene Scalia. Good blood line, Gene Scalia. There he is. And Bob Paduchik, who was with me from day one in Ohio, and he has done a fantastic job. So I’ve come to visit the workers of a great state and a great American company, Whirlpool. They had a lot of problems until I got involved, and now they’re doing great. It’s the largest washing machine manufacturing facility in the world. It’s in Clyde, Ohio. You know that, that’s where I’m going. Under the last administration, the men and women of Whirlpool saw their job and factories targeted for destruction and yet … You know the story, right? Vice President Biden, he’s a real beauty. He let it happen. Foreign made washing machines were dumped in our market below cost, in order to put Whirlpool out of business. And yet the Obama administration, with Joe Biden watching over, freely allowed this grave injustice to continue. They let other countries pillage American jobs, lay waste to American communities and eviscerate American middle class. So they allowed things to happen, which should never have happened to you, and we brought it back. And you know that. We have brought it back. Under my administration, all of that has changed. We stood up to the foreign cheaters. We defended American jobs. We imposed massive tariffs on foreign washing machines and we saved the workers of Whirlpool. In every thing we do, we are finally putting America first. That’s right. During Joe Biden’s five decades in Washington … Think of it. He’s been in public office for 47 years. He’s done nothing, now he’s going to fix everything. It doesn’t work that way. And I wouldn’t say he’s at the top of his game, would you? You think? But he supported every single globalist attack on American workers. Joe Biden’s policies put China first and America last, and that’s what he’ll continue to do, if he ever got this shot. And you will have a disruption in the market, the likes of which our country has never seen. You will have a crash in the markets, because he’s going double and triple your taxes. He’s going to do things that nobody ever would ever think even possible. Because he’s following the radical left agenda. Take away your guns. Destroy your second amendment. No religion, no anything. Hurt the Bible, hurt God. He’s against God. He’s against guns. He’s against energy, our kind of energy. I don’t think he’s going to do to well in Ohio. If he did, we’d have a big story. He’s not going to do well. I was in Texas the other day. I said, “Wait a minute. The other side is against guns. They’re against oil and gas. They’re against religion, Bible, God. How’s he going to win Texas? How’s he going to win Texas?” He’s not going to win Texas. He’s not going to win Ohio. Bob told me we’re better now in Ohio than we were four years ago. I’ll take the same victory, but I think we’re better. So I just want to tell you that my first week in office, I canceled the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which was a disaster. I canceled the so called Clean Power Plan, which only had a nice name. It took all of your land away. I’ve been given more credit for that maybe than anything. It gave you back your rights. It gave you back your freedom. I canceled the so called Clean Power Plan, withdrew the United States from unfair Paris climate accord, which was costing us a fortune, which was meant against us, which was pitted against us. And ended the war on American energy. We’re now number one in the world in energy, energy production. We renegotiated the Korean trade deal, which was a disaster. I imported and came in with what we took into our country and then put out. But most importantly, I opposed historic tariffs on China, and stood up to China’s rampant trading abuses. They had the worst year in 67 years. We had the best year we’ve ever had. And now we’re going back to that again. And then of course, I passed the largest tax cuts in the history of our country and the largest regulation cuts in the history of our country. We got rid of all of those job killing regulations. And that’s one of the reasons that not only did we do well, but we’re doing well. And you’ll see numbers coming out, they’re coming out very well. Including, look at the stock market. We’re almost at an all time high. And NASDAQ, a month ago, just hit the highest it’s ever been. So to me, that means jobs. One of the things I did in Lima … Do you know Lima? We saved your tank plant. And I came in and it was gone, and I said, “Give me a tour of the tank plant.” And we went to Lima. I looked at it, I said, “Supposed we need tanks?” “Well, I guess we have to buy them overseas.” That’s no good. And I said, “I canceled the order to…” I saved it. And now is doing business like it’s never done before and I’m very proud. That was a very personal thing for me. I’m pretty good at this stuff. When I went through that plant, I said, “You can’t rebuild this. And more importantly, you’ll never get people that can build. They’re very, very complicated and complex.” And I said, “You’ll never get people to do this job again.” So I just want to thank you, you’ve been with me, all of you, from the beginning. I want to thank you. We’re taking a helicopter ride. You know where we’re going, over to Whirlpool. But I wanted to thank you. I wanted to say you’re a very special group of people. We’re going to win bigger in Ohio now than we did four years ago. And we’re very proud of what we’ve done. We built the greatest economy in the history of the world, better than any other nation by far. And then the plague was released by China. Whether it was incompetent or other reasons, it got out. It didn’t get out to China, but it got out to the US, and to Europe and a lot of other countries, 188 countries. And we will not forget that. We will not be forgetting that. But now, we’re rebuilding. We closed it. We saved millions of lives, and now we’re reopening. We want our schools open. We want our buildings open, our office buildings open. We want to get back to business and we’re doing it. And it’s looking more and more like just as I predicted, it’s going to be V. Did you see yesterday? Auto production, one of the highest numbers they’ve ever seen. Used car sales, one of the highest numbers, I think the highest number they’ve ever seen. Those are big numbers. So we’re doing really well. We’re going to have a tremendous third quarter, but we’re going to have a fantastic next year. Ohio, I love you and I love all of these incredible workers. Thank you. Right from the beginning, thank you…
















"
"29","08-07-20","Thank you very much, and it’s a great honor to have everybody here. I know the press was not quite expecting this, so I appreciate your being able to attend. We have a terrific number of things and some very positive things to tell you tonight. I want to begin by giving an update on the economy. Economic health is vital to public health, that’s why our strategy to kill the China virus is focused on protecting those at greatest risk, while allowing younger and healthy Americans to safely return to work and safely return to school. Very important. We added 1.8 million new jobs in July, exceeding predictions for the third month in a row, and adding a total of over 9.3 million jobs since May. And I will say that the job growth that we’ve seen over the last three months, 9.3 million, is the single greatest three-month period of job creation in American history. That’s big stuff. That’s big news and great news. Over the past three months, the United States has surpassed market expectations by a total of 12 million new jobs. Over the last three months, the United States has added 623,000 manufacturing jobs. Remember you’d need a magic wand to get manufacturing jobs. And we’re getting them even in a pandemic, which is disappearing. It’s going to disappear. And 639,000 brand new construction jobs. Over half of the new jobs are full time jobs, and wages are up by 4.8%, which is terrific. Unemployment has fallen by nearly 30% since April. Think of that. 30% since April. Hispanic American unemployment has decreased by nearly 32%. Jobs held by African Americans, which were hit especially hard by the shutdowns, incredibly hard, increased by nearly one million over the past three months, and that’s also a record. That’s a job record. African American, one million, it’s a job record. We must ensure that the progress continues. My administration has enacted over three trillion in historic relief since China allowed the virus to infect the world. So we’ve contributed $3 trillion. My administration continues to work in good faith to reach an agreement with democrats in Congress that will extend unemployment benefits, provide protections against evictions. A terrible thing happens with evictions. Not fair. It wasn’t their fault that we were infected with this disease from China, and get relief to American families. Yet tragically, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer continue to insist on radical left wing policies that have nothing to do with the China virus, nothing to do with it at all. So you have a virus that comes in and you have people in Congress that don’t want to help our people. If Democrats continue to hold this critical relief hostage, I will act under my authority as president to get Americans the relief they need. And what we’re talking about is deferring the payroll tax for a period of months ’til the end of the year, and I can extend it at a certain period. Hopefully I will be here to do the job. We’re going to do the job. We’ve been doing a job like nobody could, nobody would, actually. And so we’re going to have the payroll tax go ’til the end of the year, and it’ll be retroactive to July 1st. So we’re going to go back to July 1st and it’ll go to the end of the year, payroll tax. At the end of the year, it may be extended. We’re going to enhance unemployment benefits through the end of the year. So unemployment benefits will be… That’s a big one. Will be brought out to the end of the year, and defer student loan payments and forgive interest until further notice. So students who were paying student loans and in many cases, they’re not even allowed to go back into their colleges. Extend the eviction moratorium. We will be extending that, so people aren’t evicted. Not their fault. We had a lengthy discussion this morning with President Macron of France concerning numerous subjects, but in particular, the catastrophic event which took place in Beirut, Lebanon. Horrible, horrible event. At 3:00 PM this afternoon, I spoke with President Aoun of Lebanon to inform him that three large aircraft are on the way, and they’re fully loaded with medical supplies, food, water, and many other things. Lots of emergency equipment. Also, first responders, technicians, doctors and nurses are on their way. This was an event like the world has not seen for a long time. Horrible event. We’ll be having a conference call on Sunday with President Macron, leaders of Lebanon, and leaders from various parts of the world. Everyone wants to help. We spoke to a lot of people. They all want to help. The United States is with authorities on the ground right now in Lebanon to identify further health and humanitarian needs, and we will provide further assistance in the period to come. We’re working very closely with their government and with their leaders. And on behalf of the United States, I want to extend our condolences to all of the families. A much larger number of families than anybody would have thought, and that anybody at first thought. But all of those families who lost loved ones, relatives, friends in this horrible tragedy, we stand firmly with the people of Lebanon, and we’ll continue to offer our full support through this very difficult time. We have not seen anything like this in a long time. As you know, earlier this week, I met with American workers at the Tennessee Valley Authority, who had been laid off by the leadership at the Tennessee Valley Authority. As you know, this is a form of utility. It’s been around for a long time since FTR. And the head person not controlled by government, but it’s sort of, semi-public in a sense, gets paid the highest salary in the world of government. He gets $8 million a year. That’s not a bad amount of money. It’s $8 million a year. And we are not accepting that. Even though we’re not the ones that appoint him or her, but in this case him. We’re not accepting somebody getting paid $8 million a year. This has been going on for many years, and we will do something about that, and we’re already in negotiations right now, including possible termination. They and hundreds of their fellow American tech workers, the workers at the TVA were being terminated from their positions on top of all of this, and on top of the $8 million salary and a chief of staff who makes much more than a million dollars a year. But on top of all that, they were being terminated from their positions, these incredible people, in order to train the lower cost foreign workers imported to replace them. How’s that for a law? When this was set up originally to create jobs and economic development, and now they’re getting fired and they’re supposed to train people who get a much lower salary. It’s crazy. This was a grave injustice. I fired the chairman of the board and response. On Friday, I fired the chairman of the board along with one other board member. That’s the one thing we have. We have the right to fire board members. And I made it clear that if they did not swiftly reverse course, I would continue with these firings of the board members. And we just were informed that they have agreed to change course totally. And today, I’m proud to announce that a major victory for the workers of Tennessee, and Kentucky, and other areas that are covered, great states, great states. That the leadership of the TVA has canceled all of the layoffs and given hundreds of American workers their jobs back. They’re being rehired as we speak. In this administration, we live by two rules, buy American and hire American. You can’t do that. You can’t fire all our workers and hire people back from other far away parts of the world at lower prices, especially when they have to train the people. And they can never train them as good as what you have because they’ve been there for many years, they’ve done a fantastic job and they love the TVA. We had a lot of people in the office the other day. A lot of the media was covering it. They love the Tennessee Valley Authority. And they’re so proud to work for it, but this happened and it was a terrible thing. So now they’re going to get their jobs back. They’re all going to be getting their jobs back. Nearly every nation on earth continues to combat the virus. A number of countries are seeing a surge in new cases, including Japan, the Philippines, major parts of Europe. Cases continue to surge. In Latin America, it’s right now the most infected place anywhere in the world. They have more than doubled in recent days, Latin America is doing very little testing. They’re not really equipped to do that. It’s tough. In the United States, more than 80% of jurisdictions report declining cases, we’re doing very well. You don’t hear that too often from the media, but we’re doing very well. We have a very large country, very complex country in a sense. More than half of America’s counties report fewer than 20 cases last week. So if you look at that, more than half of America’s counties report fewer than 20 cases last week, but we have to remain vigilant. We’re doing very well, but we have to remain vigilant. Nationally, the percentage of emergency room visits with the coronavirus symptoms is down to almost half what it was in July. The Southern states that were very strong hotspots not long ago, Arizona, Texas, Florida, continue to show significant improvement, including increased availability of hospital beds. Arizona now has the smallest number of coronavirus inpatients since mid June. It’s gone. The governor was up, and we had a great meeting. Governor Ducey, and the meeting was a terrific. But since mid June so they’re doing well. And it’s going down, heading down very rapidly actually. Texas is stabilizing and improving rapidly with some progress in the Rio Grande Valley and other communities along the border with Mexico that had shown the biggest increases in hospitalizations and deaths. Florida is also stabilizing its statewide positive test rate continues to decrease from 13% on July 23rd to 8% this week. Florida has done very well. It’s going down, it’s heading down actually quite rapidly and even Miami which was the hottest spot in Florida is heading downward. But Florida has done very well. Texas has done very well and rapidly and Arizona has done incredibly well. So Arizona has really been a very rapid drop. New Jersey and New York remain stable with less than 1% of emergency room visits due to the China virus. The illness took a devastating toll on both states as you know. Well, both States really took the brunt of the infection earlier this year. Thankfully we have not seen a resurgence. They’ve been doing a good job. Everybody’s working very hard. Both governors are working very, very hard we’re in touch with them, we’re supplying them with a lot of supplies as needed if needed, but they’re needing very little right now. They’re in very good shape. We will continue to monitor the new cases. Throughout this crisis my administration has provided extraordinary support of people, equipment, medical supplies, to the people of New Jersey, the people of New York and to the people of every state, all of our states. We’re carefully monitoring California Central Valley, as well as San Diego, Los Angeles, Sacramento and San Francisco, which are starting to stabilize and go down. We’re carefully watching regions from increasing cases including Boston and Chicago, as well as the Midwest. We’re watching them all very carefully. It’s vital that all Americans work together to protect the vulnerable. For this reason, we’ve delivered vast amounts of protective equipment and testing supplies to nursing homes all across America. We’re focused very much on the elderly, especially the elderly where they have heart problems or diabetes problems. Diabetes is a big problem. Approximately half of all deaths have occurred in nursing homes and longterm care facility. That’s an incredible number when you hear half of the deaths have been in nursing homes and longterm care facilities. And I will tell you that I met with owners and representatives of nursing homes and they are very, very vigilant. They’re doing a very good job now. They’ve really done something that I think is special. They’re doing very well in terms of the virus. They’re working very hard and a lot of things happened. A lot of forces came together and hit the nursing homes very hard, but the representatives of nursing homes, in some cases the ownership of nursing homes they’re working very hard. The federal government and the private sector have delivered more than 9,000,000 N95 masks, 27 million surgical masks, 3 million face shields, 20 million gowns and 668 million gloves to New Jersey alone. Think of that. We provided $3.4 billion to the state of New Jersey in emergency relief funding. So we happen to be in New Jersey right now so those are great numbers. The governor’s working very hard. Governor Murphy’s doing a good job. We’re working very closely with him. We’ve also provided nearly $5 billion to New Jersey hospitals and healthcare facilities. And through the paycheck protection program that you all know so well, we provided $23 billion to support more than 250,000 New Jersey small businesses. A lot of the small businesses that you see that are opening now and going to do well they’re there because of what we did with paycheck protection. On therapeutics and vaccine updates, three vaccine candidates have now moved into phase three trials. This would be years ahead of schedule. We have done wonders with the FDA, want to thank the FDA and all of the great people there and Dr. Hahn. But we have phase three trials already going on, which is most people would have said impossible to even think about. Today Pfizer announced that it will manufacture Gilead’s remdesivir where we’ve had tremendous success. Last week alone my administration procured and distributed over 120,000 vials of remdesivir enough to treat more than 19,000 patients. Plasma treatments continue to show incredibly encouraging results, really incredible what’s going on. And if you can go to a blood bank, if you’ve had this disease and beat it, and there are a lot of people that have. If you could go to a blood bank and donate, that would be a tremendous help. The United States is only 5% of the world’s population, but we have conducted over 25% of the world’s testing. Think of that, 5% and we’ve given 25% of the world’s testing. Any proper global analysis of confirmed cases must really take this into account. We’re constantly showing cases, cases, cases, cases are up. Well, the reason cases are up because we’re doing, one of the reasons, we’re doing a lot of testing. We’re doing much more testing than anyone else. Close to 65 million tests where other countries have done very little testing. They’ll test people if they get sick, they’ll test people if they go into the hospital, they’ll test certain people. We’re doing tremendous testing and we’re especially doing big testing at the nursing homes. Over the last week the testing turnaround times have declined significantly as our major commercial labs have begun pulling samples. And we’ve also been able to send out many more of the tests which are the five minute to 15 minute result tests. Testing samples from multiple patients in one batch is also something that we’re very focused on and doing, but in the not too distant future we’ll have so many tests where it’s a quick test. They call it a quick test, five minutes to 15 minutes. So we won’t even have to worry too much about the process of sending and receiving. Because if you figure it takes a day to send and a day to receive and let’s say a day at the laboratory, that’s three days right there. Then the other tests you can have them in five to 15 minutes. Over the next two weeks I’ll be pursuing a major executive order requiring health insurance companies to cover all preexisting conditions for all customers. That’s a big thing. I’ve always been very strongly in favor. We have to cover preexisting conditions. So we will be pursuing a major executive order requiring health insurance companies to cover all preexisting conditions for all of its customers. This has never been done before, but it’s time the people of our country are properly represented and properly taken care of. This follows a series of executive orders to lower drug prices and lower prescription drug prices. And significantly we had the only year which was last year where drug prices went down in 51 years. But we’re talking about going down at a level that nobody has even thought possible now. Even though the drug companies are running very big ads on me, but that’s usually a reason. They’re not too happy. They can’t be too thrilled, but they’ve made a lot of money over the years. And the prices just go up, not fair. This includes a landmark executive order requiring drug companies to change Americans and charge Americans no more than they charged to foreign countries. So they have to charge Americans no more than they charge to foreign countries. That means our country can’t be charged more. So if Germany gets drugs at a very small or low price and we’re paying many times that price in the United States because we pay for all of the research, development, the promotion and other things we will get what’s called a favored-nations clause. We’re going to have and I signed a favored-nations clause. So that the United States, which is the number one purchaser of drugs by far in the world, biggest purchaser in the world, not even close. You have other countries that are bigger. If you look at India, China, et cetera, not too many. But we have countries that are bigger but not even close in terms of ordering drugs, we’re the number one country in the world, but we have a favored-nation. So if somebody has a drug, many cases it comes from a plant. It’s the same pill, it’s the same medicine or medication, whatever the lowest country charges. So if Germany charges 25 cents for a pill and we charge $2 and I only use Germany as an example, then we get that or 25 cents. So what’s going to happen is that’s going to go up a little bit and ours is going to come down a whole lot. So it’s a favored nations. And I will tell you that Big Pharma is not happy. For too long we’ve been forced to subsidize cheaper drug prices in foreign countries. We’ve subsidized them to a level that nobody can believe. Nobody talked about it. Everybody wondered how come every president that runs for office says they’re going to lower drug prices and they never do, they go through the roof. Over the last administration they went up like skyrocketing, skyrocketing, that’s Biden. Biden’s not going to be able to do it. He has no clue. So what’s happening is we are going to be working to get rid of all the subsidy to foreign lands. And we’re going to give essentially all of the benefit that frankly they have as great negotiators those benefits are going to go to our people. So it’s called a favored-nations clause and you can look it up and you can see and nobody’s had the courage to institute it to call it because it’s a very big step. But it’s something that is going to drive drug prices down 50, 60, maybe even 70%. Talking about numbers that are unbelievable. I also signed an executive order stopping middlemen from taking advantage of Medicare patients by charging higher prices to them and pocketing the discounts for themselves. These are some of the richest people in the world. Everyone talked about middlemen. I’ve heard about them for years on prescription drug prices. Middlemen, I guess you’d have to say to be politically correct middlemen and women. But you never heard that the middle woman before you heard middlemen that’s the term. And say what you want about the drug companies, but at least the drug companies produce a product. They produce the pill, they produce the medicine, the medication. But these people make billions and billions of dollars. I don’t know who they are, but they’re very rich, but they won’t be so rich anymore. This executive order requires these $30 billion in discounts to go straight to the American patients. So the middleman is going to be knocked out, and I’m going to lose a lot of friends even though I have no idea who these people are. On opioids, I’m pleased to announce that my administration invested an additional $100 million to fight the opioid crisis in rural America. In the midst of the China virus pandemic, we also keep fighting to end the opioid epidemic, and we’ve done very well. It was prior to the virus, we were down 18%, 19%, and 20%. But when you think about it, that means that you have 80% and that’s not acceptable. The wall is going up. We have 276 miles of wall. It’s having a tremendous impact on drugs coming into our country already. It’ll be finished toward the end of the year, and its had a very, very big impact. On Portland, finally, I’d like to address that situation. Portland is a disaster. It’s been a disaster for many, many years. Brave federal law enforcement officers single-handedly… The officers, they single-handedly saved the federal courthouse in Portland from lawless rioters and agitators and anarchists, and that’s what they are. When you find Molotov cocktails in somebody’s knapsack and they say, “No, I’m just here to have a good time.” These are really sick, disturbed people. The disgraced of mayor of the city has ordered the police to stand down in the face of rioters, leaving his citizens at the mercy of this mob. He was at the mercy of the mob too. If you saw him go out there the other day, it was terrible. He went out there and they wanted to rip them apart. But fortunately he had five people with him, called security. Mayor Wheeler has abdicated his duty and surrendered his city to the mob. As a result, the mob descended upon a police precinct and tried to burn it down, tear it down, rip it down, and the act of attempted murder. Left wing violence extremism imposes an increasing threat to our country, and we stop it. You have no idea how much we stop, but It’s an ideology we have to stop. When you commit arson, this is a quote from the mayor, he’s come a long way. He just made this quote, “When you commit arson with an accelerant in the attempt to burn down a building that is occupied by people who have intentionally been trapped inside, you’re not a demonstrator or you’re not demonstrating” said Mayor Wheeler, “You are attempting to commit murder.” That’s come a long way, he’s come a long way when he made that statement. What you’re seeing in Portland is the radical left’s agenda in action. Portland is their roadmap for America. If the radical left gets in, and they treat Joe Biden as a puppet, he’s merely a puppet. But if the radical left gets in, they look at Portland as a thing that they want, that’s what they want. Why? Who knows, does it matter? It’s a different thinking, but it’s a mess. And I want to thank Homeland Security. They’ve done a fantastic job. We had our people go in. They stopped any intrusion into the courthouse and the courthouse was saved, and other federal buildings were saved. And we would like to be asked by the mayor or the governor, we will go in and stop the problems in Portland in 24 hours just like we did in Minneapolis after they really hurt that city. But the National Guard went and did a phenomenal job. It was over in three hours. After watching six days of horror, it ended in three hours. You all saw the scene of them walking right down the street. It was actually an unfortunate view, but an incredible view of how to do things. So we would be able to solve the Portland situation immediately. But we are supposed to be asked. If we are not asked, and if it continues, we’ll have to make a decision. But it’s a very easy thing for us to do. We could stop it very quickly. It’s been going on now for 76 days, but our buildings are very secure. If the Democrats controlled in Washington, the Democrats control of Washington, they’d pass with all of the things they do. Legislation gutting every single police department in America. They truly do, many of these people wanted to defund the police department. At a minimum, they’re going to stop money from going to the police department. But in many cases, they actually want to defund completely the police department. No city, no town, and no suburb would be safe. Your suburbs would be a disaster. Your cities, your towns would be a disaster. They want every city to be a Portland or to be a Chicago, which is totally out of control, and we’re waiting for the mayor. We’ve sent people in to help them from an intelligence standpoint, but we’re waiting for them to call, the governor, the mayor. We could do a very good job in Chicago. Nobody’s ever seen anything like that, this country. And yet nationwide, numbers are good despite the Chicago’s and Portland’s and frankly, the New York’s when you look at what’s happened in New York. 348% increase in the last number of months, nobody’s seen anything like that, so sad. To me it’s so sad because I love New York. And it’s so sad, and all it is, is horrible, horrible, incompetent management by politicians that truly don’t know what they’re doing. So just like we saved the courthouse, we will save the United States of America. And a vast majority of people agree with me, a vast majority, most people. They don’t speak up as much as they could, but we know they’re there and everybody else knows they’re there too. So with that, I’ll take a few questions from the media. They’ve been here for a long time and they’ve been waiting outside for a long time, and they wait for these moments. So it’s a lot of fun. Please go ahead. No, you. Go ahead. Yeah? Yeah, it could be by the end of the week, they’re being drawn by the lawyers right now. They work very nicely. It would be nice to be able to do it with the Democrats, but they’re really just interested in one thing, and that’s protecting people that have not done a good job in managing cities and states, and nothing to do with COVID, or little to do. They want to be able to make up for many, many years, in some cases decades of bad management, we can’t do that. So that is what they want. They want to do that, and we don’t want to do that. No not at all, no. Well you always get sued. I mean, everything you do, you get sued. I was sued on the travel ban and we won. I was sued on a lot of things and we won. So we’ll see, yeah. Probably we get sued, but people feel that we can do it. Jeff, go ahead. I mean, I could be very much. I think that the last person Russia wants to see in office is Donald Trump, because nobody’s been tougher on Russia than I have, ever. Well, I don’t care what anybody says. Nobody with any common sense would say, “Do it.” Look at what we’ve done with our military. Look at what we’ve done in exposing the pipeline with billions of dollars going to Russia. Look at all of the things we’ve done with NATO, where I’ve raised $130 billion a year from countries that were delinquent, and now they’re paying all of this money. And the $130, by the way, $130 billion, not million, billion, goes to $400 billion over a few years. And that’s all money to protect against Russia. China would love us to have an election where Donald Trump lost sleepy Joe Biden. They would dream. They would own our country. If Joe Biden was president, China would own our country. And you said another country, what was the third country? You didn’t say that in the report. The report said Iran also, but you didn’t say that. Iran would love to see me not be president. And I’ll make the statement, if and when we win, we will make deals with Iran very quickly, we’ll make deals with North Korea very quickly. And whatever happened to the war in North Korea, you haven’t seen that have you? If I didn’t win the election in 2016, our country would now be, maybe it would be over by now, but in war with North Korea. Everybody said, “Oh, Trump will get us in war.” No, just the opposite. And we actually have a relationship with North Korea, which is something that was never established by the previous administration. You would have been in war with North Korea and it would have been a very bad war. So North Korea, whether you look at Iran, every one of them will make a deal with us very quickly. Iran is dying to make a deal, but they want to see because they’d much rather make a deal with Biden, because if they make a deal with the United States, if China makes a deal with the United States with Biden in charge, they would own our country. Look what I’ve done. I’ve taken tens of billions of dollars from China. China was having the worst year they’ve had in 67 years. And we were having the best year we’ve ever had, with big tax cuts, with big regulation cuts, we’ve rebuilt our military, we became independent in terms of energy, we’re the energy leader of the world. We were having the best year we’ve ever had. By the way, African-American, Asian-American, Hispanic-American unemployment numbers are the best in the history of our country. And many other groups too including women, including high school diploma, no high school diploma, college diploma, everybody was doing better. The last thing that Russia wants and China wants, and Iran wants, would be for Donald Trump to win. Yes please, go ahead. Well, we’re going to look at it very closely. You’re telling me that this came out a little while ago, and I’ve heard that it came out. It came out just a little while ago, and we’re going to look at that very closely, but you started off with Russia. Why don’t you start off with China? You think China is may maybe a bigger threat? I mean, I think maybe it is. I mean, you’ll have to figure it out, but we’re going to watch all of them. We have to be very careful. The biggest risk that we have is Mail-in ballots, because with the Mail-in ballot called Universal Mail-in ballots, it is a much easier thing for a foreign power, whether it’s Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, many others, people, countries you wouldn’t expect, it’s much easier for them to forge ballots and send them in. It’s much easier for them to cheat with Universal Mail-in ballots. So I think one of the things we’ll have to look at is exactly that, but that’s a big problem. That’s a big problem. You saw in New York, they called the winner, but they have no idea what the vote is. Please go ahead. No, I’m totally involved. No, they call me all the time. They tell me how they’re doing with Nancy and Chuck. But in my opinion, they’re just using it as an excuse to try and… Chuck Schumer came out with a strong statement today that you have to get back into school because it’s good for the economy, but he doesn’t do it. He doesn’t practice what he preaches. Now my people, Steven Mnuchin and our wonderful Chief of Staff, Mark Meadows, they’re constantly on the phone with me. I’m totally involved with it and we are going to do it in a way that’s just much easier. We gave them their chance, but they view it as an election enhancement. You talk about foreign countries cheating on the election. Well, the Democrats are cheating on the election because that’s exactly what they’re doing. If you look at what they’re doing even with these negotiations, that’s an influence and an unfair influence on an election. But we’re going to win anyway. Yeah. Please go ahead. We’ll see, we’ll see what happens, but right now they’re not ready and they’re not ready because frankly I don’t think they care about people. I think they care about their politicians that have done a terrible job running the cities and states, Democrat cities and states that are bleeding money, that have been so badly run. You take a look at Baltimore and you take a look at so many different cities, including the ones I’ve already mentioned. Take a look at what’s going on. And they want lots of money to keep it going. For many years, they’ve been bad. So all I’m doing is we’re having it out. We’re finally having it out. Yeah, please. Yeah, we have the money. We have the money. Yeah. I won’t say that yet. You’ll see that when it happens, but we have the money. We have it Justin. We have plenty of money. Yeah, please go ahead. No, they don't have to. It's a political activity. You’re wrong on that because it’s a political activity. They have exceptions. Political activity, and it’s also a peaceful protest. So when you have, and as you know… They asked if they could be here. And to me, they look like they all have, pretty much all have masks on. But you have an exclusion in the law. It says peaceful protest or political activity, right? In fact, specifically, yeah, it says exactly political activity or peaceful protest. And you can call it political activity, but I’d call it peaceful protest because they heard you were coming up and they know the news is fake. They understand it better than anybody. They asked whether or not they can be here. Like the question about Russia, he doesn’t mention Iran was in the report. He doesn’t mention, or he mentions very late, that China was in the report. Because that’s the way they are. If the press in this country were honest, it wasn’t corrupt, if it wasn’t fake, our country would be so much further ahead. But we’re doing really great. Thank you all very much. Thank you very much.
















"
"30","08-09-20","Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. And good afternoon. My administration has been working around the clock in good faith to reach an agreement with Democrats on additional China virus relief. Already my administration has enacted over three trillion dollars in historic relief, savings many tens of millions of dollars in jobs, and you see how fast the economy’s coming back. It does look like it’s going to be a very sharp V. We have tremendous enthusiasm, tremendous spirit, and tremendous job growth. We set a record on number of jobs in the last three months. It’s the most jobs ever created in a three month period, during a three month period. That’s great. Before we begin, I’ve just signed two bills that are great for our vets. Our vets are very special. We passed Choice, as you know, Veteran’s Choice, and Veteran’s Accountability. And they’ve been trying to get that passed for decades and decades and decades, and no president’s ever been able to do it, and we got it done so veteran’s have choice. And now you have accountability that if you don’t love your vets, if you’re in the VA and you don’t love the vets or take care of the vets, you can actually get fired if you don’t do your job. We want people that love our vets. The first expands the eligibility for vets with blindness in both eyes. So we have an expansion of benefits, an expansion of various elements of being and working with the VA for vets with blindness and in particular blindness in both eyes. We have a lot of problems with blindness in the VA, and we’re doing something about it. They’ve been talking about this for many years. So that is expanding eligibility for vets with blindness in both eyes. Okay? Second requires the VA to establish a treatment court program for vets who need treatment, rather than punishment, for certain non-violent crimes. And you know what that all means. It’s really something that they’ve been trying to get done for a long time. The second requires the VA to establish a treatment court. So this is a treatment court program for vets who need treatment rather than punishment for certain non-violent crimes. Okay? I think it’s self explanatory. We’ve wanted this for a long time, they’ve been trying to get it for a long time. And now we have it. And I want to thank everybody for helping us get that done. We had a lot of support from a lot of great people, including people in the VA. In the current negotiations, we have repeatedly stated our willingness to immediately sign legislation providing expanded unemployment benefits, protecting Americans from eviction, and providing additional relief payments to families. Democrats have refused these offers. They want to negotiate. What they really want is bailout money for states that are run by Democrat governors and mayors, and that have been run very badly for many, many years, and many decades, in fact. You know the states. Everybody knows who we’re talking about and what we’re talking about. I don’t think we have to go over it. But what the Democrats primarily want is bailout money. Has nothing to do with the China virus. It has nothing to do with anything that we’ve been talking about over the last period of time. They want to bail out states that have been badly managed by Democrats, badly run by Democrats for many years. And in fact, in all cases, many decades. And we’re not willing to do that. Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer have chosen to hold this vital assistance hostage on behalf of very extreme partisan demands and the radical left Democrats, and we just can’t do that. So hopefully we can do something with them at a later date, but we’re going to be signing some bills in a little while that are going to be very important and are going to take care of pretty much this entire situation as we know it, and as you have been covering, and in some cases actually covering it accurately. Many of the far left policies they’re pushing have nothing to do, again, with what we have been working on so hard, namely the corona… You can call it so many different names. What a horrible thing China released upon the world. One third of their bill, the Heroes Act, is spending completely unrelated money to the virus. Here are just a few of the policies in their extreme left bill. And again, this is a bill supported by Biden, and Biden is totally controlled now by the Bernie Sanders left wing of the party, and in fact he’s gone further left than Bernie Sanders ever dreamt of going. So obviously other than Bernie have brought him left. If you look at the manifesto that they’ve agreed to, it’s far further left than I’ve ever heard anything about Bernie Sanders. The massive taxpayer bailout of badly run blue states we talked about. That’s one of the things they’re looking to do. Measures designed to increase voter fraud, banning voter ID. They want to ban voter ID. We should have voter ID in every state. Every state should have voter ID. You have ID on everything you do, practically. Everybody has voter ID… Everybody has ID, except for voters. When you vote, you don’t want ID. They don’t want it. We have some states with it, it works out great. And if you want to stop fraud in elections, have voter ID. They want measures designed to increase voter fraud, which is banning voter ID in all states, and banning requirements for signature verification in federal elections. Now, why would they want in this bill, which really has nothing to do with what we’re talking about, stimulus, something banning voter ID? In every single state they want to ban it, including states where we already have it. Because we have some states where we have it. Indiana and others that do very well. Why would they want to ban voter ID in all states, and why would they want to ban requirements for signature verification in federal election? Who would want a bill banning signature verification? What’s that all about? You know what it’s about? Fraud. That’s what they want. Fraud. They want to try and steal this election. Because frankly it’s the only way they can win the election. The bill also requires all states to do universal mail in balloting, which nobody’s prepared for. Regardless of whether or not they have the infrastructure. They want to steal an election. That’s all this is all about. They want to steal the election. So in the bill they have a bill that requires all states to do universal mail in balloting, regardless of whether or not they have the infrastructure. Like in Nevada, it’s such a disaster, their infrastructure is a total disaster. They don’t want to have signature verification. They don’t want to have any of the safeguards that you need. And they don’t want to have safeguards that are so common and so basic, and even other states that we disagree with have. This Nevada thing is a mess, but we’ll see how the courts determine, what the courts determine. But they certainly don’t have the infrastructure in Nevada. So we’ll see how it is. As you know, we brought suit last week, and we’ll see how that all works out. I think we’re going to win it. But basically what they’re trying to do with all of these requirements, including no signature verification, they’re trying to steal an election. I was in Ohio, I was in Texas, I was in Florida over the last four or five days, and if you would see the crowds along the highways and the roadways, people have said they’ve never seen anything like it. And they haven’t seen anything like it. And the press doesn’t report it, because they’re fake news. They even want to force states to implement the controversial practice known as ballot harvesting. Very dangerous practice. Meaning they would allow Democrat party operatives to deposit thousands and thousands of completed ballots at the Post Office without any verification of who filled them out. Including a verification of signatures on the ballot. So you’re not even going to have a verified signature. Anybody, I could sign it, you could sign it. Anybody in this room could sign it. And that’s going to count as a vote. How can you do a thing like this? So this is what they’re asking for. This is what Nancy Pelosi and crying Chuck Schumer are asking for. Okay? That’s ridiculous. It’s horrible. That’s a horrible thing. The Democrat bill includes stimulus checks for illegal aliens. So if you are able to get in to our country illegally, and our border is, as you know, doing very well right now. We have a very strong border, and the wall is up to 276 miles. We’ll be completed with it around the end of the year. We’re going to do some extra mileage in certain areas that people didn’t realize were so bad. So, we’ll be completed with it. Right after, we’re going to do the additional mileage. We’ll do it probably a little bit after the year. I think from what I’ve heard, Joe Biden, sleepy Joe wants to rip the wall down. He wants people to pour into our country. They want to have open borders. We don’t want to have open borders. The Democrat bill includes stimulus checks for illegal aliens. They require the mass release of illegal aliens from detention. They also compel the mass release of inmates, including serious felons. How do you like that one? And this is in the bill that we’re talking about. What does this have to do with stimulus the economy? What does this have to do with the coronavirus? Know the name. What does this have to do with this? So, think of that. They require the mass release of illegal aliens from detention. What does this have to do with what we’re trying to do? They want to put this… And this is a radical left policy so that you could go to Portland, and try and rip the place apart that they’d been doing for many years. They’ve been doing for years and years. They also compel the mass release of inmates. What does this have to do with what we’re talking about? This is Nancy Pelosi, crazy Nancy, and Chuck Schumer. They want to compel you to do this stuff, and this has nothing to do with what we’re talking about. And it includes serious felons. They want to have these people released on a mass basis, including serious felons. That’s page 1,689, page 1,762. Think of that. 1,762, and that’s no way near the end of their bill. They have things in there that nobody has even at the time to look at or read. These people, I honestly don’t believe they love our country, you want to know the truth. In addition to demanding these extreme partisan provisions, Democrats are actively blocking the following measures. Support for K-12 schools to help them safely open, additional funding for the paycheck protection program to help millions of workers on the payroll. Here’s a great program. Very successful. Kept a lot of businesses open. That’s why we’re doing so well in reopening our country. Additional money for hospitals, testing and vaccines, direct payments of $3,400 for a family of four. Now, remember, this is what the extreme partisans… This is what we’re talking about. Democrats are actively blocking the things that we want, and what we want is good for people. These are things that they’re blocking. Support for K-12 schools so they could open. Think of that. Also, direct payments of the $3,400 for a family of four plus. Then, funding for child care and mental health care. And you need that, especially when you have so much of a lockdown. You need that mental healthcare. Funding for broadband, airports, and agriculture, rental assistance, and support for community banks and credit unions to help them provide $100 billion in loans to the hardest hit communities, including rural communities and farmers. They don’t want anybody to get that. Democrats are obstructing all of it. Therefore, I’m taking executive action. We’ve had it. We’re going to save American jobs and provide relief to the American workers that I’ll be signing these bills in a very short period of time. First one is I’m providing a payroll tax holiday to Americans earning less than $100,000 per year. In a few moments, I will sign a directive instructing the Treasury Department to allow employers to defer payment of the employee portion of certain payroll taxes from September 1st. And we’re actually going to be making that. We just got the word. We’re just getting word from a lot of people. We didn’t think we’d have to do this because we thought the Democrats would be reasonable, but they’d been not only unreasonable, they’ve been ridiculous. So, we’re going to make that August 1st, most likely. It’ll be August 1st. We’ll let you know the exact date, but we’re looking like August 1st. It’d be August 1st through the end of 2020. This will mean bigger paychecks for working families as we race to produce a vaccine and eradicate the China virus once and for all. And we’re doing very good with the numbers. You see it’s going down in Arizona, very, very substantially and rapidly, going down in California, going down to Texas, going down in Florida. Other areas are propping up a little bit, but we’re watching them very closely. We understand the disease, and we’re watching it very closely, especially our senior citizens and our senior citizens residences. If I’m victorious November 3rd, I plan to forgive these taxes and make permanent cuts to the payroll tax. I’m going to make them all permanent. Now, Joe Biden and the Democrats may not want that. They don’t want that because they’re adding $3 trillion in taxes. So, they’ll have the option of raising everybody’s taxes and taking this away. But if I win, I may extend and terminate. In other words, I’ll extend it beyond the end of the year and terminate the tax. And so, we’ll see what happens. Biden probably won’t be doing that. You’ll have to ask him. I don’t think he knows what he’s doing. Second, I’m signing an executive order directing the Department of Housing and Urban Development, HHS and CDC, to make sure renters and homeowners can stay in their homes. So, I’m protecting people from eviction. You’ve been hearing a lot about eviction, and the Democrats don’t want to do anything having to do with protecting people from eviction. I said, “Let’s do that separately. That can be a totally separate thing from passing along money so people can live,” and they didn’t even want to protect people from eviction. So, they would get evicted. It’s not their fault that this virus came into our country. It’s China’s fault. And came into the world. By the way, a lot of the people, a lot of the states that were doing the best are having some problems. A lot of the states that we weren’t thinking were doing the best are doing very well. You look at some of the countries involved. Some of the countries that were really standing out as examples are now exploding, but they’ll get it down. They understand it. We’re dealing with it. We’re dealing with a lot of countries. We’re providing thousands and thousands of ventilators all over the world right now. We make a lot of ventilators. We’ve started off with very little, and we’re making a lot. We have thousands in our stockpile, but we’re making thousands a month, and we’re providing many of them, thousands and thousands, to other countries that would never be able to get them. The Department of Housing and Urban Development will also provide financial assistance to struggling renters and homeowners, and work with landlords and lenders to keep Americans safely in their home. So, we don’t want people being evicted, and the bill, the act that I’m signing will solve that problem largely, hopefully, completely. The third action I’m taking today will also provide additional support for Americans who are unemployed due to the China virus. Under the CARES Act, I proudly signed, expanded unemployment benefits into law. Congressional Democrats have stonewalled our efforts to extend this relief. They even opposed measures that would give bonuses to workers returning to the job. They were totally opposed to that. For this reason, I’m taking action to provide an additional or an extra $400 per week in expanded benefits. $ 400, okay? That’s generous, but we want to take care of people. Again, it wasn’t their fault. It was China’s fault. States will be asked to cover 25% of the costs using existing funding such as the tens of billions of dollars available to them through the coronavirus relief fund. Under this plan, states will be able to offer greater benefits if they so choose. And the federal government will cover 75% of the costs. So, we’re all set up. It’s $400 per week. So we’re all set up. It’s $400 per week and we’re doing that without the Democrats. We should have been able to do it very easily with them, but they want all of these additional things that have nothing to do with helping people. Fourth, I am signing a directive providing relief to student loan borrowers. Earlier this year, we slashed student loan interest rates to zero. I don’t know if people know that because the press doesn’t ever report it, but maybe they’re watching now. The press doesn’t report a lot of good things that are good for the people and good for the country. Earlier this year, we slashed the loans interest rates to 0% and suspended student loan payments, and Congress extended that policy through September 30th. Today, I’m extending this policy through the end of the year, and we’ll extend it further than that most likely, right after December 1st. So we look like we’re going to be extending that to pay zero interest, and again, not their fault that their colleges have closed down and not their fault that they weren’t able to get what they bargained for. Through these four actions my administration will provide immediate and vital relief to Americans struggling in this difficult time, and the beautiful thing about this difficult time is we’re now coming back and setting records. We’ll also ensure that our economic comeback continues full speed ahead, and with the $400 and all of the other measures that we’re talking about, and we’ll be signing in a little while, that will happen. We’re further looking at additional tax cuts, including income tax relief, income tax cuts, and capital gains tax cuts. So we’re going to be looking at that capital gains for the purpose of creating jobs and income tax is self explanatory, and it will be income tax for middle-income and lower-income people, but middle-income people, because they pay a lot of income tax and you do have tax inequality. I’m saying that as a Republican, and you do have tax inequality. So we’re going to be looking at income tax and we’re going to be looking at capital gains tax cuts on both and maybe substantial. And we’ll be reporting back fairly shortly on that. That’s big news. That’s big news, but very important. We want to have our jobs flourish. We want to have our companies do great. We want to have the 401( k)s, which are now at a level, if you look at the stock market, it’s great. If you have stocks in NASDAQ, you’re higher than you ever were, including even this is still during the pandemic, the stock market, because they see such incredible things happening, smart people, the stock market is at almost an all-time high. We’re just short of it, and NASDAQ is higher than it ever was. It’s broken the record 14 times in the last couple of months. So 401(k)s are doing fantastically. I hope you kept your sTocks. I hope you didn’t sell. I hope you had confidence in your president and confidence that your president was going to be reelected. And I will tell you this, that the biggest tailwind, the biggest problem that we have with respect to the stock market, which is not much of a problem because it’s doing so well, but it would be actually much higher, is the possibility that these radical left Democrats could win. And if they win, we’re going to have a crash. We’re going to have a terrible problem because they’re going to raise taxes, $3 trillion worth of taxes. And that’s going to affect everybody from middle income to upper income, to jobs, to companies. Your 401(k)s will go down like a rock. Your stocks will go down like a rock. Don’t forget, these big companies, you have stocks in these companies. You own stocks. And they have millions and millions of shareholders, and whether it’s pension funds or anybody else, you all have stocks. So they’re big companies, but a lot of people own that stock and we want to keep it going. But we do have, I guess you could say not a tail wind, it’s a headwind, I guess, would be a better description, but it is, it’s a headwind. And when you think of it, in my opinion, it would be much higher. But you look at what they want to do. They want to raise everybody’s taxes, everybody, and they want to do the Green New Deal, which will decimate our country and decimate it. It’s ridiculous to do. It’s childish. I actually say the Green New Deal is childish. It’s for children. It’s not for adults. Anybody that believes in that is, I don’t know, maybe it’s politics. I don’t even think it’s good politics. They seem to think so. We’ll see how they do, but I don’t think it’s good politics that it’ll decimate our economy. We’ve learned a great deal about this virus and how to treat it. Our strategy is to aggressively shield those at the greatest risk while allowing younger and healthier citizens to safely resume work and school. I notice that some of the Democrats that I would say are very strongly on the left are now coming out and saying, we really have to open our schools for the good of the economy. I was shocked to see a couple of them. You know who they are. We urge all Americans to socially distance and avoid large crowds. And all of the things that we talk about all the time, we have to go and make sure that everything’s in good shape. We really are. We’re coming back very, very strong. We’re doing very well with the virus because all of those states that everybody thought would be in a bad position for a long time, they’re all coming down. The governors have done a great job. Don’t forget, we’re dealing with governors. Some have done a fantastic job. All have worked hard. Some have done a much better job than others, and some day if you’d like to know, I’ll give you the good ones and the bad ones. We’ll give you some good ones and some bad ones. But by contrast, the never ending lockdown being proposed by some, I guess, you could almost say almost all in the Democrat party, would inflict unimaginable harm to our people and to our health for decades to come. It’ll hurt our economy and they view that as a good thing. They actually view that as a good thing, because they’re interested in one date, November 3rd. And I actually think it’s bad politics. And I think they’re starting to come along because I’m seeing more and more people want to open up and you see the devastating results of lockdowns, too. You have depression and suicide and drugs and alcohol and bad marriages. Marriages that were very good turn out to be very bad. It’s an amazing thing. Who would think it? But people get along for 20 years, I guess they didn’t know each other very well, but now they don’t get along. You had the opposite also. You’ve had people to get along better. That’s okay, too. That we like, but the other situation is very, very, very, very bad. We’ll develop a vaccine. We’re going to have it very soon. We’re ready to distribute it and we’ve got the military ready, logistics it’s called. And we’ll end this pandemic and we will rebuild the greatest economy in the history of the world. You know, we created the greatest economy in the history of the world, the highest stock market ever, and we’re very close to getting that back. That, I have to say, is way ahead of schedule. Highest stock market ever, best employment numbers for African Americans, Asian Americans, Hispanic Americans. And by the way, Hispanic Americans just set a record for new jobs. African-Americans just set a record for new jobs, just now during the pandemic, the last month. And Asian Americans just set a record for new jobs. So we’re very proud of what’s happening and I will now sign the executive action. And then if you want, we can ask a few questions, okay, Kelly? Yeah, let me do this first and then you can do some questions after. Okay, so this is for the authorization of other needs assistance program, major disasters declaration related to the coronavirus disease. Okay, got it. So this is …The authority invested in me, this is the payment relief during the COVID-19 pandemic. And this is fighting these spread of the COVID-19 by providing assistance to renters and homeowners who are [inaudible 00:27:27] assistance. And this is: defer all payroll tax obligations. So this is your payroll tax obligations, which we’re going to end up terminating eventually, right? How many pictures can you take over there? You’re taking hundreds of pictures. What are you doing? Okay. I will, I will. So that’s the story, would anybody like a pen? Would anybody like a pen? We'll hand these out to you in the back, okay. Yes please, sir. Well, if they don’t, they don’t. That’s up to them. But if they don’t, if they don’t, that’s going to be their problem. I don’t think their people will be too happy. They have the money, so I don’t think their people will be too happy. But if they don’t, they don’t. But again, the states have the money, it’s sitting there. All right, Kelly. Well, no, it’s not a hardship. This is the money that they need. This is the money they wanted. This gives them a great incentive to go back to work. So this was much more than was originally agreed. The 600 was a number that was there and as you know, there was difficulty with the 600 number because it really was a disincentive. Yeah, go ahead please. It helps people greatly. It helps our country get back and anybody that would say anything different, I think is very foolish. Everybody wanted it, by the way the Democrats want it, the Republicans want it. They just couldn’t get it, they just couldn’t come to an agreement, but everybody wants it. And the very important thing is the people want it and the people need it, actually. Go ahead. Well, the answer is yes, but we have money to do other things. We have a lot of money that was unspent and we’ll be able to do things with the money that was unspent. We have significant money that was unspent, and we will be able to use that for different purposes. Go ahead. We think it’s going to be very rapid. We want it to be very rapid. It’s going to be distributed in a way that… Whichever the fastest way, there are various methods and it will be rapidly distributed. I didn't say that, no, no. What I said is people can do whatever they want. I guess, maybe, they’ll bring legal actions, maybe they won’t. But they won’t win. Well, I’m not saying they’re not going to come back and negotiate, they might very well come back and negotiate. Very soon. They're going to see it very soon. There it is, right there. Excuse me. Excuse me. There it is. Right there. Go ahead. Oh, I don’t think so. I think this is going to go very rapidly through the courts. If we get sued, maybe we won’t get sued. If we get sued, it’s somebody that doesn’t want people to get money. And that’s not going to be a very popular thing. You ever hear of the word obstruction? They’ve obstructed. Congress has obstructed. The Democrats have obstructed people from getting desperately needed money. Go ahead please, right here. No, no, you're finished. Go ahead, please. Please. Go ahead. Okay, excuse me. Go ahead please. Okay. Thank you very much everybody. Thank you very much.
















"
"31","08-10-20","Thank you very much. Sorry for that. there was a shooting outside of the White House and seems to be very well under control. I’d like to thank the Secret Service for doing their always quick and very effective work, but there was an actual shooting and somebody has been taken to the hospital. I don’t know the condition of the person. It seems that the person was shot by Secret Service so we’ll see what happens … And yeah. Did you have something? Go ahead. No, there were no details. We just found out just now. It was outside of the White House, this area right over here. And they’ll have details for you in a little while. Somebody is taken to the hospital. It seems that the shooting was done by law enforcement at that person, at the suspect. It was the suspect who was shot. And this just took place. A couple of people outside. I noticed a man named John Roberts, who you know very well. He reported that he heard shots. He was outside and he heard two shots. We don't know yet. We don't know. They're going to find it. We don't know that yet. No. We don't know that yet. It seems to be, yeah. It seems to be. No, we were taken just out over to the Oval Office. Just told me … When he came up, you pretty much saw it like I did. He said, “Sir, could you please come with me?” So you were surprised. I was surprised also. I think it’s probably pretty unusual, but very, very professional people that do a fantastic job as you know. So it seems to me, it seems to be, from what I was said, there was a shooting. It was a law enforcement, shot someone, seems to be the suspect. And the suspect is now on the way to the hospital. I can’t tell you the condition of the suspect. There was nobody else injured. There was no other law enforcement injured. And we’ll get onto the press conference, but I do want to thank Secret Service. They are fantastic. The job they do. From what I understand, the answer is yes. That's what I understand. I don't know. You'll have to ask them. I don't know that, no. I don’t know. You’ll have to get … They’ll have a detailed, maybe a briefing for you outside later. I don’t know. I didn’t ask that question. It might not have had anything to do with me. It might’ve been something else, but it was on the outside of the premises, the wall, as you know, the fencing, especially the new fencing they put up is very powerful, but it was on the outside of the White House. Okay? And they’ll have a full report, Secret Service. In a little while, we’ll have a full report. I don’t know. Do I seem rattled? It’s unfortunate that this is a world, but the world’s always been a dangerous place. It’s not something that’s unique. The world has been … You look back over the centuries. The world has been a dangerous place, very dangerous place, and it will continue, I guess, for a period of time. No, I feel very safe with Secret Service. They’re fantastic people. They’re the best of the best and they’re highly trained. I don’t know if anybody got to walk outside, but there were a lot of terrific looking people ready to go if something was necessary, people at the highest level of law enforcement. There’s nobody like these people. So they just wanted me to step aside for a little while just to make sure that everything was cleared outside because it was right in this area. Well, I didn’t even think about not coming back. I said, “Am I able to go back?” And they said, “You’d have to wait a little while.” I waited a little while, as you know, in the Oval Office area. And I said, “Can I get back now?” And they said, “Yes.” And they have a lot of fortification outside just in case, but it was one person. Okay? They're going to be giving you a full briefing in a little while. I can only tell you they’re going to give you a briefing. It was outside of the premises. Near the fence, but outside of the premises. Yeah, pretty close. So I was telling you that the Dow Jones and the S&P 500 are now 50% above the March level. NASDAQ is setting new records. It’s already broken the record despite the situation of having the China virus. We have new jobs are rising and unemployment is falling faster than nearly anyone thought. And over the past three months, we’ve created over 9 million jobs and that’s a record, a three months record. If you added it up, it’s a three month record by far. And we’ve beaten expectations by 12 million. We’re 12 million above expectations, which is pretty remarkable. Today we had great reports on new job openings and there’s clearly a housing boom, which has been incredible numbers in both housing and an automobile boom. We’ve rarely seen anything it and it’s going on right now in America. Inventories are at rock bottom, used car sales are at record levels, and we will have rebuilt … We’re doing a rebuilding like nobody’s ever seen. It’s a big plus for manufacturing and construction, so construction’s getting close to record territory. Manufacturing is doing very well. The car companies are doing great. Very happy for Michigan, the state of Michigan. We have a lot of car companies moving in. A lot of plants are being built and expanded in Michigan and Ohio. There is no reason why the economy can’t grow at a 20% pace in the third quarter. That would be a record. And interestingly, it will be a number that’s going to be announced before November 3rd. It gets announced probably around November 1st, which is very interesting. But it’s going to grow at a very substantial pace based on all of the numbers we’re looking at and probably a lot more substantial than we originally thought. We’re creating new incentives for working jobs. We’re also providing much needed assistance to those who are still suffering from the effects of the pandemic contraction. And the contraction is now while we have the pandemic, we have a lot of great things happening in terms of the vaccines and therapeutics, as you know. And I think we’ll be making tremendous progress over the next period of a few months and certainly before the end of the year. I think we’ll have a vaccine before the end of the year, very substantially. And we may have a therapeutic resolvement very quickly. Very, very quickly. And frankly, that’s the one I’d rather have faster because you’d go in, you’d give a transfusion or a shot to people that are very ill, and they’d be able to come out of the hospital the next day or a few days later. If the states participate in our core sharing unemployment plan, we are going to be doing something very, very interesting with all of the things that we announced on Saturday. I don’t have to repeat what they are, you know very well. And we’ve had some tremendous success already. If you look at what’s happening with the stock market and people are very thrilled at what we’re doing, we’d like to get the Democrats to focus on other than what they’re focusing on, which is a bailout of poorly running states. We have many great running states, States that are setting records. And let’s see what happens with respect to that. But we’re looking at also considering a capital gains tax cut, which would create a lot more jobs. So we’re looking very seriously at a capital gains tax cut and also at an income tax cut for middle income families. We’re looking at expanding the tax cuts we’ve already done, but specifically for middle income families. And you’ll be hearing about that in the upcoming few weeks. And I think it’ll be very exciting. So a capital gains tax is going to be a lot of people put to work and it would be a cut in the capital gains tax and also a cut in the middle income income tax. So I now want to just discuss a little quick brief, and then we’ll take a few more questions. But we took some. Who would have known we were going to take questions before we started? Is that right, Jennifer? But that’s the way it happens sometimes. We want to discuss, if we might, the China virus and the world continues its fight against this horrible plague. Countries in every continent are seeing increases in cases. We have a rapid increase only in cases where … It’s very interesting because we’re so far ahead of testing, we have more cases. If we had much smaller testing, would have fewer, but we feel that having testing is a very important thing. It’s a great record to have. In many ways we’ve tested, I guess, close to 65 million people right now. And nobody’s even close to that number. No other country is close. India would be second at 11 million and they have 1.5 billion people. So we have the number one testing anywhere in the world by far. And we also have, I think, the highest quality tests. We have a lot of different ones, but we have the highest quality including the short term and the lab tests. The lab tests take a little bit longer. And Dr. Burks was telling me a little while ago that we’re down to two days and two and a half days on getting your result on the lab tests. The other ones, you get them in five minutes to 15 minutes. So that’s exciting. But countries in every continent are seeing increases in cases in recent days. Cases have rapidly increased in Japan and Australia, unfortunately, and they’re now experiencing higher peaks than they did in March. To the south of a border, of our border, cases have continued to surge in Mexico, Central America, Argentina, Colombia, Peru, Brazil, and throughout Latin America. It’s really the hotspot. It’s posing a major challenge for this continent. Latin America is now the region with the most number of confirmed cases by far despite a relative scarcity of testing. So when you think of that, that means it’s pretty much on fire, having a hard time. We’re helping them. We’re sending them tremendous numbers of ventilators, which we’re making by the thousands every month. And we’re helping Latin America very much. It’s hard for them to come into the country because we have big sections of wall up now. The new wall is being built, which people don’t talk about. They used to talk about nothing but the wall. Now that it’s being built, they’re not talking about it so much, but it’s helped us because we’re up to almost … We’re getting close to 280 miles, 280 miles in the most important areas. So that’s helping us a lot in terms of not having people come in to the country who are infected with the coronavirus. This global trend underscores the persistence of the virus, including the nations that apply the strictest and most punishing lockdowns. You have nations that are really tough on the lockdowns and they’re getting hit very hard. That’s why my administration is pursuing a science-based approach that protects the most vulnerable, preserves hospital capacity, and focuses on the delivery and development of treatments and ultimately the vaccine. I feel strongly that we will have a vaccine by the end of the year and it’ll be put in service maybe even as we get it because we’re all set militarily. We’re using our military to distribute the vaccine and logistically there’s nobody like this group of people. I meet with them a lot and they’re ready to go. Soon as they have it, they’ll be going. But more importantly, the therapeutics, as I said, I think the therapeutics could be great. Initially speaking, I think that would be if I had my choice, but you’re going to have them both. You’re going to have a boat. You’re going to have them both very soon, too. At the same time, we urge all Americans to apply common sense mitigation. You all know what that mitigation is. Everybody knows it by heart now. Nearly half of all of the deaths from the China virus in the United States have occurred in nursing homes and longterm care facilities. That’s why we have delivered funding, equipment and rapid testing to our nation’s nursing homes to protect those at high risk. We’re very focused on nursing homes and senior citizens’ areas. Anywhere that we have senior citizens, we’re very, very focused. We’ve delivered over 1,800 rapid point of care testing devices, those are very quick, and shipped over 700,000 tests to nursing homes. Nursing homes are being protected like never before. The United States faces a unique range of challenges that requires our constant vigilance. America has the largest at risk population of any developed country by far, 1.5 million residents of nursing homes, about five times out of the United Kingdom and other European countries. Our country also has a higher prevalence of underlying conditions that this virus targets. Yet we have fewer deaths per capita than the United Kingdom and most other peer nations in Western Europe. So that’s an important, we have fewer deaths per capita than the United Kingdom and most other nations in Western Europe and heading for even stronger numbers. But one person is too much as far as I’m concerned. Should have never been allowed to happen. Should have never been allowed to escape China. Nationwide we continue to see encouraging signs. In the last seven days, nationwide cases declined by 14%. Hospitalizations decreased by 7%. Fatalities decreased by 9%. Arizona and Florida are improving rapidly with fewer patients coming to emergency rooms by far as well as decreasing cases, decreasing fatalities, and expanded hospital capacity. So we have an expanded hospital capacity. It’s pretty dramatic when you look at it, meaning we have more room, should we need it. So a lot of tremendous work has been done. In Texas, likewise, the number of patients going to emergency rooms has dropped from July by more than two thirds. That’s a lot. Nevertheless, we continue to monitor Texas very closely. Terrific governor, terrific people working on that whole situation in Texas, especially at its test positivity rate, which rose over 20% this weekend. Overall cases in Texas are coming down and have stabilized in the border counties. That’s again where you have the wall and you’re next to, in some cases the wall, in some cases you’ll have it very shortly. You’ll have it all built within a number of months. But those areas were hit very hard. And they’re likely cases from Mexico that come in, back and forth from the border. They come in illegally. As doctors have found more effective ways to treat patients, the fatality rate continues to improve. Texas has one sixth the vitality rate of New York and New Jersey that they had in April. And if you look at New York and New Jersey, they work very, very hard, but very heavy density. And they had a lot of different kinds of difficulty. The fatality rates in Florida and Arizona are between 25% and 33% of the peak rates of New York and New Jersey. Again, different climate, a different grouping, a different density, tremendously different density. In California the situation is starting to stabilize and improve throughout the major metropolitan areas. Statewide hospitalizations continue to decline very substantially with about 20% fewer inpatients now than on July 21st. California starting to really show signs of correcting. We’re monitoring regions with increasing cases including Boston, Chicago, and the Midwest. And we’re monitoring them very, very strongly and very, very hard. I do want to say that I think at the end of a fairly short period of time, you’re going to be in very, very good shape all over our country. Every loss of life is tragic and all nations must work together to defeat this horrible virus. My administration is going to continue to save as many lives as possible. We are working around the clock. Everybody, it’s incredible how hard they’re working and people from other countries, we’re working with them also and they’re working very hard. This is something that’s now attacked 188 different countries. There are a wide range of factors that determine how the virus impacts a nation such as age, underlying conditions. Underlying conditions is a very big one to you. If you’re sick in any way, if you’re, especially they say heart and diabetes, that’s not a good thing to have if you’re going to have this, if you’re going to catch it. So we’re trying to protect especially those people that have problems with their heart or diabetes and levels of preexisting immunity resulting from past exposure to other viruses which happens. We must stop politicizing the virus and instead be united in our condemnation of how this virus came to America, how this virus came to the world and we’re going to figure it out and we’re going to find out and we’re very angry about it. On the therapeutics and vaccine updates, three vaccine candidates are currently in phase three clinical trial, something that would have been impossible under the previous administration or any other administration. And several others are showing considerable promise. We have great companies, very well known companies. I think everyone in this room would know these companies, but they’re the biggest and the best in the world. And we’re working with other foreign companies and countries that have been really working very closely with us. We’re trading, we’re not looking to do anything but come up with the answer and we really don’t, we don’t care. We want to come up with the answer. If it’s one of ours or one of theirs, it’s okay. We have to come up with the answer and we’re very close to getting it. Some people think we have it. We may have it. We have the best scientists in the world racing to develop a safe vaccine that will end this pandemic, save millions of lives and that’s millions of lives all over the world and then the harm inflicted by this virus to our society and to all other nations. Last week, the NIH began a clinical trial of remdesivir paired with another approved antiviral drug and anti-inflammatory drug. You know that remdesivir has been very successful. And now they’re experimenting with others, including antivirals and antiinflammatories, and they’re having some very interesting success. We’ve secured enough remdesivir to treat over 650,000 patients. On Saturday I took executive action in a signing to save American jobs and support American workers. I signed directives to give a payroll tax holiday with the understanding that after the election, on the assumption that it would be victorious for an administration that’s done a great job, we will be ending that tax, will be terminating that tax. On the other hand, the other group wants to raise taxes and they may want to leave it where you pay it. But the payroll tax is a big deal for people. It’s a tremendous saving for people and we’re going to be doing it. And we intend to terminate it at the end of the appropriate period of time. It’s for those making less than $100,000 through the end of 2020, to provide an extra $400 per week also in unemployment benefits and to extend the freeze on home evictions. We want to extend the freeze so people aren’t evicted. It’s not their fault that the virus came from China. It’s China’s fault and to suspend payments on student loans through the end of the year and then beyond. And again, they’re paying interest on loans and they’re not allowed to go to their college. So we’re going to suspend payments on student loans through the end of the year, and then another extension most likely, because it’s not fair to the students to have to pay when the colleges aren’t doing the job of getting open. And I think probably many of them could be open. So I want to thank you all. I’m sorry for the disturbance before. Things happen and if you’d like, we’ll take a few questions. Yeah. Steve, what do you think? By the way, the gentleman you know everybody, you know Russell, you know. But this is Scott Atlas. You know that, right? Scott is a very famous man who’s also very highly respected, Stanford. And he’s working with us and will be working with us on the coronavirus. And he has many great ideas and he thinks what we’ve done is really good. And now we’ll take it to a new level. And so it’s great to have Scott working along with us and we appreciate it very much, Scott. Thank you very much really [inaudible 00:10:52]. We’ve had some great discussions. We just had a meeting with the governors and they were very anxious to get money for the people in their states. And if they, depending on the state, we have the right to do what we want to do. We can terminate the 25% or we don’t have to do that. So we’ll see what it is. It depends on the individual state, but a lot of money will be going to a lot of people very quickly. And I’ve instructed the Secretary of the Treasury to move as quickly as he can, right? So we’ll get it done. Yeah, please. Well, I don’t know if he was closer or not, he or she. I don’t know if it was a he or she, but I have such confidence in these people. They’re so good. And I don’t think the person breached anything. He was on the outside ground. So I don’t believe anything was breached. I asked that question. So they were relatively far away. No, because they may have, as you would call it a case and maybe a case, but it’s also a case where there’s a tiny, it’s a tiny fraction of death, tiny fraction, and they get better very quickly. Yeah, they may have it for a short period of time. But as you know, the seriousness of it in terms of what it leads to is extraordinarily small, very, very much less than one percent. Jonathan. Yeah. I think that for the most part, they do very well. I mean, they don’t get very sick. They don’t catch it easily. They don’t get very sick. And according to the people that I’ve spoken to, they don’t transport it or transfer it to other people, or certainly not very easily. So yeah, I think schools have to open. We want to get our economy going. We have incredible numbers despite this. If we could get this going, I think it’s a very important thing for the economy to get the schools going. Jonathan, go ahead. Well, if you look at the manifesto that they’ve come up with, and if you look at their stance on religion and things having to do very importantly with aspects of religion and faith, I don’t think a man of deep religion would be agreeing to the Bernie Sanders plan. You take a look at what they have in, and you can’t put that into the realm of a religious group of people. I will say that. And I think it’s one of the reasons why, if you look at polls, which I’m not a big believer in polls. If I was, I guess I wouldn’t be standing here right now. And by the way, our poll numbers are going up very rapidly, as you know. And Joe’s are going down very rapidly. He’ll have to come out of the basement, it looks like pretty soon. Because it’s one of those things. But no, if you look at the manifesto. I call it the manifesto, a lot of people are calling it the manifesto. My opinion is further left than where Bernie was before. So normally he’d be left and you’d bring it somewhere a little bit toward the center. But some of the things that they have down there, and I’m not only talking in terms of religion, I’m not talking even in terms of religion. But some of the things they have in the agreement made, and this wasn’t agreement made by Bernie Sanders and Joe, it’s a terrible thing. It would be a terrible thing for our country. It will destroy our country. We will go into a depression. We will put on regulation. We will double and triple taxes. It will be terrible for healthcare. Just terrible. You’ll have 180 million people lose their healthcare. It will be a terrible, terrible thing for our country. Okay. Yeah, please. Yeah. But I didn’t say that. I said as an executive order. As you said, I said as an executive order it hasn’t been done before. We want to be able to assure people that preexisting condition is always taken care of. As you know, we’ve done tremendous things having to do with the individual mandate. We got rid of the individual mandate from Obamacare. Which really ended Obamacare as it would be officially known, because the individual mandate was the biggest part. It was also the most unpopular part, where you pay for a terrible privilege of overpaying for insurance. You pay not to have to pay for your healthcare. And that was a disaster for people, and very unpopular. That was called the individual mandate. And we terminated that. And officially terminated that. And that was something that we have been given thanks for it by many, many people. But the individual mandate will always be with us, the individual mandate termination will always be, they can’t start it up. In fact, I don’t even believe, you’ll have to tell me, I don’t believe it’s been challenged when we ended it. And preexisting conditions, the Republicans are 100% there. And I’ll be issuing, at some point in the not too distant future, a very strong statement on that. Probably in the form of an executive order. Just a double safety net, and just to let people know that the Republicans are totally strongly in favor of taking care of people with preexisting conditions. It’s a signal to people. It’s a second platform. We have preexisting conditions will be taken care of 100% by Republicans and the Republican party. I actually think it’s a very important statement. Yes, please. No, we haven’t sent out invitations. We’re talking to them. As you know, I was on the phone with many of them yesterday with respect to Lebanon, which is truly one of the saddest, most catastrophic things I’ve ever seen. And they have no idea how many people have died. They’re having revolution right now in that country. It’s just a terrible thing. But I was, yesterday, eight o’clock in the morning our time, we had a big teleconference call. Some of those people were there. I’m much more inclined to do it sometime after the election, we were going to do it in September. They’d like to do it. We could do it through teleconference or we could do it through a meeting. But I am now suggesting, I told my people yesterday actually, why don’t we do it sometime after the election when things are a little bit … you have a little more time to think about it? Because it’s very important. [crosstalk 00:31:50] The G7 is very important. I don’t know, but we have invited a number of people to the meeting. I certainly would invite him to the meeting, I think he’s an important factor. But we will invite certain people that aren’t in the G7. Some people have already accepted, but we’re going to be doing it after the election. I think it’s a better atmosphere to have a G7. I think it’s just a better, calmer atmosphere to have a G7. Yeah, please. They’re hurting people very badly. This would have been so easy for them to do. And I saw that Senator Schumer said today on a show, I don’t know what show, but he said today on a show that we should meet, we should do something. But where has he been for, how many weeks have you been negotiating? Like four? And they should do something. It would have been so much easier than doing it the way we did it. But we did something that’s very important. And frankly, it’s been well received, very well received. Go ahead, please. Well I’ve been to Gettysburg numerous times. It’s a national park. It’s a national historic site. It’s incredible. You know, it’s the history. It’s incredible actually, to me. It was a very important place, and is a very important place in our country. So we’re looking at that, and we’re looking at the White House. The White House would be very much easier for secret service. You see what just went on here, they’re all here. Just like you have your seats, they have their seats at the White House. So there wouldn’t be any expense or any extraordinary expense. And the White House would be a lovely place to do it also. Least expensive place that you could do it would be at the White House. This is a government expense. And look, I watch also with governments, I watch to make sure that we do what’s right. But we’re looking at Gettysburg and we’re looking at the White House. And we have other sites too, but I think these would be two really beautiful sets. Jennifer. You could. You have plenty of room at both locations. I see John Roberts. John, you were outside, you said you heard shots fired before. And there were shots pretty much. You definitely know the difference. I know that. You know the difference. You thought they were shots, John? I saw your report inside, when I went inside. It was a good report too. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Jennifer, please. Well we’ve already responded in many different ways. We’re talking a lot about China. We shouldn’t have been talking about China. We did a phase one deal and it was a wonderful deal. And all of a sudden it means very little in the overall import of things. They should have never allowed what happened to the world, including us. But this was released into Europe and it was released into the US, and it was released all throughout the world. But it wasn’t released into China. And we were doing numbers that just were incredible. And we hope to be able to do them, perhaps even next year. I think we’re going to have an incredible year next year, but that will never pay for the loss of life in our country and all over the world. So we view China differently than we did eight months ago. Very much [crosstalk 00:36:00] differently. Yes, please. But also-And Jennifer, we’re also talking on the WTO, the World Trade Organization. China’s treated much differently than we are. This should have been handled many years ago when it first happened, but they are treated as a nation that’s developing. And they’re treated as what they call a developing nation, which gives them tremendous incentives and advantages over and above what the United States gets. And over and above what other countries get also. This is a developing nation. I don’t think so. I don’t think for purposes of what we’re talking about it should be. And we are putting in, and we’ve already put in a request that China should no longer be declared a developing nation, that it have advantages over the US. And I told them that a year ago, and I told them that two years ago. And we put it in very powerfully that they should not have advantages over other countries, frankly. And they’re not going to have any more advantages over… This should have been done by numerous presidents a long time ago, because it gives them a tremendous boost over everybody else. And it’s a very unfair situation. No, we are upset with China because of what they did. China was not good. And China will be, if you look at what’s going to happen, whether it’s Iran, Iran will make a deal with us in a month after the election’s over if we win the election. But their greatest dream in the world is that Joe Biden wins, because they will own this country. China will own this country. North Korea will own this country. They will own our country. And they’re all waiting to see the election. And if we have a win on November 3rd, we will have a deal with, in my opinion, Iran within one month. And I don’t know that we want to have a deal with China, to be honest with you. So I’m saying it myself, gee, but China wants us to lose very badly. And you know who else is not happy with us winning? Russia. The phony people that tell the story, the fake news stories about Russia. It was just reported the numbers, I raised $400 million extra in NATO. You know that. It went from 130 to $400 billion, and that’s a year, in order to strengthen up NATO. That’s a year, in order to strengthen up NATO. Nobody says that. We became the biggest energy exporter. We are now… if you look at what we have, we’re energy independent. So many different things. Our military is stronger than it ever was. We spent $2.5 trillion on our military. I exposed the terrible deal between Germany and Russia on the pipeline. Nobody even knew about the pipeline. Nord Stream. Nord Stream, too. Nobody knew about it. Nobody talks about it. I said, “What’s this all about?” So we protect Germany from Russia and Germany pays Russia, billions of dollars a year for energy. And it’s a big portion of Germany’s energy. If I was a person that was a German citizen, I would not be happy with that deal, because they were at a very big disadvantage. So, no, Russia would not be happy. And I can tell you that China would not be happy at all. We’ve taken in tens of billions of dollars as your head of the treasury, Steve, right? We’ve taken in tens of billions of dollars from China. We never took 25 cents from China, never, not even 25 cents. And $28 billion we gave to our farmers because they were targeted by China. They were actually targeted and we gave $28 billion compliments of China to our great farmers and ranchers, because they were unfairly targeted by China in order to make a better deal with us. I said, “We’re not going to do that. We’re going to, instead of making a better deal, we’re going to tariff you at very high numbers, 25%, 10%, and actually numbers that could go up a lot.” And we had a lot of money left over after giving the 28 billion to the farmers and ranchers and some others, frankly, we had many, many billions of dollars leftover and we’re still receiving that money. Even though we made the deal, we’re still receiving that money. So if we win the election, we’ll have deals with a lot of countries, very fast. They’re just waiting to see who wins because they are hoping, they are hoping that Joe Biden wins. Sleepy Joe. And if he wins, you know what’s going to happen? China will own us. Our markets will crash. The 401ks will go down to practically nothing. Stocks will go down to practically nothing. Remember stocks, there’s these big companies, they’re owned by millions of people that are carpenters and policemen and farmers and lots of other people. And they are the ones that benefit by having a good stock market, probably more than anybody else. But the 401ks, the stocks, the economy will be in a shambles. They want to raise taxes. They want to triple taxes. They want to raise the corporate tax, but they want to raise all taxes. Ultimately, they can’t pay for what they want to do anyway. And what they’re going to do is destroy your health care and destroy so many other things. We’re going to have 180 million people that are so happy with their private health care. They’re going to lose it under this crazy plan that these people are proposing. You will have a crash like you’ve never seen before. And I’ve been very good at predicting these things. Yeah, please go ahead. They said China, Russia, Iran, and probably others. But because of the fake news, they seem to think Russia plays the best. So, what they do… it’s all right. Well, I’m just saying the way the politicians… look the other day, they said the three countries. They said China and Russia and Iran, and some reporter got up and said, “Russia is meddling.” I said, “Well, didn’t it mention China and Iran? Why didn’t you mention them too?” So, I don’t know. You know what I’m telling you? I’ll tell you who’s meddling in our elections. The Democrats are meddling by wanting and insisting on sending mail in ballots where there’s corruption all over the place. If you check what happened in New York, a small, relatively small race with Carolyn Maloney, and they called her the winner the other day, because I was mentioning it at conferences and getting a lot of action on that statement, so they called her… they declared her the winner and they have no idea who won. And the person, her opponent is very angry, but they had mail in voting and they had hundreds, and I think even thousands of ballots that are missing that were fraudulent. Take a look at the Carolyn Maloney race. Take a look at Patterson, New Jersey. Take a look now at this one in Virginia, where they mailed out 500,000 applications and they’re going to people that aren’t supposed to be getting an application. Yeah, please, go ahead. Right. We’re trying to do the best we can. You have big sporting events and that’s good for our economy. That’s good for us. And they do talk about certain exemptions and they make sure everyone’s perfectly tested and everyone comes in at 100%. But we do make certain accommodations because you do have star athletes, and that means a good thing for the country. That’s economic development, et cetera. But we are working very closely with Europe and with other countries to see what’s the best time. And don’t forget, I was the one that turned Europe off because they really… they led the way they let it much more so than we did. We were months following them. And in terms of they got hit earlier than we did, quite a bit earlier than we did. So I put the restrictions on Europe. I put the restrictions on China, which was a great thing to do in retrospect. We’re getting, I mean, that was a very important day. Dr. Fauci said that was one of the most important days. And a lot of people didn’t want me to do it, but we first put a ban on anybody from China coming in. And then we put a ban on Europe coming in, but we’re working very closely with Europe to see when that will all come off. Yeah, please. No, I wouldn’t have done that. I think it’s been amazing what we’ve been able to do. If we didn’t close up our country, we would have had 1.5 or 2 million people already dead. We’ve called it right now, we don’t have to close it. We understand the disease. Nobody understood it because nobody’s ever seen anything like this. The closest thing is in 1917, they say right. The great pandemic certainly was a terrible thing where they lost anywhere from 50 to 100 million people probably ended the Second World War. All the soldiers were sick. That was a terrible situation. And this is highly contagious. This one is highly, highly contagious. Now, if I would have listened to a lot of people, we would have kept it open. And by the way, we keep it open now all the way. We keep it open. But we would have kept it open and you could be up to 1.5 or 2 million people right now. 1.5 to 2 million people. Our people have done a fantastic jobs. Our consultants and our doctors, and with disagreements and with a lot of things happening. What we’ve done with ventilators has been amazing. What we’ve done with medical equipment has been incredible. We’ve supplied the governors, nobody, not one person in this country that needed a ventilator didn’t get it. And at the beginning there was a big shortage of ventilators. Nobody had stockpiles or anything comparable to what you had to have. So we would have lost… if you think about it, you had mentioned 160,000 people and multiply that times 10 right now. I think it would have been unsustainable and unacceptable, but that’s what would have happened. Had we kept it open. So, no, I think we’re a very large country. We are… one person, and I say it all the time, a lot of people like to leave that out, one person is too many. It should have never happened, but they’ve done a really, an extraordinary job. They’ll never be given the credit, and I’m not talking about me. The people that have worked on this so hard will never be given the credit, but they’ve done an extraordinary job with a very large, diverse country, really an extraordinary job. And a lot of the governors who, as you know, they sort of do the micro in their states and they go up. And I think I can tell you that a lot of the governors have done an extraordinary job too. Yeah, please go ahead. Thank you. Did-You have to-you can't. Yeah. We haven’t really discussed that too much, but at some point we probably will be, and we don’t want people tariffing us. And if they tariff us, although I must tell you, I have a very good relationship with President Bolsonaro. He’s great. And I hear he’s doing well. He’s recovered from having COVID, having COVID-19 as they say, and that’s great and send him my regards. I think that as far as Brazil is concerned, if they do tariffs, we have to have an equalization of tariffs. And we are going to be presenting something having to do with tariffs and fairness and fair tariffs, because we have many countries for many years that have been charging us tariffs to do business, and we don’t charge them. And it’s called reciprocity. It’s called reciprocal tariffs. And you may be seeing something on that very soon. Did you have one? Orianne, please? Thank you very much. Well, look, the Obama campaign spied on our campaign and they’ve been caught. All right. And now let’s see what happens to them, but they have been caught. They’ve been caught red handed. It’s probably treason. It’s a horrible thing they did. It probably never happened before, at least nobody got caught doing it. But they use the intelligence agencies of our country to spy on my campaign and they have been caught. And there are a lot of people involved. I don’t want to say how much she’s involved. Frankly, if he chooses her, that’s fine. But that’s a potential liability. We’ll see. But President Obama knew about it. Joe Biden knew about it. Comey knew about it. Brennan Clapper, the whole group, they all knew about it. Lisa Page, her lover, Strzok, they all knew about it. And we have it documented. We have it in texts. We have it in all sorts of forms. They knew about it. It was a terrible thing. Should have never happened and should never be allowed to happen again to a president. This should never happen again. This was a setup like we’ve never seen. I think it’s a political crime of the century and they’ve been caught. So let’s see what happens to them all. Thank you very much. Thank you.
















"
"32","08-11-20","Nice to be with you all. Good evening. Before providing today’s update on the China virus. I want to address the violence, looting and rioting taking place in the Democrat controlled cities of New York, Portland, Chicago, and Seattle. The mayors and governors of these states and cities have an absolute duty to use all resources necessary to end the violence and all of the injury and death. New York City has an army of great police. I know them very well and the law enforcement and the New York’s finest are as good as it gets, and they should be allowed to do their job. If they do the job, if they’re allowed to do their job, the New York City problem will be solved and be solved quickly. They do it well. The mayor, Bill de Blasio should immediately hire back all of the police who were fired. Without justification, they were fired. I guess that’s part of defund the police by the Democrats. They should hire New York City’s finest back. You have some incredible policemen doing specific jobs that nobody else can do actually when it comes to terrorism and other things. Together, the city of Chicago and the state of Illinois have 25,000 police officers, sheriffs and guardsmen available to quell any violence. They can do it very quickly, very easily if allowed to do their jobs. Again, if allowed to do their jobs. Our police, our law enforcement is incredible, but they have to be allowed to do the jobs, the Democrats, or the radical left Democrats who are both because they’re becoming one and the same. If you look at election results, the Democrats are being taken over by the radical left. The city of Portland and the state of Oregon have 10,000 fine officers and guardsmen available. Seattle, Washington, and Washington State have 10,000 available. So Seattle, city of Seattle and Washington State itself, they have great people. They have to be allowed to do their job. I’m urging them to deploy these resources, to protect their citizens and to stop the violence and all of the things that we watch on television going on. Although, a lot of the unfortunately fake news don’t like to put it on, because it shows that the Democrats are doing a very bad job of law enforcement. They have to put it on. They have to be honest with the people of this country. But I’m offering all available federal support requested to stop the violence and arrest the criminals. We have to be asked by the governors or the mayors, and we’ll be there very rapidly. It’s ready, willing, and able. We’re all ready, willing, and able to go to these jurisdictions and take care of them. We’ll do them very quickly. You saw what happened in Minneapolis. They ripped the city apart. When the National Guard went in, it ended immediately. It was immediate and lasted. These acts of destruction are not isolated incidents, but demonstrate the pattern of violent left-wing extremism that you get to see if you’re watching the right news program. Under any rational definition, the arson attack on the police precinct in Portland would be considered an act of left-wing domestic terrorism. They really are anarchists these are left-wing anarchists. They are anarchists and I’m directing the Department of Justice to stop these anarchists immediately to stop them and to work with the city and the state to get the job done. Local authorities have to investigate and prosecute all of these crimes immediately. We’ll work with you and the local authorities know who they are. They know where they come from. They know a lot about them. They ought to get their act together and get it done, and we’re ready to help. If you need that help, you shouldn’t need that help actually, you should be able to do it yourselves and get it done very well. Again, you have excellent police and law enforcement, but you have to let them do their job. What you’re seeing in Portland, in Seattle, New York, Chicago is really the Democrat roadmap for America. They want every city in America to resemble Portland in a form. They want to pass federal legislation, gutting and hamstringing every police department in America. They want to get rid of your second amendment. They want to end cash bail, close prisons, defund police departments, or at least largely defund. You see that with New York, a billion dollars they took out of their police department and crime has gone through the roof. And appoint far-left prosecutors who side with the criminals and target law-abiding citizens. If the left gains power, no city town or suburb in our country will be safe. On the vaccine front, some very good news. Today I met with the leaders of Operation Warp Speed, our historic undertaking to produce a safe and effective vaccine in record time. We heard an update from the top scientist in the government and the leaders of pharmaceutical companies, which right now aren’t too thrilled with me. They’re taking millions of dollars worth of ads because I’ve created a favored nation status for drugs, which is going to reduce drug prices by 40, 50, 60, and maybe even 70% in some cases. Numbers that have never been heard of a thought of. So when you see those ads, remember that means your drug prices are coming down. And when you see ads attacking your president, it’s very simple. That means drug prices are going to be falling very soon. This evening, I’m pleased to announce that we have reached an agreement with Moderna to manufacture and deliver 100 million doses of their coronavirus vaccine candidate. The federal government will own these vaccine doses. We’re buying them. Recently. We also secured partnerships with Johnson & Johnson, as well as Sanofi and GSK to support the large scale manufacturing of their vaccines. Doing very well in those vaccines. Tremendous promise in every single one of them and we have many of them. And they’re years ahead of schedule. This would have been if it were in the previous administration or any of the previous administrations, where we are now would have taken years. Three vaccine candidates are now in phase three trials already. The final stage of clinical trials. This is the final stage. We are investing in the development and manufacture of the top six vaccine candidates to ensure a rapid delivery. The military is ready to go. They’re ready to deliver a vaccine to Americans as soon as one is fully approved by the FDA. And we’re moving very close to that approval. We’re on track to rapidly produce 100 million doses as soon as the vaccine is approved and up to 500 million shortly thereafter. So we’ll have 600 million doses. Operation Warp Speed is the largest and most advanced operation of its kind anywhere in the world and anywhere in history. We’ve treated more than 86,000 Americans with convalescent plasma. A recent Mayo Clinic study found that this treatment may produce results, which are incredible. We look to a reduction and reduce mortality rate by 50% and possibly even more than 50%. I urge Americans who have recovered from the virus to go to coronavirus.gov and sign up and donate. We would really appreciate that because it’s been very successful, unbelievably successful, and we would love you to go and donate. As we continue to confront the global pandemic, the United States economy is rebounding with strength like nobody thought possible. You’ve seen the numbers. You see what’s going on yesterday, today and tomorrow. In my opinion, we’re very poised for a great third quarter and very poised for some great stock market numbers and 401k numbers, and everything else. Today, the Dow Jones passed 28,000 points for the first time. More than a 50% surge since just March. So we’ve increased by 50% more than since just March. It has gained approximately 9,500 points, that same period March and has recovered nearly all of its value since the virus struck our nation. Think of that. America’s economy is incredible and its economic recovery is outpacing our peer nations. Last quarter, the European Union’s GDP decline was nearly 40% worse than the United States. So it’s 40% worse than the United States. We’ve built such a strong base that we’re able to do things and sustain better than anybody in the world by far. France’s GDP decline was nearly 80% worse than ours and Spain experienced an economic contraction twice as severe as the United States. Nationwide, we continue to see improvements in our fight against the pandemic. Very substantial improvements. Since last week, 87% of the counties in the United States report decline in cases. Think of that. 87% of the counties in the United States, they reported decline in cases. Mortality has declined by 7% and hospitalizations are declining rapidly. States that were primary hotspots, such as Florida, Texas, and Arizona have reduced cases by nearly 25%, but all Americans must remain vigilant practice good hygiene, socially distance, wear a mask whenever possible. Whenever you are getting too close to people, wear a mask and protect the elderly. Always protect the elderly. Since the end of July, the seven-day average for cases in the United States has fallen by nearly 20%, but the virus continues to increase in nations across the globe. Last week, France and Germany both recorded their highest daily number of new cases in three months. Not that I want to bring that up, but might as well explain it to the media. The seven-day case average for Germany has increased by 62% since last week, unfortunately, and that is truly unfortunate. Its increased 82% in France, 113% in Spain and 30% in the United Kingdom. Those are big increases. Cases are also rapidly increasing in the Netherlands, Sweden, Belgium, Switzerland, Slovakia, Estonia, and other European countries. And in our country, they’re going down. We will be seeing that even more rapidly as time goes by in short time. Even though America has the largest at-risk population, including 1.5 million residents of nursing homes, about five times that of other European countries. Europe has experienced a nearly 40% higher excess mortality rate than the United States. We also have fewer deaths per capita, excluding the disastrous deaths from the New York Tri-state area, which had a very, very hard time and did better than our peer nations of Western Europe. Thanks to our excellent and highly advanced medical care and skill. Something that the news doesn’t tell you. They don’t tell you that. They don’t like to tell you that. The United States has now conducted more than 66 million tests, far more than any other nation in the world. India, which has a population of 1.5 billion people has done 24 million. So we’re at 66 million and think of that. India is at 24 million and India’s second. The entire region of Latin America comprising 33 countries has conducted 25 million tests. Yet, Latin America has more confirmed cases by far than the United States. As we safely restore a great economy and reopen our schools and hopefully we can watch colleges play football. We want to get football in colleges. These are young, strong people. They won’t have a big problem with the China virus. So we want to see college football start and hopefully a lot of great people are going to be out there. They’re going to be out there playing football and they’ll be able to fight it off, and hopefully it won’t bother them one bit. Most of them will never get it statistically, but we know we’ll see more cases at some point and we will eventually develop sufficient immunity in addition to everything else that we’re doing. So college football, get out there and play football. People want to see it and stand for your American flag, stand for your national anthem. Because people are not happy when that doesn’t happen. You look at the NBA and what’s happening with the NBA and their poor ratings. I don’t know. I can’t imagine why, but they didn’t stand, they didn’t show respect to our flag. They didn’t show respect to our national anthem. And maybe that’s having an impact, but just not good. The NFL had its problems two years ago when that happened, they went way down in their ratings and their fans and they struggled back. And now all of a sudden they’re putting themselves in the same position. So stand for your flag and stand for the national anthem. And I think you’re going to do fantastically well. Because a lot of people aren’t going to watch if you don’t, I’m one of them. That’s why our strategy and attention are focused on preventing the cases that are most likely to require discussing the opening of schools, hospitalization, or produce any death. We have to maintain vigilance over our elderly population. We’ve learned that I think more than any single event, Scott. We have to be very vigilant all over, but we have to really protect our elderly population and especially our elderly population that has problems with heart, lung, any form of sickness, diabetes in particular. And we are at the same time in very good shape with respect to hospital room and hospital overcrowding. We’re in great shape. On the nursing home front, protecting our nursing home residents is a critical focus of our strategy. HHS recently announced that they will use the Provider Relief Fund to deliver an additional $5 billion to further protect nursing homes and long-term care facilities. As they continue to combat the China virus. We have delivered over 1,800 rapid point-of-care testing devices to nursing homes. And we were in the process of delivering these devices to all 15,000 Medicare and Medicaid certified nursing homes by the end of September. So they’re going to have very, very rapid tests. They won’t have to wait around two or three days or four days. And that number has come down very substantially compared to what it was when you send it to the labs. You get very accurate tests, but it takes a period of time to send it, to check it and then to send it back. But we are now at a position where we’re sending very, very rapid tests, five minutes to 15 minutes. We will care for America’s seniors as we develop the vaccine and therapeutics and therapeutics are coming along very, very well. We think we have some great answers on therapeutics and you’ll be hearing that about them in the very near future. I’m very much into the world of therapeutics, where you go into the hospital and you give a shot or you do what you have to do with perhaps transfusion, and it’s combinations of what you can do and people get better. I like that very much. I like that very, very much. And that could even proceed in getting it. That will, I think probably even proceed vaccines. But therapeutically, we’re doing very, very well. A lot of people are going to be very happy when they see some of the numbers that I’m seeing and some of the results. So tremendous things are happening on the vaccine front, at the therapeutic front. And our country should be very proud of itself. We’re going to get it delivered very rapidly as soon as it comes out. Okay. Questions please. So we are not allowing that to happen. We’re stopping evictions. We are stopping evictions. We’re not going to let that happen. We’re not going to evict people. We’re not going to let people, the Democrats, maybe they don’t care, but I care. And we signed an executive order. You know that, right? And we are not letting people be evicted. Please. Sure. That she was a what? Well, she lied. I mean, she said things that were untrue. She is a person that’s told many, many stories that weren’t true. She’s very big into raising taxes. She wants to slash funds for our military at a level that nobody can even believe. She is against fracking. She’s against petroleum products. I mean, how do you do that and go into Pennsylvania or Ohio or Oklahoma or the great state of Texas? She’s against fracking. Fracking’s a big deal. She’s in favor of socialized medicine, where you’re going to lose your doctors. You’re going to lose your plan. She wants to take your healthcare plans away from 180 million Americans. 180 million Americans that are very happy with their health insurance and she wants to take that away. So she was my number one pick. I mean, as they would say, because hopefully you’ll start college football. She was my number one draft pick. And we’ll see how she works out. She did very, very poorly in the primaries as you know. She was expected to do well. She ended up at right around 2% and spent a lot of money. She had a lot of things happening. And so I was a little surprised that he picked her. I’ve been watching her for a long time. And I was a little surprised. She was extraordinarily nasty to Kavanaugh, Judge Kavanaugh then, now Justice Kavanaugh. She was nasty to a level that was just a horrible thing, the way she was. The way she treated, now Justice Kavanaugh. And I won’t forget that soon. So she did very poorly in the primaries and now she’s chosen. So let’s see how that all works out. I can’t tell you what she’s voting for. I don’t think she knows what. I think Joe knows even less than she does, but I was only surprised at the pick. A lot of people would say that might be the pick. I was more surprised than anything else because she did so poorly. Many people did much better than her in the primary. She did very poorly in the primaries and that’s like a poll. That’s like a poll. Go ahead. Tremendous FISA abuse. So as far as FISA abuse is concerned, there was tremendous FISA abuse. It’s amazing that it’s taken this long. And everyone knows that it’s been proven very substantially. Not only FISA abuse, changing documents and putting documents in front of the FISA court in courts that are disgraceful that they could have done it. And the fact is we caught Joe Biden, President Obama, the whole group. You can look at Brennan, Comey and Clapper, the whole group. We caught then spying on our campaign. This was an illegal act like no other illegal act. This was treason. This was at the highest level of treason and Obama and Biden got caught spying on my campaign using intelligence agencies of the United States government to do it, both before and after the election. So before the election, then after I won, they continued. It’s totally illegal activity and now we just have to see happening. But as far as Kamala is concerned, she’s a big tax raiser. She’s a big slasher of funds for our military. And she’s got a lot of difficult things that she’s going to have to explain. Plus she was very, very nasty too. One of the reasons it surprised me, she was probably nastier than even Pocahontas to Joe Biden. She was very disrespectful to Joe Biden and it’s hard to pick somebody that’s that disrespectful. When she said things during the debates, during the Democrat primary debates that were horrible about Sleepy Joe. And I would think that he wouldn’t have picked. OAN please. Well, I think that Seattle in spite of all that they’ve been through with the embarrassment of having a radical left group, Antifa and others take over a big portion of the city of Seattle. We’re talking about a big city, a major city that they allowed that to happen is incredible. That it took so long to fix is incredible. The only reason they went in is because they knew we were going in the following day. And so they preceded us. They didn’t that to happen. They didn’t want to be embarrassed and the people just gave up. They were exhausted from having taken over a city for so long. The police commissioner seems like a very good woman. They were going to slash her salary by 40 or 50%. And they cut a tremendous amount off the police department. Really where people are saying it’s not sustainable as a good police department. And again, those police are good also, but they’re not allowed to do their job. So I think it’s a shame. I hate to see her go because she did in her own way, a very good job. But she wasn’t effective in convincing the mayor and the city council to give the funds that were needed or just leave the funds the way they are. They’ve done a big defund, a big part of it. And it’ll probably get worse before people realize this is a tragic era before people start dying and getting hurt very badly. So I think Seattle’s made a tragic mistake. I think Portland has no clue as to what they’re doing, they have no clue. And hopefully they’ll be asking for help because we can solve their problem very, very quickly. Yeah. Go ahead. Well, I like Vice President Mike Pence much better. He is solid as a rock. He’s been a fantastic vice president. He’s done everything you can do. He’s respected by every religious group, whether it’s evangelical, whether it’s any other group, they respect Mike Pence. He’s been a great vice president and I will take him over Kamala. And the horrible way she, again, treated Justice Kavanaugh. That was a horrible event. I thought it was terrible for her. I thought it was terrible for our nation. I thought she was the meanest, the most horrible, most disrespectful of anybody in the U.S. Senate. She’s also known from what I understand as being just about the most liberal person in the U.S. Senate. And I would’ve thought that Biden would have tried to stay away from that a little bit because with what they are doing with open borders and sanctuary cities where they’re trying to protect sanctuary cities, which is also protecting large number of criminals. With all of the things that they’re doing, second amendment, they want to take away your second amendment or modify it to a point where it’s essentially no longer the second amendment. I would’ve thought he would’ve gone a different way. Thank you very much, everybody.
















"
"33","08-12-20","… and today, while our economy is performing significantly better than Europe, which people have to understand very strongly, it’s performing better than any market anywhere in the world, actually. At the same time, Europe has experienced a 40% higher excess mortality than the United States. And I will say that that’s a significant number. We’re working with Europe on their difficulties and we are going to help them all the way. We’re doing very well, as you know, in the vaccines and the therapeutics. But think of that. We have the strongest performing economy in the world. We’re up, I think it’s $9 trillion since March, $9 trillion in value. That’s a number that nobody’s ever heard of before. We’re also getting close to about a 50% number since March, which is incredible. So it’s $9 trillion. It’s almost 50%. In fact, I think it went above 50% today with the 300 point increase. So we’re doing much better than Europe significantly. And at the same time, Europe has experienced a 40% higher excess mortality than the United States. I just want to mention, because another number of judges were approved recently, will be probably over 300 judges, federal judges, including Court of Appeals judges approved by the end of my first term. And other than when they added new judges into somebody’s term, which happens seldom, but it’s a record nobody’s ever seen anything like this in one term. So we’re going to have over 300 federal judges and that’s Court of Appeals judges. And that’s just in the first term, probably will finish out over 300, which is pretty amazing. The stock market’s rebound signal is a V-shaped recovery, stronger than our competitors anywhere in the world. If you look, you’ll see exactly what we have. We lead the world. Japan is second, but in terms of a dollar value, it’s not even close. So there it is. A lot of great competitors; Europe, United Kingdom, Japan, China, Hong Kong. The United States is leading the world very substantially. The second slide you’ll see the virus induced economic contraction in the United States has been far less severe than it was with our peers and peer nations. And you see that right there, there’s the United States. And that’s despite the fact that we’ve done more testing than any other nation in the world, that we’ve done more by far ventilators, we’re building thousands and thousands of ventilators a month, and we’re distributing them all over the world. We’re helping other countries. But despite all of these factors, the shallowest contraction, which is a big deal, I’m sure you’d love to put them in your various media outlets. I know you want to get that out. If you want to leave the room early and do that, that will be fine. But it would be nice to report it. The rapid recovery of home builders sentiment points to massive new construction. And we are doing massive amounts of construction of new homes and that’s because people have tremendous confidence. This is where we went and the housing market has quickly rebounded. We were at a record and now we’re going to be at a record again, very shortly. Those numbers are incredible. That’s where we are. We had to turn off the economy and now we’re turning it back on, and that’s beyond the V shape. This is going to be a very strong, called a strong V. Automobile demand has increased 65% over the last three months, 65% automobile demand. And we’re anticipating that that’s going to go up even further, but that’s more than any anybody else. The manufacturing sector, remember manufacturing is dead according to the past administration of Obama and Biden. Manufacturing is dead. You’d need a magic wand. Well, you don’t need a magic wand. You need competence and capability. Manufacturing sector’s booming and the production index is at the highest reading since October of 18, which was an extraordinary period of time. And there we are. That’s pretty good. These are the numbers that nobody has seen until just recently. And now that it’s just coming out, these are numbers that are leading. I guess, stock market people, they’re very smart people. I know many of them and they’re seeing things that they don’t even believe. So the manufacturing sector is booming and the production index is at its highest reading in a long, long time. The economy generated over 9 million jobs in the last three years, a record by far and 12 million more jobs than experts predicted. So there you are. You look at that and that’s a record and it’s a record for the quarter. We had substantially more than 9 million jobs. So those are incredible about our economy and how it’s coming back. It’s coming back very strongly. It’s coming back at a level that’s far greater than anybody anticipated and we’re very proud of that. And I give a lot of credit to all of our people, Steve and Larry. And we’ll be talking about it, if you have any questions on it. It shouldn’t have any questions. I didn’t print those charts. Who did? The economy [inaudible 00:06:24]. Let’s say, I don’t know. We’ll find that out for you. It wasn’t us. We took those numbers from somebody. Where did we get those numbers, Larry? They’re from where? Okay. Everybody has that. Everybody needs. The Democrats have abandoned the American people over the simple subject of politics. Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi are holding the American people hostage over money for their radical left wing agenda that the country doesn’t want and won’t accept. For example, they’ve asked for a ridiculous $3.5 billion, that’s billion, $3.5 billion for universal mail-in voting, a system riddled by fraud and corruption. You just look at what happened with the Carolyn Maloney race. They should do that race over, by the way. I think her opponent is right when he is having fits about that race. When you look at the ballot, the ballots that are missing and the ballot frauds, nobody knows what’s going on with that race and yet they declared her a winner. So I don’t know what’s happened over the last 24 hours, but her opponent is rightfully going a little bit crazy. And then you look at what happened in Virginia, where they have 500,000 applications sent out at random to people that have no idea what happened. And they admitted they made a mistake and many were sent to dead people, at least two, three, four, were sent to dogs. One was sent to a cat. They were sent to all over the place. That was in Virginia in Patterson, New Jersey. And they had a massive amount of voter fraud and it’s been a disaster. Paterson, New Jersey, has been a total disaster, that’s universal mail-in voting. So they want $3.5 billion for universal mail-in voting for the country where you have hundreds of millions of voters. They can’t do a little race with 20,000 people. Now, they want to take it countrywide mail-in voting. It’s going to be the greatest fraud in the history of elections. When you always talk Russia, Russia, Russia, China, Iran on voting, your biggest problem is going to be with the Democrats, not with China, Russia, and Iran. Your biggest problem is going to be with the Democrats. But now the Democrats, they want $3.5 billion. Think of it. But now that they were unwilling to approve a bill that gives all of that money, of course, we would never approve an amount like that. And they also want $25 billion additional for the post office, Steve, 25 billion for the post office. So the post office can handle this vast amount of ballots that are being sent at random all over the place. They have no idea where they’re going. So they want 25 billion and think of this, they want 3.5 billion. Would you say that’s enough to cover it? I think we could do it for less, right? I think we could do it for less. But they want 25 billion for the post office because of this. And remember, the new man who is a great person, a great businessman, just got there a little while ago. The post office has been run poorly for many, many decades. Great people in the post office, incredible people, but they’ve had very bad leadership for many years. So we’ll get it straightened out. But they turned down this bill because they want radical left agenda items that nobody in their right mind would approve. So they want 25 billion for the post office, they want $3.5 billion for universal mail-in, 3.5 billion. And the bill is not going to happen because they don’t even want to talk about it because we can’t give them the kind of ridiculous things that they want that have nothing to do with the China virus. It has nothing at all to do with China virus, much of what they’re asking for. So therefore they don’t have the money to do the universal mail-in voting. So therefore, they can’t do it, I guess, right? Are they going to do it even though they don’t have the money? They’re asking for the 3.5 billion, they’re asking for 25 billion for the post office so they can do this, I guess, and other things. At 25, I would hope it would be a lot of other things too, but therefore they don’t have it. They don’t have the money to do the universal mail-in votes. It will be the greatest rigged election in history. It will be the greatest fraud ever perpetrated other than perhaps what they did to my campaign, where they spied on my campaign, president Obama, Biden and everybody else, and they got caught. Let’s see what happens. This will be one of the greatest frauds in history. So they’re admitting that they want 3.5 billion and they’re not going to do a deal that’s good for the American people. Therefore, they’re not going to get the 3.5 billion. Therefore, they can’t do the universal mail-in vote. It’s very simple. How are they going to do it if they don’t have the money to do it? The Democrats are also holding up money for schools and hospitals and small businesses and state and local governments. They tried to stop Americans from getting unemployment insurance and protection from evictions, which is why I took this decisive action. And I did executive orders, which are now in full force and effect. And going forward, I signed a directive to provide a total of $400 of additional support for Americans who are unemployed due to the China virus. That’s $400 more than the Democrats that provided. Remember that. That’s $400 more than the Democrats had provided. Nancy and Chuck haven’t provided anything. And remember this, president Obama, when we had a problem, pretty big problem, a very big problem, you know what he gave? $25. He gave 25 bucks. So now they say, well, we want to give 500 or we want to give 600. They don’t want to give. They don’t want to give anything. They’re not doing anything. But president Obama and Biden, sleepy Joe gave $25, 25. And they’ll complain, oh, we want to give more. Well, we’re giving $400 and that’s now in the works and that’ll be getting out to the people soon, Steve. Okay? Remember that. $25 is what they gave the last time, 25. I want to make it unmistakably clear that I’m protecting people from evictions. They didn’t want to do that. The Democrats didn’t want to do a protection from evictions. People getting evicted because of the coronavirus or the China virus, whatever you want to call it. Now we’re up to 21 different names. All we know is it came out of China and it shouldn’t have. They should have stopped it. Under my executive order, HUD, HHS and CDC have been directed to ensure renters and homeowners that they can stay safely in their homes. They’re not going to be evicted. They are not going to be evicted, and those letters have already been sent out, Steve, so you’ll make sure of that. I’m providing a payroll tax holiday to all Americans earning less than 100,000 per year, meaning bigger paychecks for working families through the end of 2020. That’s a tremendous amount of money that’s being supplied and given to families. Tremendous. The Democrats didn’t want to do a payroll tax. They thought it was too much money, I guess. Or it would make businesses too successful. They don’t want to see success. They certainly don’t want to see it before the election. They certainly don’t want to see the kind of graphs and charts that you saw up there because they say they can’t win. With that kind of success, they can’t win. They have to get used to it. Remember, we’ve already gotten $3 trillion in stimulus. So they should have probably negotiated a little bit differently. Maybe they should have asked for all of this before they got most of the money and we gave it out, a lot of it to the people. When we win the election, when I win the election, I’m going to go completely and totally forgive all deferred payroll taxes without in any way, shape or form hurting social security. That money is going to come from the general fund. We’re not going to touch social security. I said from day one that we’re going to protect social security and we’re going to protect our people. And social security is one of the things that will be protected. Pre-existing conditions will be protected. Medicare will be protected, but social security will be totally protected under me. Under them it will not be protected because we will have a stock market crash, the likes of which you’ve never seen. Your taxes will be doubled and tripled, and your regulations will go through the roof, which is what was causing the problems with the country in the first place. Student loans, I signed to director of providing relief to student borrowers, not their fault that they can’t go to college. I will be deferring payments on student loans at zero interest until further notice. So we’re going to take care of our students. A lot of great students out there and they got hit like everybody else. So I will be deferring payments on student loans at zero interest until further notice. And on the payroll tax, we’ll be terminating the payroll tax. After I hopefully get elected, we’ll be terminating the payroll tax. So that will mean anywhere from 5,000 to even more per family and also great for businesses and great for jobs. A lot of people will be very happy to hear that a lot of the great certainly conservative economists will be great to have. They think that’s the greatest thing we can do. That’s better than the payments. That’s better than anything else. But it’s a lot of money and it’s going right directly to the people. And it goes there very easily, but it also creates stronger companies to employ the people. So we will be … on the assumption I win, we are going to be terminating the payroll tax after the beginning of the new year. Today I met with parents, students, teachers, and health experts to discuss the vital importance of safety and safely reopening America’s schools. This evening I’ll outline the common sense recommendations that should guide schools as they re-open with precautions. We want to be very, very safe and very careful, so precautions in place. Our strategy to safely reopen schools, mirrors our approach nationwide as we race toward the competition. And the completion we’re competing with others, but I’m not competing with anyone. We just want to have a vaccine. We’re dealing with other countries and we want them to do well. We’re giving them whatever information they need. We’re all working towards something that will happen before the end of the year, maybe substantially before, but before the end of the year and therapeutics will happen, likewise, even sooner. But we’re looking for that responsible path forward to shelter those at highest risk while allowing those at lower risk to resume work and school and play football, go play football. I spoke to some of the great football players, college players, Trevor, and a lot of great players called [inaudible 00:03:23]. A lot of fantastic people. I got to speak to athletes, leaders. They want to play football, let them play, let them play. And they feel safer in the field than they do walking around and doing nothing. So hopefully that will happen. And hopefully when they play football, they will proudly stand for the national Anthem and they will proudly stand and respect the American flag or … at least I’m not watching, I can’t speak for others, but based on what I see now and based on what I’m looking at with respect to the NBA at this point, a lot of people agree with me. So we want people, we would like to request people, you stand proudly for the flag and for the national Anthem. In the month since the virus arrived, we’ve learned a great deal. Well, this is a dangerous and highly infectious disease. It primarily affects the oldest segment of our population or those with chronic health issues. The United States has the largest nursing home and assisted living home population in the Western world by far. Nearly half of all of the deaths from the China virus in the United States have occurred in nursing homes and longterm care facilities. The median age of those who succumb to the virus is 78 years old. These findings underscore that all Americans must continue to apply extreme vigilance in protecting our elderly population and those with chronic conditions. Outcomes are very different for younger Americans without serious health issues, tremendously different. They can often expect mild or moderate symptoms or even no symptoms whatsoever. They have very strong immune systems. We’ve learned even more so than we ever thought. In a typical year, approximately five times as many Americans under the age of 65, die from heart disease as have so far been lost to the Coronavirus from the same age group. That’s an interesting statistic. Plus blessedly, children appear to face the lowest risk of all. It’s 99.995% of all fatalities are adults. Think of that, 99.95. That is extremely close to 100% of all fatalities are adults. Children often have only mild symptoms and medical complications are incredibly rare, very, very, very rare. Those that do face complications often have underlying medical conditions. In each of the last five years, the flu resulted in more deaths of those under 18 in the United States than have been lost this far to Coronavirus by far. The flu does kill young people. Given these considerations, we believe many school districts can now reopen safely provided they implement mitigation measures and health protocols to protect families, to protect teachers and to protect students. All families should be empowered to make the decision that is right for their own circumstances. This is especially important if a child has underlying health conditions or lives with a parent or grandparent who is at a high risk. And one of the things we’d like to do is when we make payment to schools, because we spend a lot of money on schools, we’d like to make the payment directly to the student or to the child. And that would mean to the parents essentially, but to the child, we want to follow the child so that if a school is closed, the family can go to another school, maybe in another area, but they can do it and would like to make that payment. Rather than paying a school that’s closed, we’d rather pay directly. We’re following the child, where the child goes. And we want to pay the family, pay the child, and then the family can take care of the cost. And we’re trying to get that approved too. But the Democrats don’t like doing anything unless it means doing for the union, which controls Nancy and controls Chuck 100%. And I have nothing wrong with the union. I have great respect more than … very few people do. I respect more than a great teacher. It’s a tremendous talent, they’re really underappreciated. These are phenomenal people with tremendous talent. The great ones are among the most important people we have this country. And they’ll be great at other … they’ll be great at charter schools, they’ll be great at, when we talk about school choice, which we’d like to see so that parents can take their children to the school of their choice. That’s something we want. We think it’s very important, especially in the minority communities, they want it so badly. African American, Hispanic American, Asian American, they wanted it so badly. But the two people I mentioned, Nancy and Chuck, they’re totally controlled by the heads of the union. I think the teachers like us a lot. We’re taking care of our teachers, we want to take care of our teachers, but we cannot indefinitely stop 50 million American children from going to school and harming their mental, physical, emotional, and academic development and inflicting longterm lasting damage. I heard a gentleman today, a great person, some of you were at that meeting from Harvard say that every year is $10,000. They lose a tremendous amount of money in the future. He mentioned $10,000 and I think he was talking about on a yearly basis. They lose a lot by every year of education that they lost. Every year they gained, they gained $10,000. And when you have students sitting at home, playing with a computer, it’s not the same. That’s one thing we’ve learned for sure. It’s not the same, it can never be the same as being in a classroom. So we want to get our students in the classroom. The American Academy of Pediatrics has released guidance recommendation that schools reopen. They said, “Reopen.” It said, “Lengthy time away from school and associated interruption of supportive services often results in social isolation, making it difficult for schools to identify and address important learning deficits.” The doctors also warned about the risk of increased abuse, substance use, depression and suicide. The National Education Association recently stated, “Despite the momentous efforts of educators during the pandemic, online learning has never been an effective replacement for in- person learning and support.” So when you sit at home in a basement, looking at a computer, your brain starts to wither away. We have a lot of good experience at that just by taking a look at what’s happening in politics. Studies estimate that school closures last spring caused the average student to fall 50% behind in math and roughly 35% in reading compared to a typical year. Think of that. It caused the average student to fall 50% behind in math and 35% in reading compared to being at the school, being with your teachers, being in a classroom. We’ve learned that learning from a laptop is not great. And frankly, we’ve also learned that tele-health, a little unrelated, but it’s up 35000% and it’s been incredible. 35000%. We’ll check that number, Larry, but that’s an incredible .. but it is people staying home and the telehealth of that has been a tremendous success. We’ve learned those two things during this period of time with the plague coming in, and those are the two things we know. School closures harm, low income students the most because they have less access to high quality remote learning. They don’t have computers and less resources for academic support. All schools should be making plans to resume in person classes as soon as possible. To support the reopening of America schools, we provided $13 billion in elementary and secondary schools toward the CARES Act and CARES Act funding. We’re giving CARES Act funding, the vast majority of which remain available for States to use. So a tremendous amount of money, $13 billion, that’s the CARES Act funding. And we’re giving a large partial to that for States to use. Today I’m pleased to announce that we will provide up to 125 million reusable masks to various school districts all around the country. My administration also stands ready to deploy CDC teams to support schools that are opening and schools that need help in safety and in order to safely reopen. Finally, today, my administration is highlighting general recommendations for all schools and guidance to protect high risk teachers and students. We’re working very, very closely with many of the schools and school districts throughout the country. They include the following. To ensure all students, teachers and staff understand the symptoms of the China virus. Require all students, teachers, and staff to self-assess their health every morning before coming to school. Encourage frequent hand washing or hand sanitizing during the school day, beginning upon entrance to school and ensuring that hand washing facilities are widely available throughout the school. And for the most part, schools have been very good at that. Minimize large indoor gatherings. Hold large gatherings outdoors whenever possible. Maintain high standards of hygiene and ventilation within the classrooms, including keeping windows and doors open whenever possible and running fans and air conditioning units whenever possible. Require students, teachers, and staff to socially distance around high risk individuals and socially distance whenever possible in any event. Encourage the use of masks when social distancing is not possible. Post instructions regarding hygiene and social distancing all over the school and all around the school. We encourage schools to adopt these measures. We’ve been working with so many of them and to the best of my knowledge, virtually every one of them agrees to do that. While we’re also providing high-risk teachers and students options to engage in distance teaching or learning, we’re working on that also. College aged students also continue to be one of the lowest risk demographics. More than 99.8% of the deaths from this horrible disease, the invisible enemy we call it, occur in people over 24 years of age. Think of that, 99.8% occur in people over 24 years of age. For this reason, it could be safer for them to live at a school rather than live with their older parents or grandparents. They got to go to school. We got to open up. We got to open up our schools and open up our businesses, and a lot of it has been opened, but we can do better. As we move forward, the number of cases is not by any means the most important metric to focus on, because the fact is we have more cases because we have far more testing than any country in the world. There’s no country that’s even close. We’ve done more testing and better testing than any country. And many of these countries that the media was putting up as a shining example of success, they’re right now in massive outbreaks. You see what’s going on in many of the countries that you constantly mention. Far more important is who the virus is infecting. That’s why our strategy and attention are focused on preventing the cases that are most likely to require hospitalization or result in death. Those that afflict the elderly and those with certain underlying health conditions all the while acting to prevent hospital overcrowding. If you look at some of the states that had a flare up recently, they’re all doing very well. Florida is going down rapidly. I want to give a lot of credit to the governors. Florida is going down, and Arizona is going down, way down. They’ve done a fantastic job. California, as you know, is going down, and many other locations. It’s doing very well, and many locations are really in fantastic shape, some with very little, if any, problem. Large portions of the United States. Those advocating for a never ending blanket nationwide lockdown have no answer for what it would do to the mental, physical, and social health of millions of American children and people. This includes parents where they have to stay home with their children, because … And they lose their work and they lose their job because their children isn’t at school. They have to have somebody to take care of it and they want to take care of their child. They don’t trust people. And society must put the health and safety of our children first. A man who has the respect of everybody, he’s highly respected by me and anybody on this subject. He’s just the expert. Dr. Scott Atlas is here from Stanford and he’s been working with us for a period of time, and I thought it would be great. He was saying things to me the other day. I said, “It would be great if you could tell that to the media.” So, this is the first time I’ve shared the platform and it’s an honor to do so. Scott is truly … He’s a brilliant man. He’s a wonderful man. And he cares about the subject very much. And I’d like to ask Scott to come up please, and say a few words. Thank you, Scott. Thank you. We’re giving $400 and we are in constant touch with governors also who … They’ll be making perhaps a contribution. They have options. They can do it, or they don’t have to do it. I think most of them will do it. We’re also doing a payroll tax cut, which is a massive number. That’s a very big number and that’s a number that’s bigger than any of the numbers we talked about. And the beauty of that is that it really incentivizes companies and because it’s both a company cut and a employee cut. So that much, really, very much incentivizes people to go back to work and work hard and the company to hire people back. And we’ve had some of the great economic minds saying that’s the most important cut. That would be the best cut you could do it. We couldn’t get the Democrats to even think about agreeing to it. It’s not the Democrat way, I guess, because it just seems that whether it’s Larry Kudlow or any of your many friends, that’s the one they wanted the most. Would you say, Larry? And so, we’re doing that. And that was never even really discussed because that was taken off the table by the Democrats immediately. And this is every week. Every week you get a check or a month or biweekly. This is a major amount of money that you’re getting directly. So it’s really … It’s a very big number. It’s a very substantial number. And this is … Don’t forget this is an addition to the, to the $400, and this is a big number. And now, at the end of the year, the assumption that I win, I’m going to terminate the payroll tax, which is another thing that some of the great economists would like to see done. We’ll be paying into Social Security through the general fund. And it works out very nicely. If Biden would win, he wouldn’t do that, because he’s going to double and triple everybody’s taxes. He’s going to have to explain that one. And as you know, he’s also going to a quadruple regulations. He wants to put regulations on. One of the reasons that we had the kind of numbers and big bounces that you’ve seen. I mean, we closed it up. We saved millions of lives and now we open it and we bounce right back where we were. It looks like we’ll be bouncing right back where we were. But one of the reasons is because we cut so many horrible regulations. And Biden with his new partner, Kamala, will … If you think he’s going to put it all back but many times more. I mean, they want to increase regulations and that’s just going to drive companies out and it’s going to drive people out. It’s going to drive them to other countries and it’s going to make us not competitive with other countries. Please. They should. I think they’re afraid to. In my book, it’s virtually a part of their campaign. Antifa. The Democrats act like, “Gee, I don’t know exactly what that is.” Take a look at Portland, take a look at any place you want to take a look at. And they’re all over the place. They were here. We put on a 10 year prison sentence if you knocked down any statues two months ago. And since then, we haven’t seen much of them. We had to send border security. We sent actually Homeland and border and different forms of Homeland to Portland in order to … You know what we had to do. We had to save … They went to knock a courthouse, a $500 million courthouse. They wanted to burn it down, knock it down. And they were easily, easily able to defend, but the mayor and the governor of the state, they didn’t want to do that. And we actually sent our people there and they did a great job. They did it easily. But in the meantime, they went to other parts of the city and they’re doing damage, and we’re recommending to the governor that they call in national security, call in the national guard. We’re willing to get … We would stop that problem in one hour. We sent just defensive measures to protect and save that courthouse from being burned down or knocked down. We also saved a couple of other buildings, federal buildings, because they were unable to do the job. I have to say this. They have really good police. They have a great group of people that if they would be allowed to do their job, same with Chicago and same with New York and a couple of other cities. If they allowed … In Chicago, 25,000 police, and they’re really good, but they’re not allowed to do their job. In New York, you have New York’s finest, but they’ve totally taken away their incentive. They’ve taken away their lives in a sense because they don’t allow them to do their job. They could do that job so easily. You wouldn’t have a problem in New York. And that includes with terrorism and everything else. They disband it. They’ve cut by a $1 billion, their budget, in New York, $1 billion. And crime is up by 200%, 250% depends on what week you’re looking at. It’s crazy what’s going on in New York. We could solve that problem easily, but we don’t have to because they should be able to do it themselves, but they have to give … They have to give the honor back. It’s an honor. They have to give the honor back to their law enforcement groups. New York is great. So is Chicago. And in Portland, they could do the job. If they don’t want to do that, we would send in, gladly if they want, the national guard will take care of it in one hour. It’ll go very quickly as we did, by the way, if you take a look in Minneapolis, when they were burning down Minneapolis, a wonderful place, but nobody’s ever seen anything like it. After days, the very liberal … And these are all run by liberal Democrats. Every place I talk about is run because we have great cities and they’re run by Republicans. Okay? There’s no magic to it. It’s obvious what’s going on. And the cities that I mentioned are all run by liberal, very liberal Democrats, and it’s very sad when you see what’s happening to New York. It’s very sad when you see what’s happening to other cities, not just those three. Other cities. When you look at what’s happening, it’s not even believable. I left New York almost four years ago, and you could see signs of problems because de Blasio was there. He’s a horrific mayor, just horrific. I mean, people don’t want to go there anymore. Not only is it bad with crime, the way he talks about the city and what he does, he’s horrific. And when I see that, it’s a very sad thing. I left almost four years ago, right? And when I look and see what’s happening to a city that I love, that still has great potential, but it’s going to have to be brought back because what happened in New York is … It’s not even believable. What’s happening in Chicago where one weekend you had 78 people shot and 18 die in a weekend. And then successive weekends, you have so much of that happening. And it’s really not even believable. And if you let Democrats run this country, and we’ve stopped it from going other places. If you let Democrats run this country, you’ll have all of your cities be just like that. Well, you just saw other countries were doing much better than all other major countries, peer countries. This chart came out just a little while ago. I thought I’d … See, it’s that kind of a question, the wiseguy question, because I just went over the whole thing. We’re doing better than almost everyone with the economy. And I think we face a headwind because Democrats, perhaps for political reasons, don’t want to open up their states and that’s having a huge toll. That’s taken a huge toll on people within those states. When you look at North Carolina, you have [inaudible 00:46:07] doesn’t want to open it up. You look at Michigan, you look at some states. I mean, they just want to keep these people in their houses, in their prisons. They call them prisons. And I think a lot of it’s for political reasons, because they want to look as bad as possible on November 3rd. But I don’t think it’s going to matter because we’re doing so well in so many ways. As far as the plague is concerned, when you look at the numbers, take a look at what’s going on now with other countries. They’re having flare ups that are very, very substantial and we’ve done very well. We’re helping a lot of those countries. And those were model countries that you used to talk about and say how well they were doing, except they just exploded. They just had very big flare ups. You understand that. No, we’re doing very well. And I don’t have to show you the charts again, but those charts are at a level that nobody even thought possible. I think we’re going to have a fantastic third quarter. I think next year will be one of the strongest years we’ve had. And this is with California being closed down. This is where North Carolina and Michigan and tremendous states, great States, are being closed by … for reasons I think that Scott would tell you, you disagree with, right? You disagree with. We spent a great amount of time talking about it. We got to open up our country. We understand the disease. We understand who it hits. We have to protect our elderly people, especially our elderly people that are not well. We have to protect them, but we understand it and we understand it well. We’ve learned a lot and we’re going to have the vaccine soon, and we’re going to have the therapeutic soon. Going to come out very soon. And we’re very proud of the people, and the job they’ve done. Yeah. Please go ahead. I didn’t watch. I saw just a moment of him speaking, a moment of her speaking and it was enough. Look, he made a choice, he picked her. I watched her, I watched her poll numbers go, boom, boom, boom, down to almost nothing. And she left angry, she left mad, there was nobody more insulting to Biden than she was. She said horrible things about him, including accusations made about him by a woman where she, I guess, believed the woman. And now all of a sudden, she’s running to be vice-president saying how wonderful he is. I thought it was a very unusual pick because you said such bad things and you know better than anybody what … You won’t write it because you don’t want to do that, but you know, better than anybody, she said horrible things about him, horrible things. And she mocked him, openly mocked him. That’s why I thought that was a very risky pick, because I’m sure that’ll be played back. Not necessarily by me, but others, it’ll be played back. The other thing, if you look, she wants a $3 trillion tax hike, no fracking. How do you think no fracking in Pennsylvania is going to play? That’s a big fracking state. If you didn’t have energy produced that way, you would have taxes that would triple and you’d have unemployment that you wouldn’t believe. In Pennsylvania last year, had the best year they’ve ever had. Texas last year, had the best year they’ve ever had. Oklahoma, best year. Almost every state in our nation last year, had the best year they’ve ever had. And they’re going to have that again next year. And you can see that by what … but think of it …She wants no fossil fuels. No fossil fuels. Really? Tell that to Texas. And then I hear, “Trump is only one point up in Texas.” Now, they said the same thing with crooked Hillary Clinton. They said, “Texas is in play. Trump is down in Texas.” And then I won Texas immediately, when they said, “The polls are closed, Trump has won Texas.” And I won by a lot. And I won Georgia by a lot. It’s the same thing over, it’s almost like a duplication of what happened before, except we have much more energy now than we ever did in 2016. And we had a lot, we had record amounts in 2016. But you take a look at the tax cuts, we gave the biggest tax cut in the history of our country and the biggest regulation cuts in the history of our country, by far, right? He wants to increase everybody’s Taxes. And she’s one of the people that wants that. I mean, you take a look at that. She wants to defund or at least substantially reduce money going to police departments, and you can’t do that. You can’t do that. It’s actually got to be the opposite. I’ve been endorsed by so many police departments. I’m getting a really good one this week, that you’ll be seeing, really big, really good, but who could ever … What police department, what law enforcement group could ever support Joe Biden, where he said things that are so bad and so foolish, frankly, so stupid in terms of crime and what would happen. So, we’re getting all of law enforcement, we’re getting the military. She wants to spend much less on our military. I’ve rebuilt the military. We have the strongest military now, much of the equipment is coming in, all made in the United States. $2.5 trillion we spent. When I took over, we had a military that was totally, it was in terrible, terrible shape. It was depleted. It was a depleted military, old planes, old tanks, old everything. And we have a beautiful brand new military with the best people in the world. We’d never had anything like it. Some of the equipment is still coming in. Now, we have a … we’ve done a real job and I think we’re going to be extremely successful. I was surprised that he picked her, very surprised because of the horrible way she talked about him. And frankly, because she dropped like a rock. I didn’t, when I ran. I ran against 17 people, mostly governors and senators, some others. Ben Carson was very strong, very good, a couple of others, but mostly governors, mostly senators. And I ran and I went up, she ran and she went down to rock bottom. I don’t think she ever got to run her first … to take a vote, in the first state. And so generally speaking, you don’t want to pick somebody that went down. She went down, but she went down in a very terrible way and she said horrible things about Biden. She said far worse about Biden than I ever did. And now, she’s running as vice-president. So how does that work? Please, in the back? It’s such a fair question, such a good question. Yeah, I mean, you hear what I was saying, or Scott will be involved and he’ll be talking to you over the next couple of days, what he’s saying from great experience. No, I feel very badly for him. And I have a feeling that on November 4th, somebody is going to announce schools are open. The country’s open, everything’s open. I really believe a lot of it’s done for political reasons. If you want to know the truth. I think so. But you’re right, online is not the same as being in the classroom and that’s been proven. It’s been proven loud and clear. Yeah, any other questions? Go ahead please. What I mean is people are going to become … they’re going to be opening up areas of your neighborhood, which they’re doing and now they’re going to do … they wanted to expand it and they will expand it, if for any reason they’re going to … In my opinion, destroy suburbia. And just so you understand, 30% plus of the people living in suburbia are minorities, African-American, Asian-American, Hispanic-American, they’re minorities, 30%. The number’s even higher it’s, they say 35, but I like to cut it a little bit lower. You know why? That way I can never get myself in too much trouble with the fake news, but 30% plus are minorities living in suburbia. And when they go in and they want to change zoning, so that you have lots of problems where they want to build low-income housing. You want something where people can aspire to be there, not something where it gets hurt badly. And that’s what happens. So, with suburban women, suburban men, I think they feel very strongly about what I’m doing. I mean, it’s a very fair question, it’s a very important question, but they fought all their lives to be there. And then all of a sudden, they have something happened that changes their life and changes what they fought for for so many years. John please? So we’re looking at Gettysburg, a magnificent site, I’ve been there a number of times, it’s just a magnificent site. And we’re looking at the White House. And I would say it’s really down to those two. The White House would be a much easier from the standpoint of secret service and the movement of hundreds of people, as you know. I would say we love them both. I love Gettysburg, but this is, simpler would be magnificent. The White House is a … the White House is the White House. Gettysburg is one of the great and historic sites of our country. Frankly, as far as I’m concerned, of the world. So one of those two, I’ll probably be announcing it over the next week or so, maybe less. We're taking it out of the general fund and what we'll be doing is, if we do that, we’ll get it approved, in that case, by Congress. And we’ll take the money from other places other than we will not take it from social security, in any way, shape or form. You’re right, but we’re going to have tremendous growth. We have tremendous growth. You take a look at what’s happening here. Next year, unless somebody comes in who doesn’t know what they’re doing and they start raising taxes and forcing everybody to leave the country or leave their jobs and companies to close, we will have tremendous growth. You will see growth like you haven’t seen in a long time. Okay-Sure. I think that’s probably one of the reasons she was a terrible candidate and was forced to leave the race, because she got her facts wrong. She’s very bad on facts, she’s very weak on facts. And just so you understand, we’ve done more testing than any country in the world, by far. That includes India, which has 1.5 billion people. That includes China, that includes every country in the world, we’ve done more testing. We have better testing than any country in the world. They called, they want to know where do we get it, how do we get it. We have better testing than any country in the world. When you do as much testing as us, however, as you understand, you develop more cases. If you test it on a set of 65 million people, which is what we’ve done, when you test that many people, you’re going to find cases that normally you wouldn’t see. If you go to Mexico and you go to other countries, you’ll see they do almost no testing. They test. If somebody is not feeling well. They test if somebody is symptomatic, they test very little. They test very little. We’ve done more testing than anybody in the world. We’ve done the best job of any country in the world, and that includes from making ventilators that nobody else could have done. We are the ventilator king of the world. We’re supplying the whole world now, in a few short months, with ventilators that are very hard to produce, very expensive, very complex, very delicate, very, very important. We’ve done a great job. And then on top of that, when you look at the numbers, how we were impacted less than these other countries. And now, you look at the explosion of countries that you would have said did such a good job. And some of them had advantages over us for obvious reasons having to do the pandemic. But when you look at the job that we’ve done compared to others, we’ve done a great job. And she … I read today, that she’s very short on facts. She … I think she’s going to be a big failure. And I think, I look forward to the debate between her and Mike Pence, because I think he’ll do even better against her than he did a against Senator Kaine, which was a total wipe out. So we’ll see how it all works out. One more. Yeah please, in the back. Please. No, in the back please. I see the Democrats are sabotaging the post office because they’re not approving $25 billion that was requested. So this advertising the post office and then not allowing the post office to function properly, and they’re certainly not allowing universal mail-in votes when they do that. But equally importantly, they’re not allowing $3.5 billion in funds to do voting that they’d like to do. Therefore, all of this and all of the tremendous mistakes that were made with regard to mail-in voting, all of these tremendous mistakes, you can’t even do it. I would imagine the courts, you know this is in many courts right now. They’re showing all of the disasters that have taken place, just in the last short period of time. In the last two months with respect to universal mail-in voting. It’s just like a total catastrophe what’s happening and we can’t let that happen. Go ahead, real fast. Yeah, yeah. It’s going up by cases, if you look at cases. And the cases are going up because we do so much testing and we find it. And I call it fake media gold, because we do so much more testing than any other country. And when you do all that testing, you find cases. Go ahead, Steve, real quick. We’ve taken a lot of money from China in the last year and a half, that no other president has taken in. We’ve done things to China that nobody else has done to China, or even thought of doing it. With 25% tariffs and taking in billions and billions of dollars, tens of billions of dollars. And given then, given the farmers as an example, 12 billion one year, 16 billion another year. And made the farmers extremely happy, you don’t hear them complaining. They were targeted by China. But I’m very angry at China, because they let this horrible disease, they let this horrible plague come into our country and come into the world and they should’ve been able to stop it. They stopped it from going into China. They should’ve been able to stop it. So I’m very angry at China. Thank you very much.
















"
"34","08-13-20","Thank you very much. It was just announced by Attorney General Barr that they’ve caught the killer of LeGend Taliferro. Horribly shot young man, wonderful young man. This just came out two minutes ago. So Attorney General Barr just announced, as you know, we named Operation Legend after LeGend Taliferro where we’re going to be helping out and are in the process of helping out cities throughout our country that have difficulty with crime, in particular, certain types of crime. So that’s really good news. They caught the killer of LeGend. Today, we saw Joe Biden continue to politicize a pandemic and to show his appalling lack of respect for the American people, that’s what it is. At every turn, Biden has been wrong about the virus, ignoring the scientific evidence, and putting left wing politics before facts and evidence. Sleepy Joe opposed both the China and the Europe travel bans. You know that. He opposed the China travel ban that I instituted very early and the Europe travel ban that I instituted quite early. If I listened to his advice, hundreds of thousands more people would’ve died. This is according to many people. I believe that Dr. Fauci agreed with that. He said that President Trump made a great decision when he put the ban on China. Joe Biden wants to fling open American borders, allowing the pandemic to infiltrate every US community based on his policies. He wants to have ridiculous open borders. I’ve been saying from the first day I started campaigning for this great office that you have open borders, you don’t have a country. You don’t have a country with open borders. So he wants open borders. The Democrats want open borders. And if you take a look at our southern border, we would have criminals pouring through. The wall is getting close to 290 miles long and it’s having a huge impact. So we disagree with him on that. That’s one of the many things that we disagree with. But while Joe Biden would allow rioters and looters and criminals and millions of illegal aliens to roam free in our country, he wants the federal government to issue a sweeping new mandate to law abiding citizens. He wants the president of the United States with the mere stroke of a pen to order over 300 million American citizens to wear a mask for a minimum of three straight months. I guess it’s just happened. He thinks it’s good politics, I guess. No matter where they live and no matter their surroundings, because different states are much different, both in terms of the atmosphere itself and also in terms of the corona problem. He does not identify what authority the president has to issue such a mandate or how Federal Law Enforcement could possibly enforce it, or why we would be stepping on governors throughout our country, many of whom have done a very good job and they know what is needed. Also many of our 50 states are doing the job at a level that, frankly, people are really surprised, including foreign governments that are calling us constantly and asking for advice. So I want to just say our governors have worked very hard. They’ve worked with Vice President Pence and myself and everybody else that’s been going. We have Scott now involved. And so Scott, congratulations, where you’ll be working with a lot of governors. You’ve already started. And Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx. If the president has the unilateral power to order every single citizen to cover their face in nearly all instances, what other powers does he have? That’s why he refused, Biden, to take questions. He couldn’t answer any of them, couldn’t answer the questions. He refuses to take questions. He never takes questions. I take questions. He never takes questions. And you sort of wonder what’s going on because they’re not that difficult. Some can be nasty, but they’re not that difficult. But he never takes questions. So he just, I guess, left. I didn’t see it, but I guess he just left the podium. Put it in your minds. My administration has a different approach. We have urged Americans to wear masks and I emphasized this is a patriotic thing to do. Maybe they’re great and maybe they’re just good. Maybe they’re not so good, but frankly, what do you have to lose? You have nothing to lose. So we do. And we’ve been saying wear them when it’s appropriate, especially in terms of social distancing. If you can’t distance enough and what do you have to lose? But again, it’s up to the governors and we want to have a certain freedom and we want to have a certain freedom. That’s what we’re about. At the same time, we also understand that each state is different and is facing unique circumstances. You have very, very different states facing very unique differences and circumstances. We’ve entrusted the governors of each state, elected by the people, to develop and enforce their own mask policies and other policies following guidance from the Federal Government and CDC. We’re working with each state to implement a plan based on the facts and science. We will continue to urge Americans to wear masks when they cannot socially distance, but we do not need to bring the full weight of the Federal Government down on law-abiding Americans to accomplish this goal. Americans must have their freedoms and I trust the American people and their governors very much. I trust the American people and the governors want to do the right thing to make the smart decisions. And Joe doesn’t, Joe doesn’t, Joe doesn’t know too much. Unlike the Biden approach, our approach is guided by science. That’s why we’re focused on protecting the high risk Americans. That is why we’re delivering effective medical treatments to dramatically reduce the fatality rate. And that is why we’re developing a vaccine and therapeutics and record time. You’ll see that I think very soon. Sleepy Joe rejects the scientific approach in favor of locking all Americans in their basements for months on end, which I think is something that Scott would be very opposed to. I think I can speak for you. We’ve been dealing pretty strongly over the last number of weeks. But he wants them in the basement for months on end. And you have governors that have been very, very strict on keeping people in their houses, keeping people in their, wherever they may be, apartments. And frankly, I don’t think the results are necessarily better than other results. But he wants to shut down our economy, close our schools and grind society to a halt, and he wants it done by a Federal decree. This would lead to a crippling, long-lasting depression. This would be a crippling, long-lasting depression. And yesterday I showed you the numbers about how well we’re doing coming back with auto sales and auto manufacturing and used car sales and housing sales at numbers that nobody would have believed. And we’re back and very strong. It’s a very strong V it’s almost a straight up V. We’ll be discussing that over the next couple of days, but the economy is coming back and the employment numbers over the last three months are a record in history of our country. And we’ll be back next year. I think we’ll be maybe even stronger than the previous year where we set every record in the book on employment and stock market. By the way, our stock market numbers are very close to record and NASDAQ is actually record over the last 14 days. For 14 times now it’s been record and that’s during what we hope will be the more final stages of the pandemic. So if we did what Biden wanted to do, it would shut down our health care system and lead to a massive increase in mortality, including suicide, overdose, heart disease, and countless other physical and mental harms. It is very, very bad on the other side of the equation when you do something like that. Those shutdowns are very punitive, very punitive. They hurt a lot of people in a lot of different ways through depression, through suicide, through so many other things, alcohol, drugs. Biden’s approach is regressive. It’s anti-scientific and it’s very defeatist, but it’d be very bad for our country. While Joe Biden has been playing politics from the sidelines, he has no clue. We’ve been solving problems and delivering tremendous results. The most advanced and robust testing system on the planet. The number one producer of ventilators in the world by far. Unprecedented, industrial mobilization, biggest since World War II. Operation Warp Speed to deliver life saving treatments and very soon a vaccine. What a plan by Joe Biden has actually laid out would do, we’ve really already accomplished. In fact, many of the things that was well reported over the last few days, every single thing he said to do, every single thing we did and we did them well. So Biden has no idea on his own. He only knows what he thinks we should do and he spews it out. And then he, I guess you could say he plagiarizes and he really did in our case because every single one of the events… I think Haley, we can say that was something we had already done. So we’ll defeat the virus, but not by hiding in our basements. He’s got to come out of his basement. We’ll defeat this virus through a common sense mitigation effort, shielding those at highest risk and unleashing America’s medical and scientific genius, which is what it is. And we’ve already been doing it and we’re very close to having something that’s going to be very, very special in the form of therapeutics and vaccines. To Joe, I would say stop playing politics with the virus, too serious. Partisan politics has no place here. It’s a shameful situation for anybody to try and score political points while we’re working to save lives and defeat the pandemic. In times of national challenge, America is and Americans and we are, by the way, we are working with countries from all over the world. And they’re trying to learn from us. And some of the countries that you spoke most well about are having a tremendous surge right now, but it’ll work out. But Americans must unite together and they must put politics aside and have to really unite for a common good. Three vaccines are in the final stage of clinical trials. They’re doing really well. We’re producing the most promising vaccine candidates in advance, as you know, part of the largest industrialization ever. It’s incredible when I meet with heads of companies that are doing this, that are the best companies anywhere in the world. It’s incredible where they are, how they’re doing and the speed with which they’re doing it and also the speed with which the FDA is approving things because by any other standard, you would have been two or three years away from being at the point that we’re at. By the end of this week, we will have shipped 1,846 rapid point of care testing devices to nursing homes, which are very important sources for people that are not handling the plague from China very well. This week alone, we’re sending 992 testing devices and 450,000 tests to more than 950 nursing homes across the country. And these tests are incredible. These are tests that are all new, very modern. And we’re also getting, on the tests that are not done immediately with the five to 15 minute timing, when they do send them to a lab, they’re coming back now in three days. So it’s a three day process, which is about as good as you can do. You have one day of delivering, one day of receiving and one day in the lab. We’re also requiring all nursing homes to test all members of their staff at least weekly. By unleashing America’s scientific genius, we have delivered effective treatments. The case fatality rate for Americans over 70 has declined by about 85%. That’s a fantastic number. It’s declined, that’s case fatality. It’s declined by 85%. Europe has seen 40% more excess mortality than the United States compared to a non-pandemic year. So you hear the numbers and those numbers are very interesting, but that’s the way it is. We continue to urge all Americans to wash your hands, socially distance, wear a mask when necessary and when you can not distance and protect, very importantly, the vulnerable, protect people that are older and especially people that have problems with heart or diabetes or some other problem. Earlier today, very exciting news, very big news, all over the world that talking about it, all over the world, it was amazing. We finalized a historic peace agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates. After half a century, Israel and the United Arab Emirates will fully normalize their diplomatic relations. Nobody thought this was something that could happen for a long time. This is the most important diplomatic breakthrough since the Egypt-Israel Peace Agreement was signed over 40 years ago. We have Ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, here. Thank you David, for being here, we very much, you would agree that this was a big day for Israel and a big day for the world. Good. Thank you, David. You’ve been fantastic, too. Fantastic ambassador and representative of our country. Thank you very much. The deal that was reached today will enable Muslims to have far greater ability to visit many historic sites in Israel and to peacefully pray at the Al-Aqsa Mosque, which is very important to them, which they’ve wanted to have access to for many, many decades. This is a monumental step to forging ties of cooperation in the Middle East. And I think you’re going to have other countries come forward. I can tell you, we already do, and they want to make a deal. You could have peace in the Middle East. It’d be fantastic. Israel is also suspending settlements in the West Bank, which is a big deal, a bold step toward achieving peace. Israel and the United Arab Emirates have also agreed to immediately expand and accelerate scientific collaboration to develop effective treatments and vaccines to defeat the China virus. They both have been hit. Virtually every country has been hit, 188 countries, and to save lives in their region and in their world. So they are working very much on the vaccines also with us. And again, some very good news is going to take place with respect to that. Our unprecedented diplomatic engagements laid the groundwork for this historic peace agreement, which was just announced a little while ago today. We will not rest as we continue to work toward a world of greater harmony and prosperity for all. I want to thank Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Crown Prince Mohammad bin Zayed of the United Arab Emirates, two fantastic people, for their vision and their leadership. And I look forward to hosting them at the White House very soon to formally sign the agreement. We’ll probably be doing it over the next, I would say three weeks and they’ll be coming to Washington. So that was a tremendous day. That was a tremendous thing that happened and it’s a great sign. We have a lot of other interesting things going on with other nations also having to do with peace agreements and a lot of big news is coming over the next few weeks, and I’m sure you’ll be very impressed and more importantly it’s a great thing for our country, a great thing for the world. So thank you very much. Please go ahead. Well, you know we don’t want the schools shut down, we want the schools to open, and especially very young children, all children, all children, but especially very young children, handle it very well. So we want schools open. We don’t want to be in that position. We want schools open. We’ve made payment, and we would frankly, if the school isn’t going to open, we would much rather follow the child with the payment. Give the money to the child, meaning the parents of the child, and let the parents do what they have to do including bringing the child to another school. Because we’re finding that whether it’s parents or children, people want to get back to school. They want to have their life back. Some people say, they don’t want, the Democrats, don’t want schools open because that’s where you have a lot of polling booths and if you have a school closed you can’t very easily have polling booths at the school. And that’s becoming, I think, maybe we’ll be able to show that as fact, but that’s another thing that they’re doing to try and keep people away from the polls. So we have to look into that. But you’ve been reading about it, I’ve been reading about it, and I don’t like it. But we’d like to see the schools open then we don’t have that problem. Good question. Thank you, please. What do you think? Tell me. But they are supported largely by some of the countries that we’re talking to and that have already signed, in the case of the one country, but others will be following. And I think the Palestinians will, without saying it necessarily yet, I think they very much want to be a part of what we’re doing. And I see ultimately the Palestinians, I see peace between Israel and the Palestinians. I see that happening. I think as these very big, powerful, wealthy countries come in, I think the Palestinians will follow quite naturally. Yeah, please. Say it again. Could you make it louder? What do you think about that, David? It's interesting. Please, Kaitlan. No, not at all. No. Sure. If they’re a separate thing I would do it. But one of the reasons the Post Office needs that much money is to have all of these millions of ballots coming in from nowhere and nobody knows from where and where they’re going. You saw what happened, Kaitlan in Virginia. It was 500,000 applications coming in going all over the state, nobody even knows where they came from. You saw what happened in New York, which was a disaster with Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney. It was a basic disaster. And you see Patterson, New Jersey, what’s going on there, and we can give you many other locations and sites. What has happened is that’s part of a big negotiation. That’s actually a small part of a big negotiation to get more money to people that it wasn’t their fault. It was China’s fault, and Post Office is part of it. Another part of it is they want three and a half billion dollars just for the ballots themselves. Why it’s so much, I don’t know, but that’s what the Democrats want. But if the bill isn’t going to get done, that would mean the Post Office isn’t going to get funded, and that would also mean that the three and a half billion dollars isn’t going to be taken care of. So I don’t know how you could possibly use these ballots, these mail-in ballots. Absentee ballots by the way are fine. But the universal mail-ins that are just sent all over the place where people can grab them and grab stacks of them and sign them and do whatever you want, that’s the thing we’re against. I can understand the Post Office, and if we could agree to a bill, the overall bill, which is obviously a much bigger number than just the Post Office, that would be fine. But they have the Post Office as one of their requests. It’s their requests. I’m only against, what I’m against is, I’m against doing anything where the people aren’t taken care of and the people aren’t being taken care of properly. We want people to get money. It wasn’t their fault that they got shut down. They got shut down by China. So whether it’s the Post Office or whether it’s a three and a half billion dollars, they’re asking for three and a half billion dollars just for the universal mail-in ballots. But they’re not willing to make a deal. These are two points within a very big deal. The thing they want more than anything else, Kaitlan, And you know this, is bailout money for the states and for the cities that are in trouble, which for the most part are Democrat run states and cities. So New York has a problem, California has a problem, Illinois has a tremendous problem, and others. They want to be able to bail out these states and we don’t want to be doing that or certainly don’t want to do it to the extent. They’re looking for $1 trillion. We don’t want to be doing that. Please go ahead. No, no, no. I said it will end up being fraudulent because if you look at what’s happened over the last few weeks, just look at the few instances where this has happened, it’s turned out to be fraud. Well, if you look at New York, it was fraudulent. If you look at Patterson, New Jersey, it was fraudulent. Of course there is. The whole thing is a mess. In fact, Carolyn Maloney’s opponent, he’s gone crazed. He said they took the election away from him, and he may be right. I think they should redo that election. And if you look at Virginia, it’s terrible. Look at some of the things that have happened in California. Look at California, where they found a million non-eligible voters. That was done by Judicial Watch, Tom Fitton and Judicial Watch. We have to have an honest selection, and if it’s not going to be an honest election, I guess people have to sit down and think really long and hard about it. But if they’re not going to approve a bill and the Post Office therefore won’t have the money, and if they’re not going to approve a big bill, a bigger bill, and they’re not going to have the three and a half billion dollars for the universal mail-in votes, how can you have those votes? What it would mean is the people will have to go to the polls and vote like the old days, like two years ago, three years ago, four years ago. They have to go. It doesn’t say anybody’s taking their vote away, but it means that the universal mail-ins don’t work. Absentees do work. It’s a very different thing. An absentee where you make an application and you send it in. They send you a vote. It’s different. So, Kaitlan, I’m not saying anything wrong with voting, I want them to vote, but that would mean that they’d have to go to a voting booth like they used to and vote. Well, they’re going to have to feel safe and they will be safe and we will make sure that they’re safe and we’re not going to have to spend three and a half billion dollars to do it. And when you go to a voting, it would be wonderful if we had voting ID and some states have that and some states don’t because they can’t get it passed. Most states want it. But we want people to vote, but we want people to vote so when they vote it means one vote. It doesn’t mean ballots all over the place. You saw what was happening in Virginia where piles of ballot applications are dropped all over the state. They had them named after dogs. They had them named after dead people. We want to have an accurate vote. I’m not doing this for any reason. Maybe the other turns out to be my advantage. I don’t know. I can’t tell you that. But I do know this, I just want an accurate vote. And it’s a fair question, by the way. So does everybody else. Yeah, in the back. Help what? Well, I think it’s going to. I think it’s a big start, and you’re right about that. Christians have been persecuted by some countries in particular in the Middle East and I think this is a big start. It’s going to be a very strong start, very powerful start, and it’s something that I will tell you. I’ve told David and I’ve told every one of our negotiators, if you look at the way Christians have been treated in some countries, it’s beyond disgraceful. If I had information and if I had absolute proof, some of the stories that we’ve heard, which are not easy, which is not easy to get, I would go in and do a number to those countries like you wouldn’t believe, what they do to Christians in the Middle East. And it’s disgraceful. It’s disgraceful, you’re right. It’s a very big part of the overall negotiation. And as countries come in, for instance, UAE has agreed very strongly to represent us. I think they will very well with respect to Christianity. Because in the Middle East, it’s not treated well. It’s not treated well at all. It was treated horribly and very unfairly and it’s criminal what’s happened, and that’s for many, many years. I think it’s a great question and it’s a very unfair situation. Please, go ahead. We have a deadline of September 15th, and whether it’s Microsoft, I understand, and others are negotiating. We also said that obviously it’s worthless if we don’t allow them into the country. So we said that the United States Treasury is going to be getting something out of this deal, something very substantial. But what we want is total security. But we have a deadline of September 15th. So I know Microsoft and others are very interested in it, but that’s our deadline. And it has to be proven to be totally secure. We don’t want to have any information going into China with what we’ve been through. And I have to tell you, you talked about the deal, you mentioned the phase one deal, well, the phase one deal, it’s a very interesting situation because you’ve been hearing the largest order of corn in history, the largest order of soy beans, the largest order of beef, they’ve done more than they’ve ever done so you’re going to have to figure that one out. With where I’m coming from, because they see my attitude, my attitude toward China is not friendly, but they have gone into orders that are extremely large, extremely large. And our farmers are very happy. But with what they did with respect to the pandemic, the plague that came in from China, it just is a different feeling. It was an incredible deal, but I have a very different feeling. But they are giving the Midwest, our farmers, among the largest orders they’ve ever seen. Somebody told me today, Bob Lighthizer said that it’s about 40% of what they’re selling now is going to China. So maybe they’re trying to make me change my mind a little bit because you know my attitude on China and it hasn’t been very good. Well, we’re not talking to them. No, we’re talking to the companies. There is a company but it’s a company within China, that means China, and the deal will have to be substantially beneficial to the United States and we need total security. Go ahead, please. No, not off the table. No. It’s something they’ve discussed, but Israel has agreed not to do that. I mean, more than just off the table, they’ve agreed not to do it. And I think that was very important and I think it was a great concession by Israel and I think it was a very smart concession by Israel. But, David, do you have anything further to add on that? No, right now all I can say, it’s off the table. So I can’t talk about sometime into the future. That’s a big statement. But right now it’s off the table. Is that a correct statement, Mr. Ambassador? Go ahead. That's right. No, not at all. No, I wouldn’t do that at all. No. I want the post office to run properly, which makes sense. They would need a lot more money if they’re going to be taking in tens of millions of ballots that just come out of the sky from nowhere. And so they need additional financial help. It’s a part of the bill that the Democrats don’t want to make because they want a much bigger part of the bill, they want a trillion dollars to go to states that are run by governors who happen to be Democrats who have not done a good job for many, many years. And those are states that owe a lot of money, and need a lot of money. They’re talking about $1 trillion. So the post office and the $3.5 billions for the votes themselves. Which sounds like a lot of money they’re looking for. $3.5 billion. Think of that; $3.5 billion to have mail in ballots. Again, absentee good. Universal mail-in, very bad. Please, go. Well, they can do it very easily. All they have to do is make a deal. If they make a deal, the postal service is taken care of, the money they need for the mail in ballots would be taken care of, if we agreed to it. That doesn’t mean we’re going to agree to it. But all they have to do is make a deal. But again, more important to them is not that. That’s a lot of money, but its small time compared to the other. What they want to do, and very, very strongly what they want to do, is bail out cities that are run by Democrats and have been for many years. And these cities and states have done very badly, and they desperately need money for that. And we’re open to something, but we’re not open to the kind of money that they need. Go ahead, please. Just one second, please. Just one second, please. Go ahead. That there what? So everyone talks about Russia, Russia, Russia. They talk about China, China. They talk about all of these different countries that come in and run our elections, which is false. But what they don’t talk about are things like very loose mail-in ballots, universal in nature, that frankly, Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, all of these countries that we are reading about, hearing about, and in some cases they’re writing about intelligence wise. These countries can grab those ballots or print forgeries of those ballots, and they would go out and they would have a field day. This is the easiest way for… The mail-in ballots is the easiest way for a country like China, or a Russia, or a North Korea, or Iran… I hear Iran, too. That was part of the report. This would be very easy for them. This is much easier than… Well we have been very strong. Now, if you remember, president Obama was informed about Russia by the FBI in September, the election was in November. President Obama decided to do absolutely nothing about it. People don’t mention that very much anymore. That’s a lost fact. But he was informed very powerfully that they’re going to do, and president Obama did nothing. We have done a lot and we’ve really shored it up. But what people can never prepare for are millions and millions of mail-in ballots because they can be forged. They can be captured. They can be taken. Well, that’s a very hard thing to do. We have to make sure that we can do that. Please. All the what? That who has done? Yeah, go ahead, please. Please. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. The payroll tax is very important and a very big benefit to people as you know. To companies, because we want the companies to be strong, but now directly to people. And it’s a very big number, and we’re taking care of it. And this will go directly to the people, the workers, within the company. It’s a payroll tax. It’s called a payroll tax cut. We’re cutting the payroll tax, and it’s a very large number. And that will go directly to the workers of the company. You mean later on? You mean later on at a later date? The employers will collect it and give it, most likely. The employers will collect it and give it. Okay? Please. Go ahead. Can't understand a word you're saying. I heard it today that she doesn’t meet the requirements. And by the way, the lawyer that wrote that piece is a very highly qualified, very talented lawyer. I have no idea if that’s right. I would have assumed the Democrats would have checked that out before she gets chosen to run for Vice President. But that’s a very serious… You’re you’re saying that they’re saying that she doesn’t qualify because she wasn’t born in this country. Yeah. I don’t know about it. I just heard about it. I’ll take a look. Back in the back, please. Yeah. I’m thinking about going directly to the UN to do the speech. A lot of people will not because of COVID, will not be able to be there, as you’d know. But I think it’s appropriate. If we can do it, I’ll do it directly. And again, this will not be like in the past because some countries won’t be able to escape the problems they’re having. Countries that are having a tremendous problem with the China virus. So we’ll see what happens, but I would prefer doing it. I can do it the other way. I can do it viral as they say, I can do it in that form, but I’d rather be at the United Nations, deliver it. I think it better represents the country. Also, I feel sort of at least a semi obligation as the President of the United States to be at the United Nations to deliver what will be an important speech. Well, the room won’t be empty. The room will have different people there and representatives of countries, but I can understand how it’s very difficult for countries to be there. They won’t be there only for that reason. They’d love to be there. I’ve already had people call. In fact, say a couple of them, “I’d love to be there. If you want, I’ll be there.” I said, “Don’t be there. You don’t have to be there.” No, the room would be a… I think the room will not be. Although there may be a spacing requirement like you have in this room. This room was always packed. This room would be packed again if we had the seats open, but you have a spacing requirement. So I understand that the United nations, they may have that too. Yes, please. Sure. Yes, please. Please. Thank. Well, I think it’s a terrible thing, but one thing that we have done, we gave tremendous incentives to Hong Kong; because of freedom. We want freedom. And we were giving tremendous economic incentives to Hong Kong. And we have now withdrawn all of those incentives. And it will be impossible for Hong Kong to compete with the United States, with respect to that, it just won’t be. Because we’ve taken all of the incentives away. If you look at China with the World Trade Organization, as an example, they’re getting tremendous because they’re considered a developing nation, which is ridiculous. Why should they be a developing nation? But we’re not. And they get tremendous incentives. We have, by the way, told them it’s unacceptable. And we’ve been doing that for a long time. They understand exactly how we feel, and big changes are being made. But with respect to Hong Kong, they get tremendous financial incentives so that they could do business and compete in the world. We’ve now withdrawn all of those incentives. It’s going to be very hard for Hong Kong to compete. And I will tell you that the United States, and I say this from any standpoint you want to hear it, will end up making a lot more money because of it. Because we lost a lot of business to Hong Kong. We made it very convenient for people to go there, for companies to go there. We’ve withdrawn all of that. And the United States will be a big beneficiary from an economic standpoint, but I hate to see what happened to Hong Kong because freedom is a great thing. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you very much.
















"
"35","08-14-20","Thank you very much. What a nice group of people. They’re not treating you right, but we’re going to treat you right. They’re not. They’re not treating you right, but we’re going to change that around quickly. Pat, I’ve been a fan of yours for a long time. I’ve known you for a long time. You do one hell of a job, and you’re pretty popular with these people I see. [crosstalk 00:00:28]. Thank you, Pat. Well, maybe I’ll say a few words. It’s appropriate in light of everything that’s going on. When you look at all of the statistics, all of the numbers, New York’s finest, I love, and you’re the finest, they just don’t let you do the job [crosstalk 00:00:44]. They won’t let you do your job, that’s all it is. So it’s my great honor to proudly accept something that Pat’s going to give me in a little while, so I’ll hold off on the word endorsement, but he’s going to give me an endorsement, I understand. And I have deeply and profoundly admired the brave men and women, as you know, of New York City’s finest, and I’ve admired you my whole life. My whole life I’ve watched you do a job like nobody else. Nobody else has done it. And truly, you’re the best of the best and I’m grateful. And I’m very happy that you’re here, and we’ll have a little fun for a little while, but first we’re going to talk a little business. We have to talk business because we have to straighten out our city. Our city’s a mess. Every day, the courageous offices of NYPD put your lives on the line to protect the innocent and to put violent criminals behind bars. You protect people you’ve never met before. You know, I’ve heard that expression a long time ago, and it always means something to me. You’re protecting people with your lives, people that you’ve never met before, and you’ve done an incredible job. And the world will never forget the New York police offices who ran into the smoke and flames of 9/11, I was there, many never to return. We salute the heroes of NYPD and we salute our law enforcement heroes all across the nation. I was responsible, along with a couple of people that were right in this audience, for getting you some very good and large payments so that we can take care of some of the people that were hurt so badly. Longterm hurt they call it, right? Longterm hurt, but we got it done and we got it signed. We got it signed and we’re taking of a lot of people. And we want to thank our great firefighters also, right alongside of you, right? Our great firefighters. As we gather today, our country is suffering from a radical far left movement. It’s not even to be believed when you see this, what they’re thinking. Where did these people come from? Where do they come from? That is trying to defame, demoralize, defund, dismantle, and dissolve our great police departments. It’s a left wing war on cops. If Sleepy Joe Biden were to become precedent, he would immediately pass legislation to gut every single police department in America. You know that. And probably, she’s a step worse. She’s a step worse, Kamala. I was sort of hoping he was going to pick Pocahontas, but that [ inaudible 00:03:32]. She of Indian heritage number. Remember I said I have more Indian than her, I have more Indian than she does? And I went into it. I went into it at great length and I turned out to be right. I have none and I had more than she had. She’s another beauty. Portland and Chicago are the left’s roadmap to America, and sadly, what’s happened over the last year in New York City. And it’s an incredible thing to look at, an incredible, incredible thing. And I just saw somebody here named Rudy Giuliani. Do you know Rudy Giuliani? Where’s Rudy? Is he around here? Get up here, Rudy. Get up. What are you doing down there, Mr. Mayor? This the greatest Mayor our city has ever had. Rudy, come on up here. Come on up. What a great… And he’s a man who is loyal and dedicated and tough. He got on television to defend me. He said things that even I wouldn’t say. He was brutal. He is incredible. He knew. He got it. Joe Biden’s national police strategy will be modeled on the Bill DeBlasio, catastrophe. It’s a catastrophe. No one will be safe in Biden’s American, no city, no town, no suburb will be spared. And you see how I did something to help the suburbs of our country last week? A lot of people don’t want to even talk about it, but we did something that nobody else would have done. They’re ruining your suburbs. They want to ruin it. They want to destroy their housing values and your safety. But we ended it. We ended the program entirely. Somebody said, “Let’s amend it.” I said, “No, let’s end it.” The Biden-Harris agenda, and I guess Harris could be bigger than you think in terms of the importances of vice president. They said there’s never been a more important pick, but in the end it’s not going to matter because we’re going to win. [crosstalk 00:05:34]. You know, honestly, we don’t have a choice. We have to win. This country will go to hell. The stock markets will crash. Your 401ks are going to be worthless. You’ll see. You’ll see what would happen, crime all over the place. I mean, you take a look at Portland. You take a look at Chicago, and I can name plenty of other cities, but I don’t want to embarrass anybody. My agenda is anti-crime and pro-cop all the way and that’s what it’s got to be. So in recent months, New York City has witnessed the horrors that result from putting extreme left politicians into power. DeBlasio has launched a crusade against, and he really has, he has launched a real crusade against the police like I don’t think anybody’s ever really seen, but there are cases that are just as bad. There are some cases, radical left, that may be even are worse. The mobs have scrawled disgusting slogans such as cops must die. Think of this, cops must die and kill all cops. Okay? Who would even have thought 10 years ago that was possible? On the side of buildings, they put those terms. And they vandalized St. Patrick’s Cathedral, the beautiful St. Patrick’s Cathedral, with horrible, horrible statements, horrible phrases. And then of course that disgusting chant, “Pigs in a blanket, fry them like bacon,” right? Remember that? And now, all of a sudden, it becomes mainstream. It becomes, “Oh, isn’t this wonderful?” They were talking about you. You know that, right? We just can’t forget it because we have to bring law and order back to our cities, back to our country, and we’re doing it. Wherever we go, we do it. But when you have the radical left running it, no good. Rioters have rampaged through Manhattan and looted Fifth Avenue and an NYPD Sargent was left, as you know very well, in critical condition after being rundown with a car. A Molotov cocktail was thrown into a police vehicle in Brooklyn. And NYPD’s highest ranking uniform chief and other offices were beaten in broad daylight on the Brooklyn Bridge. And they’re not allowed to fight back. You’re not allowed to fight back. You fight back, you lose your pension, you lose your life. They put you in jail you fight back. No, you got to be able to fight back. I mean, to me, one of the saddest, and I don’t want to embarrass anybody, but one of the saddest things, Rudy, that I’ve ever seen, Pat, was when they were dumping water on the heads of two of your fellow officers. And I wish they fought back. I promise nothing would have happened to them. Because who even knew that was water? It could have been plenty of other things. It probably was actually. But it could have been some very dangerous material, not water. And they didn’t fight back. The first time I’ve ever seen that. I wish they did. I wish they did. I wish I could have talked to them. I said, “Fight back. I swear you’ll be protected.” This is the left’s vision for the future of the United States of America. If they win this election, November 3rd, got to get out, got to get everybody you know. You know, the Democrats have an advantage because they have certain people that automatically vote. And we’re going from New York. We’re going for New York [crosstalk 00:09:02]. Because we did well last time. You know, New York is not supposed to be Republican territory. It was Ronald Reagan. But a lot of the people left. A lot of the people that voted for Ronald Reagan left. That was the last time. And they voted for Ronald Reagan, but they left. They went on to other places. They got tired of being abused and high taxes and all of the other problems. And we’re going to go and run and we’re going to run on law and order, and we’re going to run our lower taxes, and we’re going to run on doing something with salt. You know what the salt is? Remember Schumer? Schumer said, “I try and bring home things to my people in New York.” You know what he brought home? Salt. For those of you that don’t know, look it up. It’s not good. But if they win this election, every city in America will be under siege. You know that. Because the police are good in Seattle and they’re good in all of these different places I talked about. They’re not being let do their job. Can’t do their job. Their pro-crime agenda, the Biden-Harris group will also crush our economy because there is no prosperity in cities that are ruled by fear. And I even think the politicians are afraid. If you look at Portland, the Mayor is trying to say, “Oh, these are my friends.” And then he goes in there, they want to beat the hell out of him. And then the fake news doesn’t report that. They’ll show him standing there with the sound down so you don’t hear what they’re saying to the Mayor. Fortunately, he had five body guards when he went in, right? But it was very dangerous for him. And I don’t know if he’s doing this at a stupidity or out of fear. Because I think they’re afraid actually. Yeah. It sounds like one of my friends. My administration has made clear that the Department of Justice will partner arm-in-arm with our police heroes. And we’re with you all the way and we’ll prosecute all federal violations to the fullest extent of the law. But you know, we have to be invited in, unless we do something very drastic, which is a big statement, but we have to be invited in. But you don’t need help. You guys don’t need help. You have the greatest police force in the world. You have the greatest in the world. All they have to do is tell your top people to do your job and you’re going to do it properly. You’re not going to do something in excess to what [inaudible 00:11:26], but they want to tell you to do your job and you’re not going to have any crime in New York. It’s going to go down like it did with Rudy Giuliani. It’s going to go down so fast. That happened quickly, Rudy. That didn't take too long. That didn’t take too long. You, he looks good enough. Let’s draft Rudy. You better be careful, he’d win it. He’d win very easily. Because people want that back. They want it back. That’s why I think, I really am, I’m putting it into play. Most people would say, “Oh, spend your time in other places,” but I’m going to put it. We did very well. We did incredibly upstate, Long Island, all of the various, Staten Island was great, right? Staten Island was great. By the way, Joe Rose is a disaster. I will tell you that. I hope they get him out of there. He’s a total lightweight in many ways. Joe Rose, get him out. He turns out he’s another beauty. My administration will so increase funding for police so that we can hire more police offices nationwide. We’re increasing funding very substantially. And in many cases, they don’t want it. They want to put into a different group. I said, “What’s that group all about?” And it’s called socialism, and it doesn’t work. Never will work. By contrast, New York City voted to defund the police by $1 billion, if you can believe it, even after experiencing the bloodiest June in nearly 25 years. It’s dismantled an elite team of crime fighters, that crime fighting unit that your friends, there were incredible people. They were making us all safe. Nationwide, they were making us safe and we got to get them back. We got to bring them back. Hopefully, they don’t get a job for too much money. Tell them not to look too hard because we’re going to bring them back. We’ll get them back. They’re the best. [Rudy 00:13:17] started that. They’re the best. Joe Biden and Kamala, they always say Kamala, Kamala, Harris have a plan to spread this mayhem to every community in America. Now, in all fairness to Joe, he doesn’t really know what’s happening. They say, “Joe, we’re going to spread it around. Oh, okay. Okay.” This guy doesn’t answer any questions. He gets up today. He made a statement. I just did an incredible deal with UAE. You saw that, right? Everyone’s shocked. Even the New York Times said it was incredible deal. Can you believe? The New York Times? I can’t even believe it. Thomas Friedman, they wrote an incredible editorial. It was a great deal. So we did this deal. Nobody else did it. In fact, we were at a huge deficit because of the horrible deal that Obama made with Iran. Gave them $150 billion, billion, not million. 150 million’s a lot. That would be too much also. 150 billion then gave them 1.8 billion in cash. I broke the deal. I terminated the deal, but we made a deal, UAE and Israel. And sleepy Joe got up and said he made the deal. I said, “Whoa.” Did anybody hear that? He actually took credit for making that deal. For a change, I’m being praised all over the world for making that deal, and that’s just the beginning. I think they just said, “Say this Joe. Say that you made it.” It’s like it was Obama’s economy right? Before the plague, we had the greatest economy in history. Greatest economy anywhere in the world, let alone ours. And now we’re building it back up very rapidly. You see the numbers. But they were taking credit. They said, “Oh, this was Obama. Obama.” He said manufacturing would never come back. That was Obama. Manufacturing has come back big. In fact, even two days ago, they announced incredible numbers. When asked recently if he favors cutting police budget, Biden replied. “Yes, absolutely.” But I’m not sure honestly he knew what he was replying to so we’re not … “Yes, absolutely. What did I say? What was I referring to?” You could use that clip for a million different things right? Yes, absolutely. You never say that as a politician. You always finish out. Biden has been described by police as and he described the police, you saw that, as the enemy. He said it’s the enemy. Kamala Harris applauded LA’s recent decision to slash its police budget, and LA really went to town on it, you saw that. Millions and millions of dollars off their budget. After the riots in Minneapolis, Kamala encouraged Americans to donate money to the so-called Minnesota Freedom Fund, which bailed out rapists, assaulters and murderers. They bailed them right out of jail. Biden’s staff donated to the same fund. We can’t lose this election. Okay? We can't lose. We’re building a big wall. We’re building the wall. It’s up to almost … Look at her. She’s all excited about that. That’s-Yeah, we’re building. It’s up to 280 miles. Will be up … That’ll be completed-You’re right. I like her. No, you’re right. And you know who like the wall? The Southern border, you know who like at the most? Hispanics, because they know the area. They know what comes in and they want to be safe. They want to keep their good jobs. They want to keep their beautiful houses. They’ve done well, but they know the area the best. We’re doing great with the Hispanics. As San Francisco district attorney, she chose not to seek the death penalty against a gang member who killed a San Francisco police officer going against the wishes of the officer’s wife, going against the wishes of the police. In his unity manifesto written with socialist … Bernie Sanders is another beauty, Bernie. Crazy Bernie. We’ve got names for all of them no? What’s better? Sleepy Joe or slow Joe? Tell me. What is better? I go back and forth. I go back and-Okay, let's do it. Who likes Slow Joe? Who likes Sleepy Joe? That’s what I thought. I got all these guys telling me, “Oh, you ought to do. We don’t like sleepy because it’s rude.” They said it’s rude. I said, “We’re talking about the president of the United States.” I can tell you one thing. Putin and Kim Jong Un and President Xi of China, they’re not sleepy. We’re never going to say sleepy or slow, and we can’t have slow, sleepy people dealing with them either because we were doing very well against all of them. All of them. And we’re have a good relationship now. Remember North Korea? We were going to go to war with North Korea. Obama would have been in a war. Millions of people could have been killed in that war. Where’s the war? Everybody said, “Trump will be in war in the first week.” Where’s the war? In fact, we’re bringing people out of the endless Wars. The Wars that where their doing your job. They’re policemen and that’s great, but they want to fight. They want to win. We didn’t let people win. Bring them back. We shouldn’t have been there in the first place. So we bring them back, and what we’re doing is bringing them back with great dignity. It’s incredible what’s happened. We’ve totally rebuilt our armed forces, $2.5 trillion. We’ve given you hundreds of millions of dollars worth of equipment. Pat, you know that. Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of equipment came out of … It was collecting dust, right? It was army surplus stuff and all the different … It was beautiful stuff and Obama didn’t want you to have it. They said it made you look too strong, too tough. You look too military. So they said, “Let them get shot.” Much of it was protective equipment. You know that. I released it all. I gave it to all the police departments all across the country and I have had more thank yous for that. And someday, they’re going to have to explain why they didn’t want to do it. And this was sitting there. It was not going to be used. A lot of it was new, but it wasn’t going to be used. And I said, “Give it to our great police all over the country.” And we did and it’s been great. And just to finish up, I call it the manifesto because Bernie Sanders, he was going to make an agreement and they were going to go a little bit further right. They didn’t. They went further left than Bernie was. So in the manifesto, Biden pledges to abolish cash bail. How about that? No cash bail. No bail, meaning that violent and dangerous criminals would simply be released after arrest. New York tried this insane policy and crime surged nearly 25% in New York City and now it’s up much, much higher than that. This is an old statistic. It’s up much higher than that. So nationwide, the Biden plan to abolish bail would release over 400,000 criminals on our streets. So all I’m saying is this. We have the greatest police departments. We have great police. We have great forces. They have to be allowed to do their job. And I’ve seen Pat and I’ve seen you. You’re going to have a bad apple. You’re going to have somebody who makes a horrible mistake. You’re going to have somebody has a bad moment, but it may be just a bad apple. We’ve seen it. But that doesn’t mean we’re going to close up our police departments. And like in Minneapolis, tell them to run. Leave, leave. Did you ever see anything like that? Where they left? Where they left? We can’t ever let that happen. We sent in the National Guard five or six days later. We waited, we waited, we waited. Within one hour, the whole thing was … You never heard of anything. On these monuments and statues, you saw that? They were trying to rip them down. They ripped some down. I immediately signed an order that if you get caught ripping down a monument or a statue, you get 10 years in jail. 10 years. And I don’t know about you, I haven’t seen too many statues being ripped down lately. They were going to have a march on Washington, Washington. They wanted to rip down statues. I said, “So wait a minute. You’re going to rip down statues, you’re going to go to jail for 10 years.” I signed it publicly. Very public. You got to let them know or otherwise, it’s not fair. They get 10 years, they didn’t know about it right? Wise guys. So we let them know you get 10 years in jail. I took an old law because they don’t do those laws today. Today, get that through the house. Tell Nancy Pelosi we’re going to give somebody 10 years. She’s terrible. Look at what’s happened to San Francisco. Look at the tents. Look at the homeless. That’s Nancy. She ought to go home and clean up her own city, but take a look. But it’s 10 years in jail. They were going to have a big march on Washington. They were going to come down and knock down. They had them earmarked. And as soon as they announced that, nobody showed up. It was amazing. Big march, nobody showed up. They said, “No, we’re going to do it the following …” That was a Thursday night. “We’re going to do it the next night, Friday.” Nobody showed up except four people. They all got arrested because they were the four people that the media had on top of the statue of Andrew Jackson doing damage. Almost got it down. And I’ll say something. The Washington, the D.C. police were great because they had the ropes. You saw the ropes. They were ready to pull it down. They were all set and our guys said, “Stop it.” And those guys ran in and that thing was over. Those Washington, those D.C. police did a job. That wasn’t like you know. They did a job. So we’re going to give you back your stature. We’re going to give you back your status. I hate to say it, but it’s been taken away. We’re going to give you back the right to be New York’s finest, the finest of all time, the greatest of all time, and we’re going to win on November 3rd. And the people that didn’t love Trump, never Trumpers, a lot of them are saying, “I’m starting to like Trump a lot,” because they see what’s happening. And we’re going to give New York a real shot and I think we have one hell of a shot at doing it. I just said this morning, the New York Post, which has been great. The New York post had a cover story about that. They came and interviewed me at the Oval Office and they talked about law and order in the city. And I said, “I did very well, Republican wise. I did very well.” We did great, and I really believe that that solid core of people has to be real. First of all, they’re leaving. A lot of them are leaving, but they have to be disgusted with what’s going on. So I said then and there and I said it today. I put it out today strongly, we’re going to go and give New York a real shot. I think we have a real chance of winning New York, but we’re going to give you so much of what you’re looking for. Because I know exactly it’s so easy you need leadership, you need money, you can’t defund. It has to go the other way. You need equipment. But what do you need more than anything else is your dignity and respect. You need respect, you need your dignity back and this guy has taken your dignity away and your respect away. And I am telling you on November 3rd you’re going to be getting it back like you haven’t gotten it back before. Because this is really a referendum. So I want to thank you very much. And Pat, thank you very much. Fellas thank you. How does the oval office for that sound? Okay? Good? Well, I just want to thank you that was incredible. I assumed it was given out because I see a lot of things given out and they shouldn’t be given out. But a special man, you are just really special people. You really are. You’re very brave people. I will say this, you read a lot of negatives. They have a lot of fake media, fake news, false news, call it whatever you want, corrupt news. But you have no idea how much the people of this country love our police departments, our police, our law enforcement, our border patrols, our ICE people. ICE they go into the toughest situations. They take out MS13 by the thousands and then they get abused. But they’re not really abused, they’re loved by the people of this country. And New York’s great police force is something that I grew up with. I used to go with my father in Brooklyn to a little, I shouldn’t tell you this, a little hamburger place for lunch. And we’d see these big cops come in and they were great. And everybody stood at attention when they walked in and we’re going to get that back. You’re respected just the same, but they don’t allow it to happen. We’re going to allow it to happen. You are great, great people. And remember this, you are loved by our country, loved by our country and respected by our country. And all we have to do is let you do your job, right? Just let you do your job. Pat, I think it might be appropriate. So we really do. We have New York city’s greatest mayor of all time. He took over a city that I don’t know, was worse. Maybe better. I don’t know what I’m going to ask Rudy what’s the difference between that city and the city of today? Certainly it caught up very quickly for a long while it was a lot better, but when Rudy ran it, it was incredible. The crime statistics, the murder. I hate to use that word, murder. I don’t know if this place has ever heard that word murder. It’s not into the word of murder. But when you look at the stats, I looked at them the other day it was incredible what he was able to do in a short period of time with only New York’s finest. Without New York’s finest he couldn’t have done it. He let them do the job and he had three very great commissioners. He keeps telling me three great commissioners. I always say, “Who is the best?” He doesn’t want to tell me maybe he’ll tell you. But I’ve asked him many times, “Who is the best Rudy I want to know who? Who is the best?” He’ll never tell me, but there’s always the best, right? There’s always somebody. But I just want to thank you. I want to thank Pat. I’d love to ask Rudy to say a few words. But I just want to thank you. I want to thank Pat. I’d love to ask Rudy to say a few words and we love you all. Thank you very much. Thank you. Does anyone else want to speak. Does anyone else want to … So again, it’s an honor that you came. I just want to pay my respects to a really good guy that I love. It’s my brother, he’s very ill and he would not have … I mean, he just said, “Don’t even think about it.” I really appreciate what he said. He’s having a very tough time, but I really appreciate being with you today. He respected you as much as I do. He respected you, like everybody. We all respect you and we’re going to let you do your job. We’re going to let you do your job. That’s all we have to do. Again, thank you very much. It’s such an honor to be with you, to get the endorsement pad of this group of incredible men and women is mind-blowing. Really it is. Mind blowing and just, I’m going to leave you with this very simple phrase. I will never, ever let you down. I will never let you down. Okay? Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
















"
"36","08-15-20","Let me provide a brief update on the China virus as well as our economic recovery, which is going really, very well as you probably have been hearing. Nearly 85% of jurisdictions all across our country are reporting a very steep decline in cases. And that’s despite the fact that we have the #1 testing program anywhere in the world. We’re up to almost 70 million tests, far beyond any other country. This week, cases nationwide have declined by 6%. The test positivity rate has fallen to just 6.5%, a 71% reduction from April and a 15% reduction from mid-July. That’s a big reduction. The hospitalization rate for the virus has been reduced by half since April. And I urge everyone to apply common sense mitigation. We know that and we are all doing that, and I want to thank the American people for rally doing such a great job. The United States has now administered over 70 million tests, more than all of the European Union combined. If you combine all of Europe, it’s less than what we do. Millions of point-of-care tests are processed in less than 24 hours and many in under 15 minutes. Nearly 80% of all commercial lab test results are now returned within 3 days, so we’ve gotten that number down from about 8 days to 3 days. And that’s only in the longer term lab cases. But we have many 15 minute tests, we have some 5 minute tests. The turnaround time for federal surge testing sites is just 2 days. So when you send them out, despite the fact that you have a delivery time, which you can’t do anything about, it’s all the way down to 2 days, that’s a very substantial reduction. A great job by the people that do it. We are focused on aggressively shielding the highest risk individuals, those living in nursing homes and long term care facilities, are less than 1% of the US population but account for nearly half of all fatalities. That’s an incredible thing. That’s why we have rush nursing home funding, protective gear, rapid testing equipment and we will announce additional measures to protect nursing home residents in the coming days. We’ve worked very hard with nursing home companies and also with the governors, 50 governors all around the United States and we have developed a very good relationship with most of the governors and I think for the most part they’re doing a really good job. They’re focused very heavily on nursing homes and when they need equipment that they can’t get, remember they’re supposed to get it but when they can’t get it we have tremendous amounts of equipment in stock. Thanks to my administration’s decisive action to save American jobs we are currently witnessing the fastest economic recovery in American history and that’s because the foundation that we set previously before the virus came and hit our shore, the foundation was so strong. We had such a strong foundation that we are recovering much faster than anybody anticipated. It turns out that it will be a very, very strong V and you’ll see that in just a second. So retail spending has fully recovered and is now at an all-time high. That’s not all-time for this month or last month, that’s at an all-time high and you see that with the chart. This was previous to the plague I call it, the plague coming into our land and really affected 188 … We’re dealing with 188 countries, and if you see, we’ve not only recovered but we’re at a much higher level than we were even then, that’s an incredible number that nobody thought would even be possible. So we’re currently witnessing the fastest economic recovery in American history. That’s an amazing statement. So retail spending is great and now if they would put up auto production has surged 28% and that’s your auto production which is right there so you’ll see that that’s now about even to where it was and that was at an all-time record high and we’re already even and if you had a chart for used cars you’d see that used car sales are setting a record and that’s great for production because when the used cars are practically not available, they’re very, very tight, that means you’re going to make a lot of new cars so that number is going to go up even beyond what it is right now but that’s a fantastic number. That’s a number that’s the equivalent of where it was and that was a record. So you see what’s happening with respect to the economy and the recovery and the stock market is almost at an all-time high in fact NASDAQ is at an all-time high. It’s at 14 days where we broke the record already over the last two months, so a lot of great things are happening. Through the historic relief package that I signed into law, we saved over 50 million American jobs, 50 million American jobs and the unemployment rate is rapidly going down, you see that, you’ve seen that and I think you’ll see it over the next two months and you’ll have a good report even prior to the election. You’re going to have a very good report. I think you’re going to have an incredible GDP, you’re going to have a tremendous report on business and a lot of it’s going to be released which is very fortunate prior to the election. I think the Democrats are going out of their way to try and do whatever they can to stop these kind of numbers, they don’t like these kind of numbers because they think it’ll hurt them in the election. I think we all have to pull together and we have to do the right job and we have to do what’s good for the American people. We were unfairly treated by China because they could have stopped it. With that being said China’s purchased the most amount of corn in history. Last week they purchased the two largest days in the history of corn purchase and a massive amount of soybeans, also cattle, so China’s been buying a lot of things and they are doing that to keep me happy but they’re dreaming about Joe Biden, they would love to have that happen but I don’t think that’s going to happen. They are dreaming about him and so is Iran dreaming about Joe and so are numerous other countries. They dream about it because if that happens they’ll own the United States and China I can tell you specifically will own the United States. We can’t let that happen. If you remember China had the worst year they’ve had in 67 years prior to the plague coming to our shores and we are now starting to do really well. We’re going to have a very good third quarter, maybe a great third quarter and we’re going to have an incredible next year unless somebody comes up and quadruples taxes which is what they’re talking about doing and also regulations, we’ve done more in terms of cutting regulations than any administration in history by far, whether it was four years or eight years or in one case more than eight years. We have in less than four years done more regulation cutting by far and we’re doing more as we go. Some of it’s statutory, you can only do it at a certain pace, you have to wait 90 days, you have to wait 120 days before you can take the next step. We have tremendous regulation cutting coming. With that being said we’re going to have certain regulations to protect the environment and also safety. Small business optimism has come surging back in June. It was higher than any month under the previous administration, think of that. So small business optimism was higher than any month under the previous administration and that is while we’re going through a pandemic, a worldwide pandemic, you have a number like that and when you see the numbers that we quoted just now as to what’s happening with cases and all of the other hospitalization rates, a lot of tremendous things are happening. Industrial production is increasing at the fastest rate ever recorded. I mean think of these numbers. I mean how does that happen. Industrial production is increasing at the fastest rate on record which is ever recorded. Consumer spending is expected to grow at an astronomical rate this quarter so we don’t have the number yet but it looks like it’s going to be at an astronomical rate. I want to say that I want college football to come back. These are strong, healthy, incredible people. These are people that want to play football very badly, a great, great talent, quarterback Trevor Lawrence called me two days ago. I spoke to him a couple of times. They said, “Sir, I want to just tell you we want it back, we want to play,” and he’s an incredible quarterback as you know from an incredible school, Clemson and he’s going to have a very good future in the NFL. He’s got everything, he’s got height, accuracy, a strong arm, and he’s fast. Other than that I guess he’s got some problems, but he’s got the whole package. I watched him last year running. He’s faster than the backs that were guarding. I think he’s going to be great, but he’s just a great young man. I talked to him actually for a long time. They want to play football. He made the statement that he feels he’s safer on the field, he’s safer on the field than he is outside of the field. He feels very safe and if you look, the SEC, the Big 12 and the ACC are back. They want to come back and I think they’re coming back. The Big 10, the Pac-12 are not and I wish they would and I just want to say it’s sort of sad because I’ve been fighting for football to come back. We’re trying to help the NFL, as long as they stand for our national anthem, as long as they honor our flag and our country, if they start kneeling I’m not going to be helping them much. Might come back but I won’t be watching. Neither will a lot of other people. Much might come back, but I won’t be watching. Neither will a lot of other people. I think what the NBA did was atrocious. I thought it was disgraceful the way they kneeled and their ratings are reflective of that. I think football has to get smart. It’s the NFL. Let’s see what happens, but if they do it, they learned their lesson I thought two years ago when people started not watching and when people really weren’t going to the games so much. A lot of empty seats all of a sudden. So they’re going to learn that lesson again if they don’t wise up. I just want to say so Trevor Lawrence, great. Some of the great people, SEC big 12, ACC. I want to thank them and I want to congratulate them for coming back. I want to also mention that CNN had a story that will they blame Trump for football in the swing states. What a dishonest story that is. Well, they blame me. I’m the one that’s pushing them to come back. So they want to try and blame me. So them and I guess the New York Times reported one person. It was one person in the story. One person said maybe it’s Trump’s fault. I’m the one pushing it back. So I’d like to see college football come back. I’d like to see them come back proud and strong. I was very impressed by Trevor. I was very impressed by other people that called me. Players called me, coaches called me, Coach O. You want to coach who’s central casting for a movie if you’re doing a movie, you have to put Coach O as the head because this guy is central casting. When you have guys like Nick Saban and others calling for it to come back, they want it to come back. These are great athletes. These are not people that seem to be at all susceptible to this horrible disease and they want to play football and we have great testing. So you’ll be able to test. The New York Times quoted one person, one person, and I’m the one pushing. So we’ll get it straight. I’m the one pushing for football to come back. I think if I wasn’t pushing, you wouldn’t have anything happening. So with that, we’ll take a few questions Steve please. Well we knew what thee vote was going to be, but we’ll be doing a snapback. You’ll be watching it next week. Yeah, you’ll be watching it next week. Probably not. No. I think we want to wait until after the election. Look, Iran wants me to lose so badly because if they do, Iran is a whole different ball game right now. They haven’t been sponsoring terror because they don’t have very much money to sponsor terror. They know we just captured four Iranian ships as you know, and we brought them into Houston. They were going to Venezuela. They’re not supposed to be doing that. Iran would love to have me defeated. If I win, which I hope to win, how can you not? When you see numbers like this, both on the virus and on the economy, I mean, we should win. We should all keep this incredible thing going. I built it once and I’ll build it again. I think the hardest part is done in terms of the economy and that’s with or without additional funds from Nancy Pelosi. They should have put the things in, whether you call it the Care Act or phase one, phase two, phase three, but they didn’t do that. They put it at the end. Things that they’re asking for that have nothing to do with corona. That have everything to do with radical left politics. Well we have a man in there for two months. He’s a very talented man. He’s a brilliant business person. He’s done great. He’s a very nice man also. Louis, he is working very hard, but as you know the Democrats aren’t approving the proper funding for postal and they’re not approving the proper funding for this ridiculous thing that they want to do, which is all mail in voting. If universal, you could call it mail in voting. Again, absentee voting is great. You request. I’m an absentee voter because I requested, I got, and then I sent in my vote. So that works out very well. That’s what we’ve had, but now they want to send in millions and millions of ballots and you see what’s happening. They’re being lost. They’re being discarded. They’re finding them in piles. It’s going to be a catastrophe. This is beyond the post office. Louis, DeJoy is working very hard. The post office has for decades lost billions and billions of dollars. I read numbers today that are unthinkable. What they want to do now is hit the post office with millions of ballots from certain states. If you look at what happened in New York and Virginia and various other places, it’s a catastrophe. They’re losing 20% of the votes. Nobody knows what’s happened. So we’re going to see what happens. I do say this universal mail in voting is going to be catastrophic. It’s going to make our country a laughingstock all over the world. You can’t send out millions of ballots and look at all of the tests. Look, you’ve seen them. There are many. Just look at New York. Look at New Jersey. Look at the catastrophe in New Jersey and New Jersey had more than just Patterson. Look at what’s going on in Virginia. Look at what’s happening with this mail in voting. It’s a disgrace. Absentee is good. Mail in universal is very, very bad. There’s no way they’re going to get it accurately. They’re off by 20 and 30%. This is beyond post office. Now with that being said, they want money for the universal mail in ballots and they’re not getting. Why? Because of them. We want money to go to people. They want money in order to bail out states that have done very poorly. The states that have done poorly, you know them as well as I do. These are run by Democrats, usually radical left Democrats. You take a look at what’s happening in Portland and we’ll go into Portland. We have to be asked. We’ll go into Portland, straighten it out in one hour like happened in Minneapolis. We’ll go straighten it out in one hour. We will straighten it out so fast, but they have to ask us. So they need money, but they’re not willing to approve the money that they need. If they can’t get the money that they need for universal mail in voting, I don’t see how they can have it. That’s not only post office. It’s also for the voting itself. Yeah, he’s a fantastic man. He wants to make the post office great again. Did you ever hear the expression? He wants to make the post office great again. The post office is a catastrophe. I don’t know. I don’t know what he’s doing. I can only tell you he’s a very smart man. He’ll be a great postmaster general. Obviously, if you’re going to do these millions of ballots out of nowhere, he’s going to obviously need funding. What the Democrats aren’t willing to provide other things and therefore they’re not going to get the funding for that, but you are going to have a catastrophic situation with universal mail in votes and on top of it, the Democrats aren’t willing to give the people the money and the post office the money. Well, the problem with the mail in voting number one, you’re never going to know when the election’s over. Okay. I mean, they called the election in New York for Carolyn Maloney. They shouldn’t have done that. I think you should redo that election. Baloney. They shouldn’t have done that. I think you should redo that election. And you know, the opponent is screaming that he can’t believe it. Ballots are lost, ballots are defrauded. It’s a total mess. And they called it for her. The reason is because I’ve been using it as a case, I’ve been using it as a case. So look, we are going to have an election that takes place on a beautiful day, November 3rd. And usually at the end of the evening, they say, “Donald Trump has won the election. Donald Trump is your new president.” Whatever they say, you know what? You’re not going to know this, possibly, if you really did it right, for months or for years, because these ballots are all going to be lost. They’re going to be gone, and just take a look at a smaller basis. But it’s great tests. We’re doing tests. I mean, you could call them polls. You could call them tests. Look at what’s happening all over the country, where you have universal mail-in, wait a minute. The ballots are lost, there’s fraud, there’s theft, it’s happening all over the place. Now, we’re going to do it with this whole vast, big section of the country? It’s crazy. No, not at all. He would love to see it happen. I didn’t speak to him about it, but I will tell you this. I would imagine he would say, number one, they didn’t give me the funding for it, because it’s sitting in Congress because they want a trillion dollars to bail out states, just so you understand what they want. They want a trillion dollars to bail out badly run, Democrat-run states. Okay. That’s what they want. They’re not giving the money to the post office. They have to give the money to the post office. No, the steps he's creating. Yeah. No, not at all. The steps that he’s taking are trying to stop the tremendous losses that have taken place for many, many years. He’s trying to streamline the post office and make it great again. Well, Wait a minute. You just threw, look, I just read last night that now New Jersey is going to try the universal mail-in voting. Well, they didn’t know this. So now all of a sudden New Jersey is going to be hit with millions of ballots to be sent out. They didn’t know anything about this. So how does a postal service that doesn’t know about it, now all of a sudden New Jersey is supposed to take out, and millions of ballots are going to be sent to all over New Jersey? And if you look at some of the things they say, take the state of Nevada, take that little scam that’s going on over there with the clubhouse politician governor, take that, where the votes don’t even have to be in till seven, they get counted seven days after November 3rd. That means, Nevada is a very important state, I think we have a great chance of winning that state. If the votes don’t have to be in for seven, and they’re not counting the votes, seven days later, that means how are they going to predict a winner on November 3rd? No, absentee is okay. But the Democrats are not, they are not approving the resources. You’re right. There has to be more resources. I agree. Because all of a sudden the post office is tripling up and… The problem is, the Democrats are not approving the funds necessary. It’s in there. Now they have 25 billion. I’ve seen 15 billion. I’ve seen a lot of money. I don’t know how you’re going to spend that much, but that’s what they’re saying. They’re saying. So not only do they want a trillion dollars to hand out as welfare to all these states that are run by Democrats doing badly, they want $25 billion for the post office, but they’re not approving it. Now, what I want is a lot of money, thousands of dollars to go to people because they need money. Despite the good numbers, despite numbers like that, they need money to live. And I want that to happen. The Democrats don’t care about that. They just want to give bailout money to their friends running big states poorly. Well I’m going to look at it. I mean, I’m not that aware of the Snowden situation, but I’m going to start looking at it. There are many, many people. It seems to be a split decision. There are many people think that he should be somehow treated differently, and other people think he did very bad things. And I’m going to take a very good look at it. I mean, I’ve seen people that are very conservative and very liberal and they agree on the same issue. They agree both ways. I’m going to take a look at that very strongly, Edward Snowden. Yeah, please. No. I mean, you can’t compare it to 1917. That was incredible. That was the worst ever by far. You look at that, they lost possibly a hundred million people. No, I don’t agree with that. But if you look at these numbers, they’re coming down very substantially. And I do believe that Americans, many are wearing masks, which is a good thing. Again, some people thought that you shouldn’t wear a mask. When this whole thing started, Dr. Fauci, who I like and respect said don’t wear masks. And so did Dr. Redfield. And then all of a sudden it was like, everybody should wear a mask. And that’s okay. People could change their mind. But wash your hands. Good hygiene. All of those things, I think people are really doing it to a level that they’ve never done before. And when you look at the numbers, the way the numbers are coming out, I mean, it’s very impressive when you see what’s happening. By the way, Florida doing well, did you see that? And hospitalizations and all, normally you would have had to build more, like we did for the first surge. We’ve done it right. We’ve closed it up. We had the greatest economy in history. We closed it up. We understand the disease now. Nobody knew, nobody knew what was hitting us. Nobody knew that old people would be very, very susceptible, especially if they have heart and diabetes problems, and other problems. That old people would be very susceptible and young people would be extremely good with it. If you look at the percentages, there are a tiny percentage that have problems, especially the big problem. So no, I think that we’re doing very well, we’re on our way. And we’re also opening up our economy, and our economy is going to set records. And if stupid people aren’t elected next year, we’re going to have one of the greatest years that we’ve ever had. Jennifer, go ahead, please. Well, the big thing is Huawei, right? Huawei’s not here. And Huawei, I’m not allowing. And I’ve told European countries, and others, Australia has been fantastic as an example, but Huawei’s not coming here. And we told certain countries that were thinking about Huawei, that’s okay. You can use them, but we’re not going to be sharing intelligence. And they’ve all backed away. You look at the UK, it looked like they were going that way. And now they’ve backed out. Scotland Yard. There are most, well, yeah, they were looking at other things. Yes, we are. We are. Well, you’ll have to ask him. I know this, he’s a very efficient operator, a very good operator, but again, he needs money to operate if you’re going to hit him with millions of ballots. And if you ask him, he will tell you, and he’ll tell you very nicely, you have the money, it’s sitting there. It’s ready to go. The Democrats don’t want to approve it, but I want money for other things too. I want money to go to people so they can live very nicely, because China caused the problem, they didn’t. So I have nothing to do with that. I read something about it, and I will say that he is a brilliant lawyer, I guess he wrote an article about it. So I know nothing about it, but it’s not something that bothers me. Why do you say that? I just don’t know about it. But it’s not something that we will be pursuing. Let me put it differently. Let me put it differently. Don’t tell me what I know. Let me put it differently. Let me put it differently. To me, it doesn’t bother me at all. I don’t know about it. I read one quick article. The lawyer happens to be a brilliant lawyer, as you probably know. He wrote an article saying there could be a problem. It’s not something that I’m going to be pursuing. I just told you, I have not gone into it in great detail. If she’s got a problem, you would have thought that she would have been vetted. You would have thought that she would have been vetted by Sleepy Joe. Yeah, go ahead. So I think we’ve done very well. We’ve had three phases. We’re into phase four. We’ve gotten everything we wanted. And we’ve also gotten a great economy. All you have to do is take a look at these charts. Our economy is doing good. But we want different things than them. I want money for the people. They want money to bail out Democrat governors, and Democrat mayors. Listen to me, listen to me. My people are doing very good. And my people call me, they’re in the office, they call me. They call me when it’s right. Nobody knows the deal better than I do. When it’s right, I’ll meet. But right now it’s not right. They want a trillion dollars to bail out badly run states. If they’re Democrat, they’re Democrat states. Will something happen? Possibly. But I want to tell you, the country is doing very well right now. We can live very happily with it, without it, but I’d like to do it because I want to give money to the people. I want to put money into the people’s hands. They want to put money at the politicians hands, so that the politicians don’t look stupid. Steve, please? Mark Yesper? Did you call him Yesper? Oh, okay. Some people call him Yesper. No, I get along with him. I get along with him fine. It’s fine. Yeah, no problem. I consider firing everybody. At some point, that’s what happens. Jennifer, do you have something Jennifer? You’re working so hard. So if we have the success, I think we have a silent majority the likes of which has never been seen before. I think you read about it. Where 62% of the people say they’re not even telling the truth on polling. And where the polling is fake. Where they do registered voters and where they do many more Democrats than they do Republican. Same as happened last time. But this year, I think we have much more enthusiasm. Maybe those people back there would understand it better than anybody. But I think there’s more enthusiasm for 2020 than there was even for 2016. And 2016 was a record. You found that out. And I believe there’s much more enthusiasm now than there was even in 2016. We have a silent majority, the likes of which nobody has seen. I just looked, there are thousands of boats in lakes, rivers, and oceans, thousands and thousands of boats. It’s called boaters for Trump voters. For Trump-Pence, there’s signs all over. Some of the boats have 10 flags on them. They’re incredible. There are thousands. We did nothing to do this. This is just generic. It just happened. Let me just tell you, I think the level of enthusiasm for what we’re doing, we want law and order. We want low taxes. They want to raise your taxes. They want to have open borders, and they want to defund the police. How do you win on that? They want to go to Texas, and they want to go to Pennsylvania and they want to stop fracking in Ohio. They want to stop fracking. They’re against steel, they’re against anything with petroleum, the word petroleum in it. You won’t have a country. These people are crazy. Say it, go ahead. Well, I don’t know. I think for next year, generally speaking, a lot of times, I understand when, if we win, a president will ask for the resignation of everybody, and then bring back the people he wants. That’s happened before Steve. And I could see something like that happening. I think that makes sense. No, I have a very good cabinet. I mean with few exceptions, I wouldn’t say I’m thrilled with everybody, frankly, but I have, overall, I think we have a very good cabinet. I think this, I will say this. No administration, none, no administration, first three and a half years, has done anywhere near what we’ve done. 300, we will have at the end of the first term, 300, maybe more, federal judges, including Court of Appeals, two Supreme Court Justices. Nobody has done this. Take a look at what we’ve done. The biggest tax cuts in history. Biggest regulation cuts in history. Rebuilt our military, took care of our vets. We have a 91% approval rating from the vets. Nobody’s ever had a 91% approval rating before. I guarded the Second Amendment. They want to destroy the Second Amendment. Take a look at Kamala. They want to destroy the Second Amendment. And as you know, Joe has no control over anybody. He has no control over himself. Okay. Thank you very much, everybody.
















"
"37","08-17-20","Well hello Oshkosh. Wow! I don’t know what happened. Something happened. This was supposed to be just a quick little small gathering. This is what’s happening and we call it a peaceful protest. We’re supposed to have 50 people, right? So we have a little more and they turned away a lot of people outside. So we’ll call it a peaceful protest. That way we could do whatever we want. You know that’s what they call it in New York and these different places Portland, when they’re rioting all over the streets they say it was a peaceful protest. So you can have thousands of people doing it we’ll do the same thing. I’m truly thrilled to be here with you. The hardworking patriots of Wisconsin. Thank you. Thank you. It’s a big group of people. This is like a rally I said it’s not supposed to be a rally. We’re not supposed to have a rally. I hereby grant to you a pardon. Thank you. Thank you very much. Well, I want to thank you. Thank you. In the months ahead we will need every ounce of your strength and drive and patriotism. We’re in a fight for the survival of our nation and civilization itself. We are really in a fight. This is the most important election we’ve ever had in my opinion. And I used to say it and I’d say it with great conviction, 2016 but you know what? That wasn’t crazy people we were dealing. They were on the edge, crooked Hillary was on the edge. She was on the verge. She became crazy later on when she lost. That’s what she became. But these are people that are seriously radical left. Joe Biden is nothing but their puppet. He has no clue what’s happening. And then baking speeches that are taped, who wants to listen to Michelle Obama do a tape speech? No, you got to have her get up there. But we’re doing a real speech on Thursday next Thursday, she’ll be listening. Doing it live from the white house, live from the white house. So we have plenty to say. So Joe Biden and the Democrats have pledged to oppose $4 trillion of new taxes. So this is a group of people that think it’s good to raise everybody’s taxes. In the old days a politician would lower taxes, right? The great Scott Walker is here, your governor. Scott would lower taxes, but now the whole thing I guess it’s changed. It’s gotten inside out. Now everybody says we’re going to raise your taxes, but Republicans are lowering your taxes. We gave you the biggest tax decrease of the history of our country and we’re going lower. But they’re going to massively increase your regulations. In addition to your taxes, they’re going to confiscate the guns of law abiding Americans. They’re going to take away your second amendment. They’re going to make America a sanctuary for criminal aliens. They’re going to keep those sanctuary cities. They love sanctuary cities. They’re going to protect the criminals, abolish American energy and make us reliant on foreign nations and force taxpayers to fund extreme late term abortion. That’s what they’re doing. They also want to abolish the suburbs by allowing far left Washington bureaucrats to force the construction of low income housing projects in every neighborhood in America. That’s what they want to do, that’s their goal. And we’re going to let you preserve your American dream in the suburbs. Okay? We ended the program. We ended the program. The voters of Wisconsin are very, very spectacular people. We are going to take care of you at every level. We are going to fight for you. We are going to fight for every single aspect that you have going. We are never going to forget you. You didn’t forget me in the last election so I want to thank you very much. Thank you everybody. Thank you. I want to thank you very much. It’s great. So we issued a regulation and we ended that regulation because when we talk about suburbs and we talk about other things we have taken care of about 84% of Obama regulations, executive orders. It’s amazing. We knocked out a big portion of what he did, including the wonderful mandate, right? The individual mandated Obamacare, which totally by the way, by far the worst of all of Obamacare. We took it out, essentially that ended Obamacare. And then you say so we knocked out 84% of what he did and then they say he was a wonderful president. Why was he a wonderful president if we knocked out in a very popular way knocked out 84%? The voters of Wisconsin face a simple choice. Do you want to be ruled by the radical left mob or do you want to stand tall as free men and women in the greatest country on earth and keep it that way? Do you want to crush our economy under the crazy socialist policies of sleepy Joe Biden and his boss Kamala Harris? And his other boss Nancy Pelosi, she’s a beauty. And his ruler Bernie Sanders, crazy Bernie. Or do you want to quickly rebuild the strongest economy in the history of the world? Which we did. We’re going to have to do it again. We’re going to have to do it again and we’re in the process of doing it. We’ve built the greatest economy on earth and now we’re doing it again. You look at all the numbers, we’re going to go over them. Do you want to fund and defame and dismantle the police? I don’t think so. Do you want to support the incredible heroes of law enforcement? Yes, right? Do you want your friends and family to be persecuted by the far left wing? It’s called cancel culture, right? Cancel culture. Or do you want to defend our history, our heroes, our faith, our values and our treasured American way of life, which is what we have? Now don’t believe the lies you’re going to hear on tape. Most of it is going to be tape. I wonder is Joe Biden taping his speech too because if he is, I think I’ll tape mine. How do you watch a tape? They talk about a convention. How do you watch a tape speech? I would imagine Joe is going to do everything he can to tape it. I saw them asking him questions today. It was a news conference and he read them off a teleprompter. I don’t get it. I don’t get it. Something going on up there. We can’t afford it. I can tell you this look, from doing this now we’ve built the greatest economy in the world, we rebuilt our military, we gave you the greatest tax cuts in history, we gave you the greatest regulation cuts. We became energy independent. We’ve done things that nobody thought possible, right? Nobody thought possible. We’ve done things that nobody ever thought you had the greatest year in the history of your state last year, greatest year. And when you look at the numbers, you’re going to have an even greater year next year, unless somebody comes in and quadruples your taxes. In which case it’s called the depression folks. It’s called it depression. It’s not going to happen because we’re going to win. Biden is just a Trojan horse for socialism. He’s a Trojan horse. He has no clue, but the people around him are tough and they’re smart. But we disagree with them very, very strongly. They’re mean and they’re angry like her. By the way, nobody treated Joe Biden worse than Kamala, right? She was worse than Pocahontas, She was worse than anybody on stage. Nobody treated him worse or with less respect. She had no respect. All of a sudden she’s now saying he’s the wonderful. She didn’t feel that way a little while ago. Let’s talk about her for a second. She left in shame. She started at 14 she left at two. She went in the wrong direction. So if a poll is any indication, that’s what we want, speak in the polls. Fake news, CNN. They probably have their cameras going thank you very much. No, no, no. Frankly, their pollster’s much better than Fox because Fox has never gotten it right. Fox pollster I don’t know who he is, but he hasn’t had a clue for about seven years. Let me just tell you that CNN gave us an increase of 10 or 11 points in just a short period of time that we went up and now they call it margin of error. Don’t believe it. We’re way beyond the margin of error don’t believe it. I just got back from Texas and Florida and Ohio. We were all over the place. We went to great states and every roadway and highway, we had thousands, tens of thousands. I would say at least on each one a hundred thousand people from the plane, because that’s why this isn’t a rally. This is again, friendly protest. We were not allowed to do rallies, right? Because of rules and regulations which we want to adhere to. But from the plane to an oil well, from the plane to getting law enforcement, all of the sheriffs in Florida gave us their full endorsement. And in Ohio we went to a plant Whirlpool. They were out of business, they were going out of business and now they’re a thriving company because they were dumping washing machines and dryers into our country and I stopped it. And I said, “You want to do that? We’re putting a massive tariff.” And all of a sudden Whirlpool and thousands of people that work in Ohio and other places it became a really terrific company again. And we went there. But if you look at the kind of enthusiasm we have, we have never had the enthusiasm that we have right now and that includes 2016. And I hate to say it and I don’t want to be rude because I would never be rude. But let me just tell you Joe Biden has no enthusiasm. No enthusiasm and you don’t win without enthusiasm. People aren’t saying we got to get him in. The only reason they want him in is they want to stop our great agenda. That’s the only reason, that’s the only thing he has going. And nobody wins when you’re not on the side of enthusiasm. So we have more than we ever had in 2016. And in 2016 nobody has ever seen a campaign with that kind of enthusiasm. And we have much more now. But the socialists will not stop until they’ve ransacked America and laid waste to our cities. Your eyes don’t lie look at Portland. It’s been turned into a war zone and we want to go in and solve it. We saved the courthouse, do you believe it? We had to send in Homeland security. They were great. They easily saved it after it was pounded. Portland was supposed to be watching it, but they weren’t. So we sent them in and we will send in the national guard just like we did in Minnesota. You saw what happened there, Minneapolis. The national guard went in within 15 minutes the whole thing was over. They should have called them in a week earlier. My beautiful, beautiful fifth Avenue in New York has been looted in pillage. It was allowed to happen by an incompetent mayor that doesn’t have a clue. Look at what’s happened to our diamond. New York was a diamond for the country. Look how far it’s gone down. And Chicago, the mayor literally raised up the drawbridges to prevent hordes of rioters from ransacking the city. Can you believe it? Can you believe it? 17 officers were injured in Chicago. They had a week. A little while ago during a weekend spree where 78 people were shot and 18 died. That’s worse than Afghanistan, which we’re getting out of. That’s worse than Iraq, which we’re almost out of. That’s worse than Syria, which we’re out of, except we kept the oil, but that’s okay. We don’t have to talk about that. But this is the future that Joe Biden plans to bring to every city, town, and suburb in our nation. And you know, for those suburbs, I keep hearing about suburban women. I made the … Oh. Well, in one speech recently, I called you suburban housewives and they all loved it, but what I got, they said, “Sir, I don’t know if that’s politically correct.” I said, “Don’t worry about it. They’ll get over it.” Right? But we saved the suburbs. The suburbs, and you know what I’m talking about. And they said about the rule, it’s a rule. Very strong. It’s like a law. They said, “Sir, we can amend it.” I said, “No, I don’t want it amended.” “No, we can really amend it. Bring it down.” “No, I don’t want it. I want it terminated.” And we terminated it. It’s gone. And it’ll be re-instituted if Joe Biden comes in. Not by him, because he has no idea what the law says or what it means, but by the people that will be running our country. It will not be him. It will not be him running our country. They will turn every city into a Portland and they wouldn’t mind. No one will be safe in a Biden run America. But while I’m president, the United States will use every tool and we’ve done it. By the way, our country is doing great. We have the pandemic should have never been allowed to happen by China. Should’ve never been allowed to happen. They released it. They didn’t release it in China, but it came to the United States and Europe. 188 all over the world. 188 countries all over the world. We’re not going to forget it. We’re not going to forget it, but we’re doing great coming back. We’re coming back and our numbers are better than almost all countries. I will tell you that. Despite what you hear. Look at all of them up there. Scott, look at all of that fake news. It’s unbelievable. Unfortunately, Fox has become fake news too. I don’t know what happens to these people, right? Do you agree? At least the other side, you know where they’re coming from. But I’ll use every tool at my disposal to arrest those violators of federal law and put them behind bars. And that’s what we’re doing. When they were ripping down the statues, our great statues, they were ripping them down. I passed and signed something that’s beautiful. It says 10 years in prison if you knock down a statue. Amazing. What happened? What happened, Scott? I don’t see it anymore. Now they go up and they look at his statue and they say, “I don’t know. 10 years is a long time.” They say, “Let’s get out of here.” But did you notice that three months ago, I signed it. They will get to have thousands of people march on Washington to rip down statues. And these people are sick. They’re anarchists. They were going to knock down Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, Abraham Lincoln. He was fair game. Abraham Lincoln. So I said, “These people are sick. They are troubled individuals. They’re anarchists and agitators. They’re not just protestors.” They call them peaceful protestors. You’re peaceful protestors on the record. You’re peaceful protestors. And by the way, you’re a lot … Look at this guy over here. Look at the size of that guy. You’re a lot tougher than they are. Just so you understand that, right? Look at the size of that guy. But Biden and Harris are pro-crime and anti- cop. There’s no other way to say it. And we’re anti-crime, we are pro-cop all the way. I’ve gotten the endorsement. I got the endorsement. Pat Lynch, New York City police. They gave us an endorsement first time, I think. He said I think it’s the first time they’ve ever done it. That means it’s been a long time. They don’t do that kind of thing. They endorsed me. All the sheriffs in Florida endorsed me. What you have all of the law enforcement in Texas endorsed me. We’re getting endorsement from … We haven’t found anybody that won’t endorse in law enforcement. We haven’t found anybody, and if we do, I think they’d probably be in big trouble. I really do. I think they’d be in big trouble because nobody could figure it out. We are getting the endorsement of law and these are great people. These are great Americans. These are people that want our people to be safe. So, we’re thrilled today to be joined by county sheriffs from across the state, and I am deeply honored to receive the endorsement of more than three dozen Wisconsin sheriffs. Where are you? Yeah. Yeah. Wow. Thank you, fellas. They’re good looking people. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I like that mask. MAGA. I wonder if he supports Trump? He’s got MAGA this big. I wonder if he’s a Trump … Hey, thank you, sheriffs. We appreciate it. Good looking guys. Good looking guys. And I’ll never let you down, sheriffs. I’ll never let you down. You know that. We gave you all of the surplus equipment. We had millions and millions of dollars of surplus equipment and Obama and Biden didn’t want to give it. They didn’t want to give it. They thought it looked too militaristic, meaning it was … A lot of it was really defensive equipment so that we can keep our law enforcement safe. And I distributed it. All of hundreds of millions of dollars. It was sitting there drawing dust and warehouses that we were probably paying a fortune for all over the country, and you got it. We all got it. Everybody got it. And everybody’s happy. As president and as your president, I will always stand with law enforcement, and that’s something that I can’t even imagine anybody saying anything differently, but this other side does. They say it differently. I mean, nobody can even understand it. This November, the voters of Wisconsin will not surrender their beloved state to the left wing mob, and that’s what would happen. In 78 days, we’re going to stop the radical left. We’re going to win the state of Wisconsin and we are going to win four more years. And then after that, we’ll go for another four years because you know what? They spied on my campaign. We should get a redo of four years. We caught them spying on the … Can you believe it? Did you see the FBI agent? He agreed. He’s pleading that he forged documents. Oh, that’s that’s good. No no. Wait until you see. It’s going to be incredible, but they spied on my campaign. They spied on our campaign. Nobody has ever seen anything like it. You can call it whatever you want. I use the word treason. They got caught. They got caught. The same people doing speeches on tape tonight. They got caught. So it’s too bad. So, we have some great friends with us tonight. I want to thank representative Glenn Grothman. Glenn, thank you very much. And Jim Sensenbrenner is around here someplace. Thank you, Jim. Thanks, Jim. These guys are warriors. Also, a woman who did so great, she was so great in Michigan. She headed up Michigan. And a Republican hadn’t won Michigan in many, many years. And we got a lot of car companies building right now in Michigan. Don’t we? Ronna McDaniel, Ronna McDaniel. We won Michigan. I said, “Get me the woman that kept calling me in Michigan. You have to come one more time, sir.” I said, “This is it.” Then I’d leave and she’d call the next day. “One more time.” But you know, she did a great job. Thank you very much. Ronna’s fantastic. Head of the RNC. And the head of the Wisconsin Republican party, Chairman Andrew Hit. Andrew, wait, how are we doing, Andrew? Looking good. Beautiful kids, Andrew. Good. Good. I’m going to blame you, Andrew, if they don’t do it. Okay. I’ll fire you so fast Andrew. Andrew’s done a great job. Thank you. I think we are looking great here. We won it last time and you remember what a big shockwave because the Republican hadn’t won it for a long time and they were waiting for Pennsylvania and we won Pennsylvania and we had lost every vote. We would have won, but they didn’t want to call it. It got later and later and later, then Wisconsin came in and then Michigan came in and then Pennsylvania came in. By that time, we already had North Carolina. It’s hard for Republicans. You have to run the whole board, because they started off that we’re going to play for New York. With all of the crime in New York, I got to play for New York, because we did well in New York. We did well in New York, but we’re going to play for New York. We’re going to play, I don’t know, guess we’ll do a little bit of a tiny shot maybe in California. They like me. And we’ll do a tiny little shot in Illinois. The other one we’re going to do, we’re going to go after New Jersey, we’re going to go after Virginia. We have a crazy governor of Virginia. He doesn’t want you to have guns and he doesn’t mind not only abortion, he doesn’t mind execution, because after birth, we’ll decide what to do with the baby, right? No, no. After. You hear this guy? First time I had heard of it. Scott, after birth, we will decide and we will discuss with the mother. And that’s the first time I’ve heard of it. This is the guy that likes to pretend he’s Michael Jackson, right? With the dancing. His wife saved a great embarrassment. We have another great friend of mine. A great, great politician, but really, he’s much more than a politician. He’s an exceptional human being. He is tough. I had to go against him of those presidential primaries and I want to tell you, there’s nobody tougher, but he basically loves this state. I mean, he loves this state and he should be your governor right now. He should be. He’s an exceptional man. Scott Walker, governor Scott Walker. Thank you. I’ll tell you one thing. He’s one of the most respected men. He goes into Washington, everybody stands up. They really do respect him a lot. And it’s really something. The next time you run, please don’t put marijuana on the ballot at the same time you’re running. You brought out like a million people that nobody ever knew were coming out, right? Because there was no way, but you can do whatever you want. You know that. You’re going to be successful, whatever you want to do. Thank you very much God for being here. So, before the virus came in from China, unemployment in Wisconsin had reached the lowest rate ever recorded. Ever recorded. That was part of Scott’s thing too. I have to give him a little credit there, right? I have to do that. But we created 15,000 Wisconsin manufacturing jobs. Everybody said that would be impossible. 121, 000 Wisconsinites were lifted out of poverty and 100,000 were lifted off of food stamps because they had good jobs. And we had created the single greatest economy in the history of the world. Our national economy was better than any economy that had ever happened before it. And China was having the worst year they had in 67 years. Not that I want that, but we took in billions of dollars. Nobody ever judged China for doing anything. What the money they took out of our country for so many years and the presidents that preceded me should be ashamed of themselves for allowing it to happen. And that includes sleepy Joe is part of that too. But then we were hit by the virus and I had to close it up. I took the greatest economy and I closed it up and we saved millions of lives, as many lives. It shouldn’t have been one, but what you see today, you could multiply it times 10 or 15 or maybe even 20. It would have been a horrible … It would not have been sustainable, and now we’re bringing it back and we’ll bring it back so strongly. I took unprecedented action to save the U.S. economy and support Wisconsin families. Under our Paycheck Protection Program, we helped save over 1 million Wisconsin jobs. Earlier this month, I issued a directive granting emergency payroll tax relief to every worker making under $100,000 per year. And this temporary relief will help tens of millions of American workers. That is something that people really … I’ll tell you, the great economists, that’s what they wanted. The payroll tax cut more than any other thing and it really applies. Number one, they open their business. It’s great for them, but really great for you, and it’s a big saving. It’s a lot of money in your pocket. If Republicans win in November, we will forgive these payments in full. Thanks to my administration’s policies, we’re now witnessing the fastest … And you’ve seen this, right? The fastest economic recovery in the history of our country. Over the past three months, we have already gained much more than nine million jobs nationwide. That’s a record. That’s not even close by the way. Nationwide, that’s a record. That’s not even close by the way. And you heard about the V, the V, the famous V and they said, “Well, maybe not a V. It’s got to be an M. It’s got to be an S. It’s got to be,” they have no clue. It’s turned out to be a super V because the numbers are much better. When you see the numbers coming, retail spending has fully recovered and is now at an all time high. And auto production has surged 28%. And in leaving the great plane right behind me and we have a lot of televisions, we have televisions in closets. I was saying to another group, we have televisions on floors and ceilings. You can’t escape it. If you want to get away from Trump, you can’t be in that plane because … the fake news and Trump, they’re going to go out of business. When I do leave, in let’s say 16, 20 years, something like that. No, when we leave, they’re all out of business. I wouldn’t say that sleepy Joe would be very exciting to cover. I don’t think a lot of, “Let’s turn on the television, let’s watch what Biden’s saying today darling.” But I just noticed on television that NASDAQ, that’s a big deal. NASDAQ hit an all time record today. The highest price ever, and the others are right behind it. I mean, who would think, we have a pandemic. I think we’re way on the other side of the pandemic, we’re doing great with vaccines and therapeutics and everything else, but regardless, we’re doing great with it, but who would think that we hit a record with NASDAQ and the others are right there. If you would have said we’re at 28,000 on the Dow, or just about and if you would have said NASDAQ hit a new record high, that’s great for your 401k’s. Look, you get the wrong person in here, your 401k’s, wave goodbye to them. There’ll be worthless. There’ll be worthless. 401ks, that’s one of the things. A lot of people are bragging. About four months ago, they were very depressed. I said, “Don’t sell, don’t sell. Don’t worry about, don’t sell, forget about this.” And most people held and they’re very, very good. But husbands come up to me and wives come up to me. And one wife was saying, “Sir, I always thought my husband was a financial loser, a total loser.” He was this big good-looking policemen actually. And she said, “He’s never been good with money, but over the years, over the last few years, I think he was up 89%.” I said, “That’s not as good as most people.” She said, “No, no. My husband is a financial genius.” And this good looking policeman looked at me and said, “Thank you, sir, because I was abused for a long time about the way I invested money.” And your 401ks are great. And your stocks are great. Then you see these big companies going up, that’s everybody, the stock market. That’s everybody. That’s just an indication. And they’re smart people. They know where it’s going. They have an instinct that’s better than most people. And they see what’s happening. Now with all of that, we have a headwind and the headwind is if for any reason we didn’t win, that stock market is going to go down like a rock goes through water. I hate to tell you folks, so good looking. If we didn’t have that headwind, your stocks would be even higher right now, even higher. So on election night, expect your 401k’s and your stocks to go very, very high. And I do believe we’re going to have a tremendous success. I do believe. Again, the most enthusiasm that anybody has ever seen in any election is this one. The most enthusiasm. So we got to get out and vote. You got to be careful with your ballots. Be careful, your absentee ballots great. Your others, you got to be very careful or go to vote. Just go to vote. Go to vote. We have a little problem here. You have a Democrat governor who is will do anything to turn things around. How’s Tom Tiffany doing, by the way? Another win, we just had a nice win, right? Tom is around here someplace. Tom Tiffany just had a great win. We’re winning a lot. We’ve won a lot of House seats. We’re going to definitely, we’re going to take back the House. We’re going to take back the House. As part of our great rebuilding the U.S. military we also signed a $5.5 billion contract to build combat ships in Marinette, Wisconsin, supporting thousands of jobs. We’ve totally rebuilt our military. We’ve spent $2.5 trillion, all made in the USA, all made in the USA. We have new fighter jets. We have new rockets. We’ve upgraded our nuclear, hope to God we never have to use it, but nobody’s even close. It was getting very tired. What we’ve done with our military is incredible with tanks. Speaking of tanks, we left our great tank, I was supposed to close down, we have a tank factory in Lima. Lima, Ohio, and it was scheduled to close. And I went to see it. And I said, “No way, we’re closing it because there’s no way we could ever reproduce that incredible,” and you know what happened? We didn’t close it. And we are buildings tanks like you wouldn’t believe. But what we’ve done with our military has been incredible. And Biden has promised to slash our defense budget, destroying critical jobs. But more importantly, if we don’t have defense, everything we talk about is meaningless. We have to have defense. Defense of our country, especially when you look at what’s happening outside of our borders. So we have the greatest, right now when I took it over was totally depleted. It was gone. Right now, we have the greatest military we’ve ever had, the greatest equipment by far we’ve ever had. If Kamala and Biden are ever elected, this recovery will come to a total shutdown to use their word permanently. For no scientific reason. Biden wants to inflict dramatic harm on millions of Americans with his basement strategy, locking everyone in their homes. You look at what’s happening with some of… And you got a dose of it right here, I hate to say, with some of these Democrat governors, they just don’t want to open it up. By the way, on November 4th, they’ll announce, “Well, we’ve decided to open.” November four. You got to get out to those polls. I’m serious. This is the most dangerous election we’ve ever had. The most dangerous, because I don’t think we can ever bring it back if they get in. I don’t think there’s anything called the comeback. It’ll be another Venezuela. I used to say that lightly. I now say it very strongly because it’s a similar ideology. This will be a large scale, very large scale, Venezuela if they win. We’re going to win. My administration by contrast is following the science, applying common sense, mitigation, sheltering, you know this, we got a shelter. We got to take care. But what do we really have to do? We have to take care of our elderly people, our elderly people with heart problems, with diabetes, and we’re launching Operation Warp Speed to deliver effective treatments and ultimately a vaccine and therapeutics. More than 270 therapies are in clinical trials. Can you believe it? 270. And you’re going to be hearing some very good news very, very soon. Now, we’re dealing with the deep state. So I’m watching it very closely. I don’t need to have them announce on November 4th, “Ladies and gentlemen, we’ve found the vaccine, it’s perfect.” I don’t need that. And hopefully everyone’s looking to do the right thing. We want to get it out quickly, but we’re very close, both on therapy and on therapeutics and on vaccines. Advances in treatment have reduced the fatality rate in adults by 85% since April. Think of that. Three vaccines are in the final stage of clinical trials and we’re mass producing doses already of that vaccine because we think it works and we’re going to have it out very quickly. We will defeat the China virus. We will have the greatest economy that we’ve ever had next year, unless somebody wants to quadruple your taxes and the crazy things that they’re talking about, we will have next year, the single greatest economy we’ve ever had. So Biden’s been there for 47 years and he’s personally supported every globalist sellout of the last half century. He voted for NAFTA. One of the worst trade deals in history. For the China entry into the World Trade Organization, a total catastrophe. For Korea, the Korean deal was horrible. We renegotiated it. Now it’s a really great deal for us. One in four U.S. manufacturing jobs disappeared almost overnight. Biden was strongly in favor of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Would have destroyed our automobile manufacturing business. It would have been a disaster for our country. I ended it, but I approved the Dakota Access Pipeline immediately. The Keystone Pipeline, 48,000 jobs. One of the great rip offs. It was done in my opinion, to hurt our country because we have so much energy. We’re now energy independent was I got out of this horrible Paris Climate Accord, which was a rip off on our country. It would have shipped millions of American jobs to China while allowing China to pollute with impunity. And they don’t even enter the agreement until 2030. So, it would have been a disaster. So many things are stacked against us. Even in the World Trade Organization, China is considered a developing nation. Therefore, they get tremendous, guess what? We don’t accept it. We’ve informed them, we don’t accept it. And we’re not approving any of those judges until such time as that ends. So time and again, sleepy Joe Biden put China first and America last, even to a point where his son who had absolutely… Where’s Hunter, has anyone seen Hunter? He’s had absolutely no experience, walked away with one and a half billion dollars to manage, that’s millions of dollars a year. And if you go to the pros of Wall Street, they’ll tell you it’s an impossibility. It was a 10 minute meeting. He walked away with one and a half billion from China. How do you think he’s going to do negotiating, Biden against China? Nobody’s done what I’ve done to China, to Russia. By the way, remember, we were going to be in a war with North Korea. What happened to the war? We’re getting along Kim Jong Un. We get along. Let’s see what happens. And meantime, it’s almost four years. Remember we were going to be in a war. Look at all those people back, that’s a lot of people. That’s a lot of people. Look at all the fake news. Isn’t that incredible. That’s a lot of fake news back there, Scott. At the end of Joe Biden’s eight years as vice president, nearly 2 million Americans of prime working age had dropped out of the workforce. Our factories were stolen. Our country was doing lousy. He lost nearly 200,000 manufacturing jobs. He was, by the way, a disaster on swine flu. He got a horrible rating in Gallup. Look at the Gallup poll. So they call it H1N1 right? You remember? H1 swine flu, H1N1. He calls it N1H1, but I don’t hold them in that one. That’s one of the small mistake. The bigger mistakes is what he says He’s at a different state when he’s speaking. “Great to be in the great state of Ohio,” but no, no, no, we’re not in Ohio. You know what you know what you do when that happens? You just walk off because there’s nothing you can do to recover. It’s happened to him like what, six times? Almost every time. That’s why he doesn’t talk. He’s shot, he’s shot. We got to say, look, one thing I’ve learned Putin, President Xi of China, Kim Jong Un, Erdogan of Turkey. They are world-class chess players. We can’t have a guy who’s shot and in his best years wasn’t very good. He wasn’t very good. We can’t have, these guys are world-class chess players. They’re all dreaming of Joe Biden. I’ll tell you who’s dreaming about them is Iran. If we win, and when we win, we are going to have a deal with Iran immediately. They’re just waiting, hoping that Biden gets in. Hoping John Kerry is saying, “Oh, he should have…” He, by the way, if anybody violated the Logan Act, it was John Kerry. John Kerry, not General Flynn. John Kerry. The cost of health insurance for American families had skyrocketed under Obama and Biden by $4,800 and nearly 11 million more Americans were on food stamps. So Biden’s abysmal record, but you do have to check swine flu because that was peanuts compared to this monster. This monster is the worst thing that’s happened in this world since 1917. Where it could have been a hundred million people died. Swine flu though, look at his ratings in Gallup, check them out. They gave them really bad ratings, Joe Biden. Not that that matters, but that does matter. When a guy is critical and we’ve done an incredible job, including among the best numbers in the world, Joe Biden’s abysmal record of failure and betrayal ended the day I took the oath of office. We got our people back working. We made real deals with foreign countries. I told Japan prime minister, Robbie, great guy, but I said, “Prime minister, you have to build places in Michigan. You have to build your places in other areas of our country. It’s not fair. We have a big deficit. Go to Wisconsin, go to Ohio, go to these places.” He said he’s going to do it. Many, many Japanese plants now are being built all over our country. Somebody had to ask him to do it. Somebody had to tell them to do it. It’s not fair. And it was all happening. Then it came in, now it’s going out, watch what’s going to happen. Watch how good the third quarter is. The third quarter is coming up right before the election. Watch how good Scott Walker … even you will be impressed by those numbers, even Scott. But we passed massive tax cuts. We passed massive regulation cuts, and you know what? You might not feel this, maybe the most important thing I did for making the economy great wasn’t just the tax cuts, it was the regulation cuts because the regulation cuts allowed companies to go out and build projects that they couldn’t get approved for 15 years and 20 years. Big deal. We replaced probably the worst trade deal ever NAFTA with the brand new USMCA, which puts us right at the top. And now Canada and Mexico are doing what’s right for our country. It’s been a great deal. And when the Wisconsin timber industry was being threatened by administration, took immediate action. We imposed tariffs on dumped foreign goods and subsidized products, saving countless timber jobs all across your state, and you know exactly what I’m talking about. You were taken advantage of by stupid US policy. Canada was taking advantage of this country. Not anymore. If Biden and the crew get in, the radical left will bring timber production to a total halt. I stood up to China’s decades of trading abuses. And when China targeted our farmers, we provided $28 billion in relief, we gave our farmers. I said to Secretary Perdue, secretary of agriculture, “Sonny, how much they’ve targeted our farmers. How much have they been targeted for? ” Sir, two years ago it was 12 billion, last year it was 16 billion, 28 billion total.” I said, “Guess what? We’re charging tariffs of $28 billion to China.” We charged so much more and we gave 12 billion, and 16 and 28. We gave … any farmers in here, any farmers? Did I do a good job for you, please? I don’t hear any farmers complaining. Am I right? We did a good job. I’ll tell you what, with a more typical president … I want to be nice, more typical, every farmer would be out of business right now, but we gave 28 billion to the farmers think of that. And the farmers are doing well. And then we signed a deal with China. And I was very excited because I had a very good relationship with President Xi. We signed a great deal. And under the deal, they would buy $240 billion, 50 billion of farm product and then manufacturing. Once the China flu came in, once the China stuff came in, I was not … really, I wasn’t, I couldn’t, it was different. But I have to tell you, four days ago, the corn order was the largest corn order in the history of ordering corn. It was the biggest China ordered two days. The biggest order in the history of corn. Then they did, if you look at soybeans, it was the largest soybean order in history, in history, and also beef cattle, et cetera. So it just shows you how smart China is. We sign a deal and the plague comes in. It might’ve been a mistake. It might’ve been on purpose. Who knows what happened? We’ll figure it out. But whatever it was, it was no good. They could have stopped it. But they know my attitude, I don’t like it. I don’t like it. So a normal country that’s not so smart in that position, Scott would have said, “Oh, we don’t like the way he’s talking about us. Let’s immediately shut down.” He didn’t do that. They said, “Let’s order more from the farmers than we’ve ever ordered. Biggest corn, biggest soybean, biggest cattle.” And now I’m getting my farmers saying, “Sir, we’re starting to like China.” I said, “You know what? We got to be very careful. Do you understand that?” So what they’ve done is they’ve gone out, they’ve made massive orders. So think how smart that is. 99% of people in that position would say, “Well, we’re not going to order anymore.” They say, “Let’s order so much that they become almost reliant on us.” Very smart, very, very smart. America has spent nearly four years cleaning up the mess we inherited from Joe Biden’s 47 year worth of disaster. It’s incredible. He’s in there for 47 years, he does nothing. Now all of a sudden, he’s going to do all these things. He’s going to get tough on China. Sure. China will own the United States if we don’t make this deal and we will [inaudible 00:51:00] if we don’t get elected, China will own the … mark by word. Well, I hope you’re not going to be able to test it out. China will own the United States. Iran will insist on an even better deal than they made with Obama. They got $150 billion, 1.8 billion in cash, green cash for nothing. We got nothing out of that deal. And I terminated that deal. I terminated that deal. And we moved the capital of Israel to Jerusalem. That’s for the evangelicals. It’s amazing with that. The evangelicals are more excited about that than Jewish people. It’s incredible. But we did, we did that. And Golan Heights, don’t forget Golan Heights. We did Golan Heights. So we’ve done a lot. In February, Biden said, “If you elect me your taxes are going to be raised. They’re not going to be cut.” Now [inaudible 00:07:05], how the hell do you do this? That will [inaudible 00:07:09]. Only in this state can we get away with it, but you happen to be right. You happen to be right. So I just want to say this. This has been an incredible experience for me getting to know you. I’ve been here a lot. We won this state. We weren’t expected to win this state. We’ve been great for each other. We’ve been great for each other. It’s a partnership in a sense, but we’ve been great for each other. We brought a lot of business to this state. We’re bringing a lot more business to this state, whether it’s the ships, or the crops or any one of so many different things, especially maybe the trade deal with Canada and Mexico, because of Wisconsin and your specialized milk, a small subject, but the right farmers got me at the right time and they said, “Wow, you guys are really being taken advantage of with Canada charging you 287% tariff.” I think you mostly know about that. But unless you were up here a lot like I was, you’d never find that out. And I worked with Scott and I worked with others and we solved all of these problems. We solved all of them, Scott, right? This is the most important election we ever had. We’ve got to stop these radical left maniacs. We’ve got to win this election. We have many things to do. We want to finish it up. It’s no different. You plant a tree, it takes a little time to grab on. In addition, we have other things we’re going to do. More regulation cutting, even more tax cutting. We’re going to be doing very substantial tax cuts because that’s an incentive toward growth and we’re going to do it. And we prove to be right. We prove to be 100% right. We’re not letting them raise your taxes on you and destroy everything that we’ve done. So I just want to thank the incredible people of Wisconsin. You really are. You really are. You’re a state that despite everything, everything that they were saying, “Well, Wisconsin, can’t be one.” Guess what? And I think we’re way far ahead. I do believe we’re way far ahead. Where we were, if you look back four years, I think we have much more spirit. You see, this as easier in a sense. Now, the virus made it a little bit more difficult, maybe a lot more difficult because all of a sudden, something happened that nobody ever even thought about, but we handled it. We handled it and we handled it well. And we’re now helping other countries with the ventilators and other things. But the easier part is, I used to come up as a businessman. I was very successful. And I’d say, “We’re going to do this. We’re going to do tax cuts. We’re going to …” Even Space Force, I never even talked about Space Force, but we did more … somebody said we actually did more than we promised. That’s never happened with a politician before. We did actually more, but I never talked about Space Force. And then I got into office. I said, “We need that.” Because you look at what China’s doing, what Russia’s doing, what others are looking at. So we have Space Force first time in 78 years since the air force that that’s happened, full scale, so it’s great, and you’re a big beneficiary of that as you know. So we have to win the election. We can’t play games. Get out and vote. Do those a beautiful absentee ballots or just make sure your vote gets counted. Make sure because the only way we’re going to lose this election is if the election is rigged, remember that. It’s the only way we’re going to lose this election. So we have to be very careful. Look, we have more than this election, that’s a big statement. The only way they’re going to win is that way. And we can’t let that happen. And our post office, we’re going to make our post office great. It’s been a disaster for many years. We’re going to take care of the men and women in the post office and we’re going to make it great. Right now it’s a laughingstock. Amazon and these companies come and they drop all of their packages into the post office. And the post office loses just hundreds of billions of dollars delivering these packages. Let them deliver it or let them pay the right price. So that’s it. But we’re going to make our post office strong. We’re going to make our post office really strong and really great. We’re going to be proud of it again. It lost $78 billion in a short period of time over the last 12 or 13 years, $78 billion. We want to make our post office strong. We want to be proud of it. I want to thank you very much. You’ve been my friends, my true friends. We will win and we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.

"38","08-18-20","Oh, thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Well, thank you very much. Thank you very much. And considering that we caught President Obama and sleepy Joe Biden, spying on our campaign, treason, will probably be entitled to another four more years after that. I wanted to thank you, and Art and Brandon, you’re incredible. I’ve known you now a long time. Right from the beginning, we had the chemistry, we had that good chemistry… Oh, sit down. It’s 122 degrees in this place. And we have our great Governor. Governor, can we make it a little bit, just a little. This is like a test. You think Joe Biden could do this? I don’t think so. So I’m thrilled to be in Yuma, Arizona To proudly accept the endorsement of the National Border Patrol Council, that’s a big deal. And they are great friends of mine. And we’re building the wall. Next week, we’ll be up to 300 miles of incredible wall. And our numbers are the best. We are very tough at the border. When people want to come in, for our farmers, et cetera, et cetera, we’re not going to hurt our farmers, but we’ve never had better numbers than we have right now. And that’s been helped because we’re at a little bit over 280 miles right now, we have never been helped like this. Wall, there are two things, in a thousand years you can come back, two things will never, with technology it’s obsolete before you even put it in the box, but two things never get old wheels and walls. Wheels and wall. If you come back in a thousand years, you’ll say, “Well, we still have wheels in walls.” And that’s the only thing you’ll recognize. The National Border Patrol Council is the official union representing the incredible heroes of the United States Border Patrol. They’ve been my friends from the beginning. To every border agent, and I just met some unbelievable people backstage, these are great people, and every family member here today, you have earned the everlasting gratitude of our nation. And I want to thank you very much. Thank you very much. As you know, better than anyone, the survival of our nation is at stake in this election. And I will tell you, I never thought I’d say it because we had a great election. We had a great election a little while ago. Four years ago, I never thought I’d say anything could compete with 2016. This election that we’re going into is the most important election in the history of our country, because we had crooked Hillary, but this is something, these people are sick. And we have to make sure that this radical left socialist and beyond, because this is beyond socialism, that it doesn’t happen, or we will indeed have Venezuela on steroids. So we can’t do it. Most important election, November 3rd, get out and vote. Joe Biden is the puppet of the radical left wing movement that seeks the complete elimination of America’s borders and boundaries. They want to take the wall down, they don’t want to have borders, they want to have sanctuary cities, lots of bad things they want. Following orders from his boss. I guess his new boss is Bernie Sanders. Can you believe that? Crazy Bernie. Joe Biden has pledged to abolish immigration enforcement, suspend all removals, provide free government healthcare, and they want to give it to illegal aliens. You don’t get it. Restore, catching and release. Shield violent criminal aliens. This is what they want to do. And give every illegal alien on the planet earth a free ticket to invent an asylum claim, and gain automatic admission into our country. We will have people coming into our country that never even thought of it before. You get free education, you get free healthcare, why wouldn’t they come? Let’s go to America. The Biden plan would unleash a flood of illegal immigration like the world has never seen. It’s crazy. Biden’s plan is the most radical, extreme, reckless, dangerous, and deadly immigration plan ever put forward by a major party candidate. It must be defeated, and it will be defeated on November 3rd. It will be defeated. At last night’s Democrat convention, which by the way, got very bad ratings, I have to tell you. Unity. They talk about unity. They want to bring unity. And then you listen to Michelle Obama’s speech, which was obsolete by the time it got there. She taped it. No, she taped the speech. It was obsolete. She must have taped it about three weeks before. I’m speaking next Thursday, maybe I’ll tape it. But I don’t think that goes. That’s so much nicer, to tape it, you do it, nice air conditioned room. And she not only taped it, but tell me when you hear a divisive speech… They talk about me as being a divider. I’m not a divider. I bring people together. We were bringing people together. We were bringing people together, like never before. Success was bringing everyone together, and then we got hit with the China virus, but we were bringing people together. But one of the opening speakers last night said that America will go to hell if we don’t have open borders. Think of that. Go to hell. When a country doesn’t have borders, you don’t have a country. Today, a Democrat speaker at the convention said, “We’re talking about abolishing the police, we’re talking about abolishing ICE, we’re talking about abolishing prisons.” Biden’s campaign has turned into a cult for open border and others Zealots. By the way, they want to double and triple your taxes, they want to increase regulations, they want to spend very little money on our vets, after we took care of our vets better than anyone’s. 91% approval rate. And they want to spend much less on our military, we’ve totally rebuilt. Two and a half trillion dollars, we’ve totally rebuilt our military. Bernie Sanders declared, in his speech, many of the ideas that just a few years ago were considered radical, are now mainstream. That’s Bernie Sanders. Because Joe, he doesn’t know where he is. But if he did, he’s been brought so far left that our country will not be the country that we know. It will have problems, it will go down. Your stocks will be gone, your 401ks will disappear. And right now, who has the 401k? And then the rest of you, many of you have stocks, and you do it a different way. That will go down 50, 60, 70%, 80%. And if you held on, like I said to do, we went down a little while we got hit with a virus. Now, NASDAQ just broke an all time record. SNP, just broke an all time record. Socialism is the mainstream of the Biden campaign and it’s not the mainstream of America. Remember I said, we will never have a socialist country. On November 3rd. The people of Arizona, our great state, we love Arizona. I won it last time, by a lot. And I hear we’re going to win it by even more this time. Don’t forget, last time I talked, I said we’re going to give you a tax cuts, I gave you. I said, we’re going to give you a massive regulation cuts. Give you your tax cuts, I gave them to you. I said we’re going to give you massive regulation cuts, we’re going to give you great everything. We even did Right to Try medicine. You know all about that. We did things that I didn’t even talk about it, we did. We did a thing called the Space Force. You never heard me talking about. I’m the only candidate that gave you more than I promised in the campaign. It’s true. I’m the only one ever, maybe ever. Or we’ll head to the polls and together we’ll stop the left and win four more years in the White House. We’re joined today by some incredible people, friends of mine, great, great people. And I want to congratulate your governor because we had a spike and he knocked that spike out so fast. I don’t know. Are you sure you even had a spike? Doug Ducey, a great governor, great man, and a somebody that won by about 16 or 17 points. That’s not so bad. And I think you’re more popular today. What a job you’ve done. Thank you very much, Doug. A friend of mine and somebody who’s a great fighter pilot, and I had a lot of people tell me she could really wheel the Warthog, right? The Warthog. She said, “I love that plane,” but she was a great, great fighter pilot, one of the best they were telling me. This was a group and they knew a very well. A lot of friends you have. And specifically she said, “Could you extend that plane? That’s the best plane. It never breaks down. It just is a winner.” But Martha McSally is an extraordinary person, and she’s fighting for us, and she’s helping us, and we have to bring her into the center. Thank you, Martha. And she’s running against a gentlemen who is, when you read what he’s done, when you read what he said about the second amendment and about all other things, you’re not going to want to vote for. You’re not going to want to have them play with your second amendment. I’ll tell you what. If I weren’t President, I don’t believe, Doug, you’d have a second amendment right now. I don’t think you’d have. The pressure that was put on to get rid of it, or to basically obliterate it, make it so it’s meaningless. You will always have the right to bear arms. You will always have that. A few friends of mine who are warriors. Paul Gosar. Paul. Where’s Paul? Paul, stand up. Will you? Paul Gosar. Thank you, Paul. Appreciate. Great job you’re doing. These are warriors. They really are. When they went and they tried to make a play at your President, they had to get through the House. What were we? 197 and nothing. That’s never happened before. Everybody came together. The Republicans came. Other than Mitt Romney, one half a vote. One half a brain. Another friend of mine and incredible fighter, and somebody that loves his state, and I’ll tell you, the Freedom Caucus, right? And we have a man named Andy Biggs here. He’s a fighter. He’s a fighter. And he loves our vets, and he loves our military, and you love our second amendment, right? And we’re not going to do anything with it. They will destroy that second amendment. Just remember I said it, but you’re not going to have to worry about it because it’s not going to happen. A woman who really distinguished herself, she became a star. She became a star overnight. There was nobody tougher. There was nobody smarter. There was nobody better than Debbie Lesko. Great job, Debbie. Thank you. We want her on our side. Right fellas? We got to have her on our side. Also, thanks to Arizona Republican party chairman, I knew this was going to happen. I knew that she was going. She never stops. She never gives up. Kelly Ward. Kelly, thank you. Thank you, Kelly. Great job you’re doing. Are we winning? Okay, good. I think we are. That’s what they say. We better win. If we don’t win, this country is in big trouble. Big trouble. Also a great friend of all of ours, former State Treasurer of Arizona, Jeff DeWitt. Thank you Jeff. And a man who didn’t choke under pressure. I don’t even know if he’s here. I think he might be here. He never choked. He kicked for 11 years. You know what that is? You ever see a golfer. They miss a three footer. They miss a three footer. They can’t take it back. They choke, choke, choke. Well, kickers are the same. Right? NFL kickers. This guy lasted 11 years. He’s one of the best kickers ever. NFL kicker, Jay Feely. Where’s Jay? Where is Jay? He’s here someplace. Where is he? Jay? What happened? You couldn’t get a good seat, Jay. I remember the 61 yarder. That was a heartbreaker. Right? But the only thing is, I’ll bet you this man would stand, only stand, for our National Anthem. That’s one thing. That’s one thing I can tell you. And if they don’t stand for our flag, if they don’t stand for our National Anthem, I turn off the game. Other than that, I’d like to watch, but I turn off the game. And by the way, I thought they learned that lesson a little while ago. I thought they learned that lesson two years ago, but maybe not, but they will. They’ll learn it again. This time it’ll go even faster. For decades, Washington politicians like Biden allowed an endless supply of illegal foreign labor to decimate American jobs and wages. Also, the crime was incredible what happened. They allowed criminal gangs to menace, maim and terrorize innocent citizens. They came in. They would maim and terrorize, and we have done something with our border patrol. And by the way, ICE, ICE is great. ICE has taken out thousands and thousands of MS-13, and you don’t want the job. There’s some tough people here. None of you want the job. It’s a tough job, but they like it, and they’re great Patriots, and they’ve done a fantastic job. They ceded control of the border to the most dangerous and ruthless cartels on earth. This is what would happen. They have ceded. And what we’ve done, did you ever notice the caravans? What happened? Debbie, there are no more caravans. What happened? What happened to the caravans? They don’t come up anymore. The caravans don’t come up. You know, we were paying hundreds of millions of dollars to Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, hundreds of millions. And I said, “Well, why are we doing that?” And they wouldn’t take. When we caught a murderer and we wanted to bring it back to one of those countries, they wouldn’t take him. And they wouldn’t take him under the Obama administration. So we got stuck with them because they’d fly in. They’d say, “Don’t land your plane.” And I said something very simple. I said, “That’s okay. We don’t have to do that. We’re not going to pay you anymore. We stopped payment.” We stopped payment. It’s amazing how that works, Doug. Right? We stopped payment and they called. They said, “We’d love to take them. We’d be honored to take them.” So we take them back by the thousands, by the thousands. They let lethal poisonous drugs pour freely into our schools and our communities, but no more. It’s not happening anymore. The cruel and heartless portrayal of the American people ended the day I took the oath of office, and now that we have more than half of the wall built, and do you notice they don’t talk about the wall anymore. They don’t talk. Why don’t you talk? I went, “Look at all those people back there.” That’s called fake news, fake news. Look at them. It’s the fake news. They don’t talk about the wall anymore. See, we won. We got the wall. It’s going to be up to 300 next week and it’s going to be finished very soon. And as soon as we want, all of a sudden, they never talk about it. But you know where I talk about it? Numbers. The numbers are so good. The numbers are so low. We’ve never had numbers like this because that big portion of wall already built, you don’t get through it. You can’t get through it. You can climb Mount Everest, and you’re going to have an awful hard time getting over that sucker. I stood up to the lobbyists. Everybody fought us, the Democrats, everyone. I fought the special interests. I kept every single promise that I made, and now I’m doing it with the drug companies. I just created Favorite Nation. So if a nation buys it for less and they buy it for a fraction of what we pay, the drug companies have to sell it to us for the same price. And they’re spending so much. They’re spending millions of dollars on advertising. Anytime you see an ad from a drug company, and they’re rich, the farmer, it’s called Big Farmer, the number one lobbyist. They spend millions and millions, hundreds of millions of dollars online. Anytime you see, anytime at all, you see an ad by Big Farmer against me, you know your drug prices are coming down. That’s what it is. They’re not happy. And we’re giving the rebate that creates tremendous wealth for the middle man, the rebate. It’s going to the people now. We’re bringing the rebate and it’s going to the people. They are not happy. I have a lot of people in that industry do not like me too much. But you are going to get 50. You are going to get, and the Democrats would never do it, Biden would never do it because he doesn’t understand it, but they would never do it. They would in a million years, they wouldn’t do it. It took a lot of guts to do it. I had a lot of people, a lot of good politicians go, “Sir, I don’t think you should do it.” I wonder why you’re saying that, but we did it. We’re going to have drug prices reduced over a very short period of time, by not 2%, and last year they went down a little bit, first time in 51 years that drug prices went down but a little bit, we’re going to have prices dropping 50, 60, and even 70%. Drugs. About time. And I’m proud to say that they’ve achieved the most secure border, our border patrol, in the history of the United States of America. We now have the most secure border we’ve ever had and it’s only going to get better. And we want people to come in, but we want them to come in through merit, right? And we want people to come in, but we want them to come in through merit, right? And we want people that are going to come in and are going to love for our country, not hate our country. Here in Yuma, Arizona, we’ve invested over $1.7 billion and poured 180,000 cubic yards, that’s a lot of concrete, to build 108 miles of powerful border wall. I know who’s going to vote for me. I don’t know though, I think I’m going to win Yuma. What do you think, Doug? I think, when I hear those numbers, when we hear those numbers, we’re winning. We’re going to win Yuma big. Now you see it and you see what’s going up and it’s an incredible structure, all capable, all wired up for cameras, for everything you can have. Technology is incredible. In total, I’ve already completely planned for the final execution, we’re going to have, by the end of the year, everything that we said is going to be built. We may actually build some more in some soft areas that we’ve noticed over the last two years. So we actually may put up some additional, but we will have it completed, everything we said, by the end of the year and nobody thought that was possible. And we’ve reduced illegal border crossings by 60% since this time last year. And if we keep going at the rate, it’ll be about 85% in about two months. So it’s a great honor. And you know what? Your community is much safer, you see the difference, it’s a much safer place to be. But more important than these numbers is the fact that we’ve ended catch and release. You know what catch and release is? These great men and women catch somebody, maybe a murderer, maybe a rapist, maybe a trafficker, they catch somebody, take his name, take his number and they release them into our country. And they say, “Come back in four years, you have a trial.” No more. We take them out. We bring them out. And nobody said that was possible because I couldn’t have gotten it through the Democrats because they don’t like that. So we have people coming in to this country, some great people, some really bad people too. And I mean murders and I mean rapist, I mean really bad people and they don’t get in and they don’t get back. When we bring them back to their country, could be Mexico also, they don’t come back. Under the Obama Biden, I call it OBiden, Under the OBiden administration, our agents were ordered to ignore the law and release illegal aliens by the hundreds of thousands. And by the way, Mark Morgan, where’s the great Mark Morgan? He’s around here someplace. Mark Morgan has been so incredible, one of our executives, he said, “We never built the cages. Those cages were built in 2014 by Obama.” We never the cages, they were built by Obama and the fake news is constantly saying that I built cages for children. I didn’t build them. They were built in 2014. There was a headline in Time magazine about the cage and somebody called in that built it. They said, “He didn’t build it, we built that for the Obama administration.” But they don’t stop, they keep calling it, they say I built the cages. You’ll hear it in one of the debates. They’ll say, “You built cages president.” I said, “No, I didn’t build cages. That was built by Obama.” Under the Trump administration, if you cross our border illegally, you are quickly apprehended and swiftly returned back home. We are proudly defending the job safety and security of the American people, which is what I promised to do. Nobody told me it was going to be this hard. Nobody told me I was going to have the Democrats go totally crazy. This was like a life and death war. You know why they don’t talk about it anymore? Because they know it’s bad politics, because they know having a wall, they can’t win that one. So they just say, “Let’s forget it ever happened.’ Because we won and they say, “Let’s forget.” They don’t want to talk about it. That includes the millions of incredible Hispanic Americans who follow our laws, uplift our community and protect our nation, in uniform. Half of all border patrol agents are Hispanic Americans, I was just with them. And today I salute each and every one of those true American heroes and that’s what they are. And nobody understands the border better than Hispanics. They know what’s good, what’s bad. They don’t want bad people coming into our country, taking their jobs, taking their homes, causing crime. Hispanic Americans are the people that are most in favor of what we’re doing on the border because they understand it. They understand it better than anybody. With the help of these patriots, we’ve stopped the rampant asylum fraud, shut down the human smugglers and we’re finding the drug dealers, traffickers, predators, and we’re throwing them to hell in jail or sending them back home. MS-13, for the first time that you’ve ever seen this, MS-13 is totally on the run. Many of its leaders are right now behind bars and we’re deporting its members in record numbers we’ve never reported. I can’t believe how many there are. But if Biden wins, it will be a giant jail break for MS-13 and vicious criminal gangs. China wants him to win so badly. Iran wants him to win so badly. When we win, I’ll have a deal with the red within a month, watch, because they’re dying to make a deal. But that last hope that Biden will win, they will own our country, China, they will own our country. We made such a great deal. Last week they had the largest order of corn in the history of our country, the largest single order. Then they did it again. You know why they’re doing that? Because they know I’m angry, because they know I don’t care so much anymore. We made a great trade deal, but I don’t care. But it shows you how smart they are, Doug. Another with normal brain power, they’d say, “Well, I’m not going to buy any more corn.” That’s good. And we’ll just decouple, thank you very much. But they go the opposite. They buy so much, good record numbers, soybeans record numbers. Last week, biggest ever, 42% of our farmers crop is now China, over the last little while. You know why? Because they don’t want bad things to happen, that’s why. So they’re very smart. When I have every farmer in the country calling and saying, “Please don’t do anything.” They’re very, very smart, but we can never forget what China did to this country and did to the world. The historic achievements that I’ve discussed today are only a slim fraction of the extraordinary accomplishment that we’ve all done together in the last four years. Here’s just a short list of our landmarks. Really they are landmarks, true landmarks. We instituted a national security travel ban on the world’s most dangerous regions, including jihadist regions, keeping terrorists and extremists out of our country. Everyone said, “Oh, that’s so bad.” Remember when they said, “Oh, that’s so bad.” I don’t think it’s so bad at all. We won the travel ban. The fake news said we didn’t because we lost in the lower court, we lost in the second court and we won in the Supreme court. So they said we lost. Can you believe it? They said we lost Debbie, because we lost the first two, but we won in the Supreme court, so they said, “They lost.” I guess, technically they’re right, we lost when it didn’t matter. But we have it. We have a great travel ban now for countries that are not countries where we want the people coming in. Over the last three years, ICE officers have made over 380,000 arrests of aliens with criminal records, including those charged or convicted of over 145,000 assaults, 40,000 sex crimes and 5, 800 murders. Over the last three years, border patrol and ICE have seized over two million pounds of fentanyl, heroin, meth, and other deadly narcotics. And you see it all the time. We stripped federal grant funding from deadly sanctuary cities. They want to have a sanctuary city, not going to be like the old days. We canceled the lawless policies of the previous administration and empowered border agents and ICE officers to do their jobs and proudly enforce the laws of the United States of America. We removed 20,000 gang members, including 4,500, MS-13. That’s pretty good. Who would ever think there’s that many? I entered into three landmark agreements with Honduras and El Salvador and Guatemala to end the abuse of the asylum system. We cut down that payment that I was talking about substantially and they’re still very happy and they are working with us very well and that includes Mexico. Right now, Mexico has 27,000 of their soldiers on our Southern border, helping us to guard our Southern border. And we’re giving you the tools to do the job that you signed up for. That’s what we’ve done. I entered into a historic partnership with Mexico, known as the migrant protection protocols, to safely return asylum seekers to Mexico, while awaiting hearings in the United States. You know about that. We had to have them in the United States and we captured them, we had to keep him here. I said, “No, no, we don’t want them here. We want them outside.” We got sued all over the place that we won. So now they don’t come into the United States, they can wait outside. For the first time ever, the United States is now exercising our full legal authority to expedited removal. We don’t have to go through years and years of litigation. You need Perry Mason to try and win. We ended the Obama Biden policy of giving work permits to newly arriving, illegal aliens. Think of that one. We established the national vetting center, the most advanced visa screening system, anywhere in the world. We know so much about the people coming in. We know the good and we know the bad. We’ve suspended refugee resettlements from the world’s most dangerous regions, because nothing is more important than keeping America safe. To me, that’s number one. We’ve made historic progress to crack down on visa overstays. You know all about that. They overstay for years. They say, “Maybe a night, maybe two nights.” Well, five years later, you catch them. No, we ended it. We issued strict sanctions on countries that failed to take back their own criminals. We have many countries beyond the four that I mentioned, the three plus one, many countries. They all take them back now. Before, they weren’t taking them back at all. The last administration simply released these criminals. We’re making sure they go home and we’re making sure they stay home. We don’t want them. We issued regulations to stop the horrible practice of birth tourism. You know what that is, right? Anchor babies, you know that, right? Anchor babies. Have a baby in our country and you stay for the rest of your life. Congratulations. You’re a citizen for 90 years. Then you bring in your family. You bring in your family, right? No. No good. I implemented a historic public charge regulation to finally and fully enforce the federal requirement that newcomers to our country must be financially self-sufficient, they cannot accept welfare for at least five years. To protect our country and our agents during the pandemic, my administration took immediate action to ensure the safe and rapid return of all illegal aliens. We brought them back. We have very few in our country now. We brought them back, can you believe it? To protect US workers, I suspended the entry of low wage workers that threatened all of your jobs, American jobs, and we’re finalizing the new H-1B regulations to permanently end the displacement of US workers. In January after the China virus, after the outbreak, after the outbreak, the China virus outbreak, it came from Wuhan, right? I swiftly implemented a travel ban on China and I was criticized. Biden, opposed the ban. He said, “I oppose the ban.” He had no idea what the hell he was doing. Why do you oppose it, Joe? I don’t know. They told me to say that. If we had listened to Sleepy Joe Biden, hundreds of thousands of additional American lives would have been lost. We did a good thing. That was in January, I imposed it, very early. A month later, Pelosi and all these people said, “Oh no, let people come in. We can’t.” We imposed it because China was heavily infected. Then I imposed it in Europe also, heavily infected with Italy and France and Spain. Compare our achievements with the insane and lethal policies that Biden and Bernie Sanders want. The entire Biden… Harris. How about her? Is she a great one? Is she? By the way, you talk about guns. She wants no 2nd Amendment. She wants to raise your taxes to a level you’ll be paying your government back for a long time. She is not the right pick, but she was my number one draft pick. They asked me that. Why do you think? I said, “I’m very happy.” They thought I was happy. They thought I was happy for him. No, I was happy for me. The Biden-Harris plan is a step by step recipe for abolishing America’s borders. In the Biden, Bernie manifesto, Joe Biden, promises to restore and expand catch and release across the entire US border. You believe that? We just got rid of it. Free all illegal aliens from federal detention and close detention facilities, this would make removing illegal aliens totally impossible, and you would have murderers, killers, rapists in your midst. I don’t think so. Immediately suspend all removals, triggering a tidal wave of, really a flood, if you think, a flood all across our border. End prosecution of illegal border crosses ensuring that illegal aliens will repeatedly reenter the country over and over again and terminate all protections we have enacted against asylum fraud. They want to do things that nobody thought was even possible to contemplate. Now, this is all simple and I really respect because so far I’ve only seen about four or five people go down. Because it is hot in here. But I will tell you this… It’s 120. You know what I said before? Think of yourself at a great spa, great sauna, where it’s 120 degrees and we have to pay a lot of money to be there. You have to pay a lot of money. Getting off the border, getting off illegal protection, all of that, we are going to lower your taxes further. We gave you the biggest tax decrease in the history of… The biggest tax decrease in the history of our country. We decreased your taxes more than anybody has ever done and we’re doing more because that’s going to spell growth and that’s what happened. Companies are moving in like nobody has seen before. So we’re doing that. Massive additional regulation cuts. We’ve cut regulations more than any president in the history of our country, whether it’s four years, eight years, or in one case, more. I told you already, our military is the best it’s ever been. It’s got $2.5 trillion worth of new, beautiful jets and equipment and rockets and everything. Hopefully, we never have to use it. Our nuclear arsenal, and hopefully, hopefully we never have to even look at it, our nuclear arsenal is at a level that it’s never ever been before, and we have to have it there, but we never want to use it. So we have done things not only on the border, the border is one element, and to me it’s very important. Something that they always say about a president, the most important thing a president can do is the appointment of federal judges and supreme court justices. So by the end of our, of not my, our first term, we will have appointed 300 federal judges and appeals court judges, and two supreme court justices. When it comes to 2nd Amendment, when it comes to life, when it comes to a lot of things that you people live for, if you don’t have the supreme court and if you don’t have the courts in your side, you can forget it. The next president, I think, will pick two, three, or even four justices of the supreme court. They can be on the court for 40 to 50 years. You pick them young. They could be on there for 40 to 50 years. This is going to be the most consequential presidency. This is going to be the most important, and I never thought I’d say it because of what happened four years ago, this is going to be the most important election of your life. So I just want to-Thank you. I just want to say stay healthy, stay sharp, be careful. Be very careful. Go out and work like hell. We need every single vote that we can get because it’s probably going to be close. I always assume it’s going to be close. They have these suppression, the fakers back there, they have the suppression polls where they interview many more Democrats than they do Republicans. Doug and I were talking about it and they take out registered voters. It’s not registered. They say, “Most likely to vote voters.” That’s what, most likely registered, they’re dead, they’re old, they’re not going to go, they’re not going to do anything. Be careful with your ballots, but get out there. November 3rd is the biggest date, one of the biggest dates in your life, in many cases, frankly, it’s the most important date of your life. One other thing we’ve done lot. We’ve gotten rid of a lot of nonsense from Obama, like the Paris Accord that costs us tens of billions of dollars and gave us nothing. We’ve gotten rid of so many different things that you have no idea, but you know what? If we don’t win, they can put it back, and with the things that we did put in, which are many, many, many things, many things, our military, our vets, everything, with all of the things that we put in, it’s like a tree, it takes a little while to grab on. You transplant it. It’s got to grab on. If we have four more years, there’s nothing that they can do. Our country is sailing. our country is sailing. So Yuma, thank you very much. Arizona, thank you very much. Thank you for all your support. We love you. We will never ever let you down. We will never let you down. Governor, thank you. Martha, go out and win. Go out and win. Vote McSally. Thank you everybody.

"39","08-19-20","Thank you very much. Before I provide an update on our continued progress against the China virus, I’d like to discuss our latest actions against the Iranian regime. Today, I’m directing the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to notify the UN Security Council that the United States intends to restore virtually all of the previously suspended United Nations sanctions on Iran. It’s a snapback. Not uncommon. Two years ago, I withdrew the United States from the disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal, which was a product of the Obama Biden foreign policy failure, a failure like few people have seen in terms of the amount of money we paid for absolutely nothing and a short term deal. This deal funneled tens of billions of dollars to around 150 billion to be exact, plus 1.8 billion in cash, which I don’t know that the president had the authority to give. Gave 1.8 billion in cash. Just another great deal that turned out to be a total disaster that would have funded all of the chaos and the bloodshed and the terror in the region and all throughout the world. And I won’t say anything because I don’t like saying it, but Iran doesn’t have so much money to give to the world anymore, to the terrorist, to give to Al Qaeda, various other groups of people that they were funding. They have to keep their own regime together and it’s not easy for them. And if, and when I win the election within the first month, Iran will come to us and they are going to be asking for a deal so quickly because they are doing very poorly, but that deal was a disaster. $150 billion. $1.8 billion in cash and we got nothing except the short term little deal. Short term, expiring and starting to expire already. It’s terminated but it would have, if we didn’t terminate it, start to expire very shortly. A good deal was the deal we made with UAE and Israel and by the way, other countries, I will tell you now, want to come into that deal. Countries that you wouldn’t even believe want to come into that deal and all of a sudden, you’re going to have peace in the Middle East and you couldn’t have done it with this ridiculous Iran Nuclear Deal, as they call it, that President Obama made along with sleepy Joe Biden. I imposed the toughest ever sanctions on Iran and this has caused great difficulty for them, giving money to terrorist organizations and if they do, they’ll have hell to pay. Earlier this year, I ordered the strike that took out the world’s number one terrorist Qasem Soleimani. In addition to previously terminating leader and founder of ISIS Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The two leading terrorists by far in the world. The founder of ISIS, nobody even talks about that. And we also defeated, we now have 100% of the ISIS caliphate in Syria. When I took over, it was a mess. It was a total mess. It was, they were all over the place. My administration will not allow this Iran nuclear situation to go on. They will never have a nuclear weapon. Iran will never have, mark it down. Mark it down. Iran will never have a nuclear weapon. When the United States entered into the Iran deal, it was clear that the United States would always have the right to restore the UN sanctions that will prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. We paid a fortune for a failed concept and a failed policy, a policy that would have made it impossible to have peace in the Middle East. Here at home, through Operation legend, we are confronting the wave of crime in Democrat run American cities, that’s absolutely shocking. When you look at Portland or New York, San Francisco, Seattle, Chicago, sometimes Los Angeles, Democrat run cities. They’re a mess because they don’t get it. Either they don’t get it or there’s something that nobody else understands. We’ve deployed more than 1,000 additional federal agents to help these Democrat run disasters. We just have done this. We have to give them a hand and we can stop it immediately. Like at Portland, would be so easy to stop. Would stop it immediately. We only sent in some Homeland people who are great, by the way, to save the courthouse, cause it would have been blown up or burned down and they did that very easily. But if we were called upon, we would send in, whether it’s Homeland, whether it’s FBI, whether it’s just law enforcement and we’d send them in quickly. We would eradicate it just like happened in Minneapolis. Soon as they were called in, they should have been called in a lot sooner. You would have had far less damage today. Today we announced that Operation legend has successfully resulted in nearly 1,500 arrests already. Bad ones. Bad ones. Really bad people. Prosecutions and prison sentences will follow and there’ll be very long time in prison for what they’ve done to these cities. Most cities are well run. Most of the nation as well run and the areas that we’re talking about are all, they’re all cases run by Democrats, usually radical left leaning Democrats like in New York or in Portland. We’ve made arrests in Kansas City, Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, Milwaukee, Saint Louis, Memphis and Albuquerque for many violent crimes, including gun crimes, arson and 91 murders. We’re also using the full power of the federal government to defeat, as you know, the China virus. New cases have declined in 80% of the jurisdictions in the past week; 80%. New Zealand, by the way, had a big outbreak and other countries that were held up to try and make us look not as good as we should look because we have done an incredible job, but they’re having a lot of outbreaks, but they’ll be able to put them out and we put them out. The hospitalization rate has fallen in our country. 54% since its peak in April; 54%. Older Americans are still the most vulnerable to the virus. 92% of deaths have occurred among those 55 and older. Only 2.7% of deaths have occurred among those 44 years. Think of that. 44 years and younger. So 44 years old and younger only 2.7% of deaths have occurred. And many of those people had preexisting conditions, had problems, heart, diabetes, and other problems, but many of those. So think of that. Only 2.7% under 44 years of age. Excess mortality in Europe this year is 33% higher than the United States. Evidence that the tragic cost of this virus is higher in other Western nations. South Korea. You’ve been reading about South Korea doing well, well, they just had a very big breakout, but they’ll be able to solve the problem. We must all remain vigilant and continue to exercise extreme caution around those at highest risk as we know. Multiple colleges and universities announced that they would suspend in-person teaching. We have learned one thing, there’s nothing like campus. There’s nothing like being with the teacher as opposed to being on a computer board. It’s been proven, a lot better. It’s a lot better. The iPads are wonderful, but you’re not going to learn the same way you do by being there. So nevertheless, certain colleges and universities have announced that they would suspend the in-person teaching. For older people and individuals with underlying conditions, the China virus is very dangerous, but for university students, the likelihood of severe illness is less than or equal to the risk of a seasonal flu. And the seasonal flu happens and comes and it goes, and it can be very bad, but people don’t talk about it in the same way and they shouldn’t. But if you look at that, the odds are less than or equal to. Instead of saving lives, the decision to close universities could cost lives. It is significantly safer for students to live with other young people than to go home and spread the virus to older Americans. Makes sense. And the shut down thing is causing tremendous depression for those places that are still shut down. You look at certain areas that, in all cases, Democrat run, still shut down. And their numbers there aren’t even good. But causing tremendous depression, suicide, drugs, alcohol, abuse. A lot of problems are being caused. Probably far more, I would say Scott, than is caused by the virus itself now that we understand the virus. Colleges should take reasonable precautions. Students who feel sick should not attend class and should limit social interaction as they would for any other illness. And universities should implement measures to protect the high risk students or professors and teachers. The ultimate goal of testing is to prevent transmission in high risk settings and to prevent transmission, period. But especially in nursing homes and to care for the vulnerable and our elderly, which really fit into that definition of who is vulnerable. We have tremendous unused testing capacity in our country. We have a tremendous unused testing capacity. It’s something that a lot of other nations are very impressed with, they tell us. In our path forward, we will continue to follow a science based approach to protecting the high risk while enabling healthy Americans to safely go back to work in school. Our country will be open. Our country is getting opened quickly. Our stock markets are almost back to where they were prior to the China virus disaster coming in. And I want to thank you all for being here and we’ll take some questions. Yes, please. Well, I don’t know much about the movement other than I understand they like me very much, which I appreciate. But I don’t know much about the movement. I have heard that it is gaining in popularity. And from what I’ve hear is these are people that when they watch the streets of Portland, when they watch what happened in New York city in just the last six or seven months, but this was starting even four years ago when I came here. Almost four years, can you believe it? These are people that don’t like seeing what’s going on in places like Portland and places like Chicago and New York and other cities and states. And I’ve heard these are people that love our country and they just don’t like seeing it. So I don’t know really anything about it other than they do supposedly like me. And they also would like to see problems in these areas, especially the areas that we’re talking about, go away. Because there’s no reason the Democrats can’t run a city. And if they can’t, we will send in all of the federal, whether it’s troops or law enforcement, whatever, they’d like. We’ll send them in. We’ll straighten out their problem in 24 hours or less. Well, I haven’t heard that. But is that supposed to be a bad thing or a good thing? I mean, if I can help save the world from problems, I’m willing to do it. I’m willing to put myself out there. And we are actually. We’re saving the world from a radical left philosophy that will destroy this country. And when this country is gone, the rest of the world would follow. The rest of the world would follow. That’s the importance of this country. And when you look at some of the things that these people are saying with defund the police and no borders, open borders, everybody just pour right into our country, no testing, no nothing. You talk about testing, no testing. Mexico as you know has a very high rate of infection. The wall is now going to be, next week, 300 miles long. Our numbers are extraordinary on the border. And this is through luck, perhaps more than talent, although the talent is getting it built when one party refuses to allow it. And you don’t hear talk about the wall anymore. But I will say this, we need strength in our country not weakness. Too much weakness. Yes. John. Well, I hear great things about it, John. That’s all I can tell you. And it could be a political decision because you have a lot of people over there that don’t want to rush things because they want to do it after November 3rd, and you’ve heard that one before, but I’ve heard fantastic things about Convalescent Plasma, and I’ve heard numbers way over 50 percent success and people are dying and we should have it approved if it’s good and I’m hearing its good. I heard from people at the FDA that it’s good, so we’ll see. I’m going to check that right after this conference. Well if the numbers are as good as I’m hearing. I’m hearing over 50 percent and that’s very good, and we’ve approved certain things that are 31 percent and that’s okay too. That’s not bad, and it’s really had a tremendous impact, but no I have… you’re telling me something right now that surprises me, but we’ll check it out right after this. I don’t want delays. I don’t want people dying. I don’t want people dying. Yeah, please go ahead. Yeah. Well I’m not happy with Goodyear because what they’re doing is playing politics and the funny thing is the people that work for Goodyear, I can guarantee you, I pole very well with all of those great workers in Goodyear, and when they say that you can’t have Blue Lives Matter, you can’t show a blue line, you can’t wear a MAGA hat, but you can have other things that are Marxist in nature, there’s something wrong with the top of Goodyear. And what the radical left does is they make it impossible for people to do business if they’re Republican or if they’re conservative, they put out all sorts of effort, don’t shop there. They do vicious things. Not so different than what you saw on the streets of Portland two nights ago. Oh, I don’t know that’s up to people, but I wouldn’t recommend it. If they want a whole political speech. If they want to let you not do what everybody’s doing. If they want to wear a MAGA hat, or if they want to wear a Blue Life, you know what Blue Lives Matter, right, that’s police men and women. That’s a terrible thing. That’s a terrible thing. They’re using their power over these people. And these people want to wear whatever it is that we’re talking about. You know that. And so I would be very much in favor of people don’t want to buy there, and you know what, they’ll be able to get a good job, because we set a jobs record over the last quarter as you know. The most jobs ever in the history of our country. You’ll be able to get another good job. I think it’s disgraceful that they did this. Please go ahead, in the back. Well I sent him best wishes. I hear he’s a wonderful gentleman, certainly a brave man and I send him best wishes. With that being said, because of that and obviously what happened in Hong Kong, we’ve taken all of the vast amounts of money that we use to subsidize Hong Kong, we essentially subsidize Hong Kong by giving them all sorts of incentives and that’s what made Hong Kong the exchange and business in Hong Kong successful. I’ve taken it all back. That means that the United States is going to do a lot more business. We really gave them tremendous incentive and subsidy in order that they be successful for freedom. But now that the freedom obviously seems to have been taken away, we will keep all of the incentives that we were giving them, which is billions, and billions of dollars, and all of that business will come into our country, including the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, and it’ll all come here. But I feel badly for him, because I hear he’s a good person. I don’t know him, but I hear he’s a good person, obviously a very brave person. Did you have something, go ahead. Say it? Well this is a man that I get along with very well. We’re largely out of Iraq, we down to very few soldiers I said. We’re getting out of these endless wars, these ridiculous endless wars. We should have never been there in the first place. I think it was the worst decision made in the history of our country. Should have never been there, in the Middle East we should have never been, but we’re getting out rapidly over the course of three years. And getting out, it’s very sticky getting out and some people agree, and many people don’t agree, but I think most people very much agree. We’re doing very well in our negotiations with Afghanistan with getting out. We’re down to a much smaller number of people left there and I greet men and women coming home and coming home after they’ve been hit. I’ve also greeted many, many at Dover, greeted many bodies coming back in and we’ve been there 19 years and we’re basically policemen. We’re acting as police as opposed to soldiers and they’re going to have to police their own states and they’ve been doing that for thousands of years. But it’s time after 19 years that our soldiers come home. They’ve done an incredible job, but they’re not allowed to fight to win and maybe they shouldn’t be because a lot of the people, it’s not their fault. But with the Taliban and with going to Iraq again, we’re down in Afghanistan, very low numbers and that’ll be taking place and I let them know, do anything and you’ll be hit like you’ve never been hit before. We’re doing very well. Syria the same thing. Remember when I took all of the soldiers off of the border between Syria and Turkey, right? And everybody said, “Oh, that was two years ago. That was a long time ago.” They said, “Oh, this is terrible, terrible, terrible.” We’re going to leave. Why do we have our soldiers between Syria and Turkey? Turkey can definitely take care of itself. I have a very good relationship with President Erdogan and Syria’s been fighting forever. And I say, “Why are we guarding their border?” And I brought our soldiers back home. I got them out, and guess what? Nothing’s happened. They’ve been fighting like they have been for a thousand years okay? Nothing’s happened. And nobody mentions that. Everybody said, “This is going to be a disaster.” There’s no disaster, nothing’s happened. We’re getting out of the endless wars and we are building a military the likes of which the world has never seen. Two and a half trillion dollars we’ve spent. And we hopefully don’t ever have to use it. But we want to focus on a much bigger picture, because we have a much bigger picture. It’s when you look at what China’s doing, when you look at what Russia’s doing, when you look at what some other countries are doing. We want to be ready just in case there is a catastrophe. We don’t want to see that. We don’t want to ever use it. We’ve rebuilt our military. New missiles, new rockets, and new tanks, and new everything. Two and a half trillion… all made in the USA and we’ve upgraded incredibly our nuclear capability and some of our nuclear needed nourishment, it needed new strength, and we’ve upgraded it very, very significantly. I mean to a level that nobody would even believe and hopefully we don’t, you pray to God, we never have to use it, okay? But we’ve never been in a position where we’ve been this strong, please. Yes. Having to do with UAE and Israel. I do. I think, look, they’ve definitely got the money to pay for it. It’s nice because usually what we, a lot of times we make deals they don’t have 25 cents, these countries we deal with. We give it to them like, “How about paying us back later?” But they never pay because they don’t have the money. Now they have the money and they would like to order quite a few F35s. It’s the greatest fighter jet in the world, as you know, by stealth, totally stealth. You can’t see. It makes it very difficult. I was asking a pilot, “What do you think is better? This one, this one, that one,” talking about Russian planes, Chinese planes. He said, “Well, the advantage we have is you can’t see it, so when we’re fighting, they can’t see us.” I say, “That sounds like a really big advantage to me,” to these guys. You know, they look, by the way, I said to these pilots that I meet, they look better than Tom Cruise, and they’re definitely tougher. He’s a nice guy, but these people are amazing and I speak to him a lot about it. What do you think, as I go around to the various places, I saved the big one in Florida as an example. That was a big one, knocked down pretty much by the hurricane. So, I spent a lot of time on that. And it’s the greatest plane in the world. One thing about that kind of thing, technology, high technology, greatest plane doesn’t last long if somebody comes up with something else, but we’re always the one to come up with something else. So yeah, they’d like to buy F35s, we’ll see what happens. It’s under review, but they made a great advance in peace in the Middle East, even the New York Times thought it was an incredible deal. Can you imagine that. Tom Friedman had a very nice thing to say about it. I spoke to him about it. He thought it was terrific and it is terrific. I see a lot of countries coming in fairly quickly and when you have them all in, ultimately Iran will come in too, there’ll be peace in the Middle East. That’ll be a nice. Iran will be very much neutralized. They never thought this could have happened. With the horrendously stupid Iran deal signed by Obama, this could have never happened. Yep. You're right. Yeah, I would do that. I would swap them out based on what I heard. We’ll see what happens. Look, you’re going to have a lot of people not wanting to buy that product anymore and they’ll buy from a competitor made in the USA too, okay? Please. When I listened to that, and then I see the horror that he’s left us, the stupidity of the transactions that he made, look what we’re doing. We have our great border wall, we have security, we have the UAE deal, which has been universally praised. Praised by people that aren’t exactly fans of Donald Trump for various reasons. I don’t know why, can’t be my personality, but they’re not fans. When I look at what we have. Now, look at how bad he was, how ineffective a president he was. He was so ineffective, so terrible, slowest growing recovery in the history, I guess since 1929, on the economy. Don’t forget until the China virus came in, we had the greatest economy in the history of the world, and now we’re doing it again. I’m going to have to do it a second time, we’re doing it again. Hard to believe we’re doing very well. You heard the numbers they’re way, way down on the virus. But when you look at the kind of numbers that we’re producing on the stock markets, we’re almost at the level, in fact, NASDAQ and S&P are higher than they were at the highest point prior to the China virus coming and the plague coming in. Now, president Obama did not do a good job and the reason I’m here is because of President Obama and Joe Biden, because if they did a good job, I wouldn’t be here and probably if they did a good job, I wouldn’t have even run. I would have been very happy. I enjoyed my previous life very much, but they did such a bad job that I stand before you as president. Thank you all very much.
















"
"40","08-20-20","Thank you very much. This is really great. We love this state. We won this state. I don’t know if you know what’s going on outside, but that’s … Right, Lou? That’s as many people as you can possibly have all the way back. How did you get in? That’s my question. I know you’re special friends of a group of people that have done a really good job, and I want to thank you very much for being here. But Pennsylvania has been very important to me. I went to school in Pennsylvania, as you know, college, and I love it. Please sit down. And by the time I finished, I’m going to have a nice sunburn right here. This is good. Where’s my sunblock? But I want to thank everybody. In 75 days, we’re going to win this state. We’re going to win four more years. They’ve had us under siege, and we beat them, and we beat them, and we keep beating them. But I’ll tell you, I’ve never seen anything … No president should have to go through what we’ve gone through. No president. Should never happen. And I watched President Obama last night, and I watched him talking about everything, and I had to put it out. I said, yeah, but he spied on our campaign, and he got caught. That’s about as bad a thing as you can imagine. If that happened to another campaign on the other side, they would have had 25 people in jail for many years already. Many, many years. It’s a disgrace. But in three years, and what we’ve done in just this short period of time, there’s been no administration that’s accomplished what we’ve accomplished, and that’s despite pandemics and despite all of the opposition and all of the witch hunts, the phony witch hunts. No administration has done what we’ve done. We’ve secured our borders, brought back our manufacturing jobs, rebuilt our military, wiped out the ISIS caliphate 100%, killed our terrorist enemies, achieved American energy independence, and guess what? We’re just getting started. That’s just a small part of it. That’s a small part of it. At stake in this election is the, and you know this, you know it, and I mean it, and I’ve never meant it more. At stake in this election is the survival of our nation. It’s true. Because we’re dealing with crazy people in the other side. They’ve gone totally stone cold crazy. You know, you look at Hillary. She was a lot smarter than Joe. But I’ll tell you, there was a certain sense of sanity four years ago. These people have gone insane, and they’re radical left, and you look at some of the things happening in these Democrat- run cities, which we could solve in two minutes. All they’d have to do is call us, right? Our great ex-congressman. All they have to do is … And thank you for being here. But all they have to do is call us. We’ll be in there in two minutes, and we’ll take care of the problem. Joe Biden is a puppet of the radical left movement that seeks to destroy the American way of life. They don’t understand, and probably when it happened, they’d say, what did we ever do? Joe Biden has pledged to hike your taxes by $4 trillion in the largest tax hike in history. And they’re going to waste the money on the Green New Deal, the Green New Deal. You know what you get out of that? Nothing. Nothing except debt and death. They want to eviscerate the Second Amendment. They want to take away your guns. They want to take away your guns. Well, you remember that, just that one point alone, and they want to take away your guns. So who’s going to vote for that? I mean, we want our Second Amendment. I’ve held it strong, and you think it was easy? I’ve held it totally strong. Give free healthcare to illegal aliens. You don’t get free healthcare? Expand deadly sanctuary cities. Force taxpayers to subsidize late-term abortion. Shut down the energy fields of Pennsylvania. They want to shut them down. No fossil fuels. No fossil fuel. Texas isn’t too happy, either. Go to Texas. I just left Texas a little while ago, two weeks. I said, they don’t want energy, they don’t want guns, and they don’t want religion. A guy stands up, says, “Not going to win Texas!” But you have the same thing, because you do a big, you’re a big fracking state. You want to see your taxes go up? Stop fracking. Doesn’t hurt you at all, fracking. They want to throw up windmills that are going to ruin your houses. Put up a big windmill. You walk out your door. You’ll see those big monsters churning. But even that they don’t want to do. I don’t think they want to do anything. I think they want to close your businesses. But just remember, Second Amendment. They’re going to take it away. As sure as you’re sitting or standing. They’re going to take it away from you. The Second Amendment. Don’t let it happen. Close down charter schools. Eliminate school choice. So important. Abolish the suburbs. They want to put low-income housing in the suburbs. So the American dream … And by the way, we have a lot of minority groups that live in the suburbs. African American, Asian American, Hispanic American, all did phenomenally last year with jobs. Best jobs we’ve ever had in the history of our country, the best economy we’ve ever had. But they’re a big part of the suburbs. And they want to put low income housing in the suburbs at a level that they’ve never done it before. And it’s been a very … Look, this has been going on for 20 years. I terminated the regulation that did that. They said, “Well, we can change that.” I said, “No, let’s terminate it.” People have to aspire to go there. They want to aspire to live in the suburbs. They want to abolish cash bail, releasing 400,000 criminals onto our streets. Think of no … No more cash bail. Look at what happened in New York. Cuomo ended cash bail. Cuomo. That wasn’t even DeBlasio that did it. It was Cuomo, the governor. He ended it in New York, and now the crime rate has gone through the roof. The speaker at Biden’s convention, proudly declared, we’re talking about abolishing the police. We’re talking about abolishing ICE, and we’re talking about abolishing prisons. And that’s, the only thing they’re not abolishing are taxes because your taxes are going to go up at a level that you’ve never even heard of before. If you want a vision of your life under Biden presidency, think of the smoldering ruins in Minneapolis, the violent anarchy of Portland, the bloodstained sidewalks of Chicago, and imagine the mayhem coming to your town and every single town in America. You’re not going to have law and order. Do you notice? And I shouldn’t say it because he’ll put it in his speech, if he can read it, which I doubt. But they’ll put it in there tonight. I shouldn’t say it because he’s going to speak later. He’s going to have a good audience. People are going to find out what the hell’s going on. I see he hasn’t answered a question since, they just said … Did you see it on the newscasts? Since July 17th. Hasn’t taken a question from the fake news back there. No, think of it. I take about a hundred questions a day. These people. It’s one thing I’ve learned, the people heading these other countries, whether it’s President Xi of China, Putin of Russia, Erdogan, Turkey, any of them, Kim Jong Un, North Korea. Remember we’re going to be in war with North Korea? Remember? It’s going to be a war? Right, congressman? There’s going to be a war. If Trump’s, oh, we’re going to have a war. No, it would have been a war if you had Hillary Clinton. Would’ve been a war if Obama were allowed to stay any longer. He thought there was going to be a war. Where’s the war? I don’t see the war. Maybe things happen. You don’t know. But there’s been no war. Nobody killed. He would have lost 25, 30 million people. They don’t say that. They say a hundred thousand people. No, no. Seoul is 32 million people, and it’s right next to the cannon fire. And we have a good relationship with him. I have a good relationship with him. You know, when I say that, isn’t that terrible? They say. No, it’s not terrible. It’s great. It’s great. I have a relationship. President Obama said when I sat down that first meeting, right? In the White House. He said it was the biggest problem we had. North Korea. And you would have had a big problem, would have been a hell of a war. Tell you right now. You’d probably be in that war right now. So when I say that we got along and we’ve met, everyone says, oh, that’s so terrible. No, it’s a good thing. It’s a good thing. Not a bad thing. It’s a good thing. Doesn’t mean bad things don’t happen, but it’s a good thing. There’s only one thing standing between your family and the radical left wing mob, and that’s your vote this November. This is a very important … I feel like I’m a wall. You know, we built the wall on the Southern border. We’re going to have 300 miles by two weeks from now, even less, 300 miles. And by the end of the year, we’ll be up to almost 500 miles, and then we’re going to go on a little bit further, some areas that are loose, a little bit loose. We found out. We’re going to put a little bit more, about 536 miles going up at a record clip. It’s doing phenomenally well. If you want mobs and criminals, you got to vote Democrat. Look, because that’s what it’s about. They don’t talk about law and order. Now, I’m bringing it up now, but they haven’t, I haven’t seen anybody get up … I got just the other day endorsed by all the sheriffs of Florida, all the law enforcement. I got endorsed by Pennsylvania. I got endorsed by Texas, by Ohio. I think everybody, I don’t know. How can you endorse somebody else? How could law enforcement endorse somebody else? We gave all of our ex-army equipment. We have tremendous surplus equipment, and it was sitting in warehouses all over the United States. Hundreds of millions of dollars, I distributed it to the police, whereas Biden and Obama, they didn’t want to do that because they said, no, no, no. It makes the police look too strong. I want the police to look strong. You got to look strong. And a lot of it was protective equipment. If you want jobs and you want a lot of police and you want a lack of crime, if you take away New York and Chicago and some of these terrible cities that you see about with the crime, the crime is so bad. I left New York four years ago, and I could see, because he’s a terrible mayor, I could see there were things that were happening that were bad. He’s no Rudy Giuliani, I can tell you that. But I could see things were happening. But the last six months, seven months, it just exploded. It’s incredible. Crime up 368%, 368%. It’s crazy. It’s crazy. But if you want law and order, and I can say it, sometimes they’ll say, sir, say it gently. People want to hear gentle. They don’t want, say it gently. Don’t say law and order. Say, if you’d like law and order and safety. Nah, I can’t do that. If you want law and order, you’ve got to have law and order. You can’t have what’s happening in Portland. Did you see the kid get whacked the other day? Just whacked, like he was a piece of garbage? I mean, who could take it? We don’t want that, and pretty soon we’re going to have to send in our people because we’re supposed to wait to request? Now, I don’t know if they’re embarrassed or what, but these Democrat cities, they’re out of control. They have none. Look at Seattle, where she said, no, we want a summer of love. I mean, this woman is crazy, and they would have never taken back Seattle except they knew we were going in the next day. That’s the only reason they even did it. So tonight we have slow Joe will speak at the Democrat Convention, and I’m sure that he’ll just knock them dead. And he’ll remind us that he was born in Scranton. But you know, he left like 70 years ago, right? He left a long time ago. He wasn’t one … I view it differently. He’d say he was born here, but he left when he was like eight, nine, or 10. So he left, 68 years ago, he left. Long time ago. So I view it differently. He wasn’t born here. He abandoned Scranton. Okay? His family had something to do with that. You know, his parents. But he loves Scranton. I mean, he keeps talking about, I was born in Scranton. I lived in Scranton. Yeah, for a few years, and then he left for another state. You know the state. But this Scranton stuff. That’s why I figured I’d come here and explain to you one thing. But I think you people know it better than I do. He left! He abandoned Pennsylvania. He abandoned Scranton. He was here for a short period of time and he didn’t even know it. And today it’s amazing. It goes around in a circle. He still doesn’t know it. But he spent the last half century in Washington selling out our country and ripping off our jobs and letting other countries steal our jobs, Mexico, China, all of them stealing our jobs. He’s been there for 47 years, and now he’s going to come in and make a change. I don’t think so. His son who walked out with $1.5 billion to manage. That’s billions of dollars a year, and the son didn’t even have a job before that. And I asked the Wall Street people, tell me, is that possible? Smartest people, top people on Wall Street. They say, can’t happen. It can’t happen. The smartest people, the people that do get money from every country, from everybody, they say can’t happen. He walked out of there in 10 minutes with $1.5 billion. You explain that one, right? And then if they want to look at him, nobody looks at him. Nobody looks at Ukraine. He gets 83,000 a month and a $3 million upfront payment because of his great expertise in energy. But he had none. And he even admitted, no, I don’t know anything about energy. But he goes onto an energy company. It’s millions of dollars, 83, it’s actually double that because it was him and some guy that knew less than he did. And is that okay? Yeah? Is it okay when Joe Biden goes and says, a billion dollars, you’re not getting it unless you get rid of those prosecutors. You talk about quid pro quo, right? That’s your quid pro quo. And they did, quid pro quo. Right? And they did, they got rid of the prosecutors. And then he’s called. He says, now you’re getting your money. Okay? Figure this. How about if that’s a Republican doing that, what happens to that republican? It’s over. It’s a disgrace. But it’s changing slowly, too slowly, as far as I’m concerned. Joe Biden is no friend of Pennsylvania. He’s actually, for the reasons we just said, he’s your worst nightmare. Biden supported every single globalist attack on Pennsylvania workers, NAFTA, China’s entry into the World Trade Organization, which built China into a power, TPP, Korea, the horrible, ridiculous Paris Climate Accord, which stripped our nation of its energy, and the so-called Clean Power Plan. The only good thing about it was the name. It was a horrible, unfair deal, horrible for you and horrible for Pennsylvania. They want to take your power away. You know what your power is? Your power is the billions of dollars you make in going deep into the earth and taking out what you have to take out. Everything you want, from fracking. You don’t realize how big a fracking state. Does anybody know how big fracking is? You’re not going to be allowed to frack anymore. You’re not going to be allowed. No oil, no nothing. No oil, no gas, no nothing. Just think of that. What would happen is, well, first of all, many of you, I guess 600,000, 670,000 lose their jobs. No money, no oil, higher taxes. Your stock market would crash. If they get in beyond fracking, if they get in, you’ll have your 401ks, which are setting records, by the way, stock market just hit a new high. And don’t forget, we’ve been going through this horrible plague from China. It just hit a new high. So think of that. It’s incredible. But your 401ks. How many people have 401ks here? Good. That’s a lot. That’s a lot. How about if they went down to like 10% of what they are now? Because that can happen. That can happen. And it will happen if we’re stupid and we don’t go out and vote and secure your ballot. Absentee ballots are good. But the stuff where they take millions and millions of ballots and send them all over the place, we’ll grab it and we’ll just put them in a big pile there. Everyone grab it. It’s a disgrace. Even common sense tells you that. Look at New York, look at what happened in New Jersey. Look at what happened in Virginia. Look at what happened. I won’t go through the details, you know the story. They have no control whatsoever. In New Jersey, 20% of the ballots were defective, fraudulent, 20%. And that’s because they did a good job. Okay? So this is just a way they’re trying to steal the election and everybody knows that. Because the only way they’re going to win is by a rigged election. I really believe that. I saw the crowd outside. For every sign we had for Trump Pence, every single sign. And that’s not that atypical in Texas. We had people on the highways, on the roadways, we’re driving to some oil well where we gave a speech. It was a 20 minute drive, between the plane and that oil well, there were tens of thousands of people and they had the signs, Trump and Trump Pence and flags, American flags. When the other side does show up, which is rarely, they never have an American flag. I can always tell if there’s a group of people. You never see an American flag. The fake news would tell you that. But you never see, but they don’t put it down, they’ll tell you that personally, but they won’t write it. But you never see an American flag. It’s an amazing thing. But if you look outside today, is it a hundred to one, 200 to one? And then you’ll read tomorrow that Biden was well-represented. He wasn’t well, there were hardly anybody there. Every once in a while, I’d see a Biden that’d be waving to the people. I’d see Biden, I’d say, “Wow.” I waved to her anyway. Who cares? But was it a hundred to one? It’s just massive. And you’ll read tomorrow that he had a massive crowd also. Pennsylvania lost more than one in three manufacturing jobs after NAFTA and China’s entry into the WTO. And that was a vote and courtesy of sleepy Joe. Biden looked American labor into the eyes and took care of dues, their union endorsements and their votes. The unions, I mean the unions have to be more reasonable. They have to be more reasonable. And we love the unions. We love non-union. I’ve had it all. I built every building I built in New York was with unions and unions are fine. A lot of Republicans don’t want me to say that, but I’ll tell you, unions are fine. Tell them to keep their dues down, please. But they’re fine. And you have unions here. You have non-unions. What I talk about is the worker. They treated our workers horribly. We lost our jobs to foreign lands. Our workers got fired, whether they were in the unions or not. Then he sold out and he passed the Cadillac tax. You know what that is, on union healthcare plans? Attack their energy jobs and sent their factories to China. And now he’s back begging for their votes. And it’s like a custom, Democrats. Except with me. I came in, I got so many union votes. I get far more. I mean, you’ve seen it. A couple of people either lost their job or came very close, that were unbeatable, because they let it charge for the Democrats for crooked Hillary last time. They let her charge. And the people in the union didn’t want that. They didn’t want Hillary, they wanted Trump. And we had union revolts, we call them. They revolted. But these guys right here, are you all union people? I can tell. Are you union? It’s good, right? It’s fine. That’s fine. Look at that. You got a hand. Certain parts of the country, they wouldn’t be as happy, but that’s okay, right? And it’s great. But they were not happy. And you know what was happening? They were not happy when the bosses got endorsed by the Democrats. American labor will vote for Trump Pence in 2020. They’re all saying that. And this area is going to be an incredible area. This used to be all Democrat until I came along. Until I came along, this was Democrat. This was heavily union. It was Democrat. It was everything. But they liked Trump and I’m going to never let you down and they will let you down. They will let you down. First of all, the country will be let down because the country, you will see a crash like you’ve never seen before. And as good as those stock market numbers are, there’s a headwind. They headwind is that if he won, the market’s going to crash. The Green New Deal, all of the different things, socialized medicine, that’s what they want. It’s socialized medicine. No doctor, no plan. Obama lied about it 28 times. Do you remember he said, “You can keep your doctor. You can keep your plan.” It wasn’t true. 28 different times, they have them. For the last four years, we’ve been reversing Biden’s betrayals and delivering historic wins. For the people of Pennsylvania, your state lost over 50,000 manufacturing jobs when Biden was vice president. In my first three years, Pennsylvania gained 14, 000 jobs, manufacturing, and going up at a level that nobody’s ever seen before. We’ll catch all of those jobs that were lost. They said manufacturing jobs will never come back. Remember, you need a magic wand. Where’s the magic wand? Well, we have the magic wand. My first week in office, I withdrew from the Trans-Pacific partnership. It would have been totally destructive to your jobs. It would have been a horror show. I withdrew from the one-sided Paris climate accord, which would have cost us so many billions of dollars. And all it would have done is made the competition even tougher all over the world. I believe it was designed to hurt the United States and to get jobs away from us and companies. I stood up to China’s rampant cheating, plunder, and theft. I repealed that horrible tax. So many taxes. How many taxes did I repeal? I’m getting a list of them now, I’ll have it for you for the next meeting. Because I’ll be back to Pennsylvania, that I promise. And I’m standing up to the special interests and to big pharma. Weeks ago, I signed four historic directives to dramatically reduce the cost of prescription drugs. Think of it. You know what I did? I signed, as you know and as you’ve seen, I guess, but other countries have sometimes 10% of what we pay for the same exact pill, same drug, same prescription drug. And I signed a deal that we get, it’s not signed by the drug companies, they hate it. They’ll take in advertising. Whenever you see bad ads on me from drug companies, just remember one thing, that means your prices are coming down. That means your prices. But it’s called Favored Nations, Favored Nations. We were the least favorite nation in the whole world. We paid the highest price. So I signed if Germany has an example, pays 25 cents for a pill and we pay $3 for the exact same pill, we pay 25 cents also. Now what means is they’re going to go up, we’re going to come way down. We could drop drug prices by 50, 60 or 70%, at a level that has made them very angry. And rebates too, I ended rebates. Rebates go to you. Nobody else would have done that. They could have done that a long time ago. Biden could have done it. He didn’t know what it meant. But I will tell you, most people do know what, but they can’t do it because big pharma is the most powerful group. And I guess they say, number one, is it number one, mister? But you didn’t take any money from big pharma, right? I bet you didn’t. I’ll bet you didn’t, my man. I ended the NAFTA disaster and I signed USMCA in Deloitte. USMCA is phenomenal. And it’s going to keep your companies from moving to Mexico and other places. After years of building up other nations, we’re finally building up our nation and we are finally doing something that I’ve been talking about for years. We’re finally putting America first, and I’ve done that right from the beginning. We’re honored to be joined today by some incredible warriors that were really fantastic to me and friends of mine, but they really fight. These Pennsylvania people are fighters, in case you haven’t noticed. Representative Scott Perry. Scott, where’s Scott? Thank you, Scott. Great job, Scott. The warriors. Lloyd Smucker. Lloyd, thank you. Thank you, Lloyd. John Joyce. John, thank you. Great job. Great job. And a friend of mine and a great, great man. He would have been here forever if he decided to, but he decided maybe it was time to do something else. But this was a fighter like no other fighter. And those three other gentlemen will attest, right? Our friend Lou Barletta. Lou. And they’re shouting. I’m saying this for the media. They’re shouting “Lou”, they’re not booing. They’ll say, “He stood up and he got booed horribly. It was a horrible embarrassing.” No, that’s what they do. They’re fake. Thanks also to our congressional candidates, Jim Bognet. Jim, oh, look at him. I’ve heard good things, Jim. Is it easy out there on the stump? Good, good. And you’re going to win, Jim. You’re going to win. And Lisa Scheller. Lisa, thank you very much. Great job. I hear you too are doing really good. If you have any problems, call Lou, he’ll help you. Let me also thank my campaign state chairwoman, Bernie Comfort. Where are you? Thank you very much Bernie. Thank you, Bernie. Great job you’re doing. How are we doing in Pennsylvania? Okay? I think so. I think so. If we don’t, they did a lot of manipulation. Also, a friend of mine for a long time and a great friend of his father and maybe his grandfather. I don’t even know. I hate to say that because it makes me sound a little bit older than I feel. I feel young. State GOP Chairman, Lawrence Tabas. What a great family. I miss Dan Tabas. You know that? Dan Tabas, what a great man he was. I don’t know if you know him, but he started out with about 2 cents and he ended up being a rich man. And he employed a lot of people and he was a real friend of mine. That was long before I ran for politics. He didn’t like many people, but he liked Trump. Right? People would go, “He’s a rough guy.” People would go up to him and say, “Hi, Dan. How you doing?” He became a very successful guy. And he’d look out and say, “I don’t want to talk to anybody. I just want to talk to Trump.” I like that kind of a guy, right? But he was a fantastic man, actually. He was a good man. Before the China virus invaded our shores, we built the greatest economy in history, nothing even close. We added seven million jobs nationwide, including 209,000 new jobs in Pennsylvania. By the way, in the last three months, right Bernie? Over nine million jobs, an all time record. This is now during and hopefully closing moments of the pandemic. You notice how they, anytime there’s a good country, they like to compare, because we’ve done an incredible job. You look at our mortality rates, you look at all the things. But they like to compare us to others. So they were talking about New Zealand. New Zealand, it’s over, it’s over for Zealand. Everything’s gone. They’re beautiful. They had a massive breakout yesterday. South Korea, it’s over, it’s over. Big breakout yesterday. It’s a tough deal. We’ve done a great job. We’re a big, big country. And maybe this is popular to say, maybe it’s not, I don’t care. Because based on the crowd outside, it looks to me like we’re going to win this thing. I think, by the way, by a lot. But your governor has you on a shut down like, what’s going on? How did they all get out there? And they were not socially distanced, I can tell you. We’ll have to. On the way back, they’ll still be there because they’re incredible people. But what is he doing? He’s got you in a shutdown, still. Shut down wolf. He can’t do this. He’s going to destroy your soul. What happens is depression, anxiety problems with family members, drugs, heart attacks, obesity. I mean, what is he doing? It’s more dangerous than the virus. He’s got to open this state up. You know when he’s going to open it up? No, I know what he’s doing. Because a lot of them are doing it, doing it in the great State of North Carolina, right? They’re doing it in North Carolina. But they’re doing it in a lot of different areas. They’ve got to open this state up and you have to do it, right? This wonderful, incredible Commonwealth. Right? I would call it a Commonwealth. Do you ever mind of they call it a state? No, call it Commonwealth. Whatever the hell you want to open it up. And what is he doing? What is he doing? So the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, we’re going to get it open. And I know when he’s going to do it. You know when it is? November 4th. November 4th, he’s going to say, “Well, we’re going to open it up.” Then your results are no better than other states, by the way. It’s not like, “Oh gee, this is great.” Michigan has it closed down and North Carolina has a closed down, and this Commonwealth has a closed down. It’s a very sad thing to see. And the results are not good. The results, it’s not like, “Oh, this is wonderful.” The results in some of these places, as worse than those that are open. And you have other states. I mean, you look at the country, it’s really, we have states we’re thriving, we’re thriving. And there’s no shutdown. It’s enough. We shut it down because we had to, we didn’t know anything about what was happening. We shut it down. We learned a lot. Protect our seniors, et cetera, et cetera. You’ve all heard it. We learned a lot, protect our seniors, et cetera, et cetera. You’ve all heard it. But we learned a lot. Then we opened it up and now we have a big V. Remember they said the V will never happen? We have a big beautiful V. We enacted the largest financial relief package in American history. And through the Paycheck Protection Program, we saved nearly two million Pennsylvania jobs. We’ve also delivered nearly … That’s right. Two million jobs. We delivered nearly $11 billion in direct support to Pennsylvania families. And over the past three months, we’ve gained over nine million jobs. Nobody could even believe the numbers. And watch. The numbers will get better and better because we’re opening up. And frankly, the Democrats should do it. They should do what’s right for the country. They know they should open. Wolf knows he should open. He knows that. And how about his person with her mother, right? With her mother? Where the mother was protected, but the other people weren’t. You had a massive number of deaths in nursing homes, but 95 year old mother as I read. And I said, “Well, that person will be gone very quickly.” And that person is still there. I would say that’s something that if somebody ever wants to run for the governor of Pennsylvania, that would be something good to use. So they took the mother out of harm’s way and then moved her back when everything was okay. And nobody says anything about it? There’s no firing? Retail spending is now at an all time high. Who would have believed that? Auto production has gained 28%. Biden would terminate this unprecedented recovery. He wants to impose a permanent lockdown combined with a socialist takeover of the US economy. Did you hear him the other day? Lock it down. He wants to lock it down. So everything that we’ve gained over the last number of months, he wants to lock it down. No, we’re doing good. Florida’s going down substantially. Arizona, done a great job in Arizona. Texas going down. California is going down. They’d opened these states up and everybody wants to practice good hygiene. All of the different things. Do the masks. I mean, it’s just not going to hurt. Do them. Do them. You feel it, do them. But these things, these places have to be opened up. But November 4th, you’ll open. Don’t worry about it. But that’s a long time from now if you think about it, right? That’s a long time for now. In Biden’s policy manifesto written with socialist Bernie Sanders, Biden pledges to quickly outlaw American oil. He’s going to outlaw American oil, coal, American coal. He’s going to outlaw it. Natural gas, which is really an amazing form of energy, it clean, by mandating net zero carbon emissions from all homes and buildings within nine years and from all power plants by 2035. So he wants to basically get rid of all fossil fuels. And you know, I know everything about energy. I know so much about energy. Our new forms of alternative energy just aren’t powerful enough to power these massive plants and all of the things that are creating all of these jobs and all of this wealth for your state and for the country. This week in California, there were rolling blackouts because the radical Democrats have mandated impossible restrictions on energy production. And I see again, the forest fires are starting. They’re starting again in California. I said, “You got to clean your floors. You got to clean your forests.” They have many, many years of leaves and broken trees. And they’re like, so flammable. You touch them and it goes up. I’ve been telling them this now for three years, but they don’t want to listen. The environment, the environment. But they have massive fires again in California. Maybe we’re just going to have to make them pay for it because they don’t listen to us. We say, “You got to get rid of the leaves. You got to get rid of the debris. You got to get rid of the fallen trees.” You know when a tree falls, after 13 to 14 months, it becomes extremely dry. You look at some of these fires, they don’t really catch where the trees are growing because they’re wet. The water’s pouring up the tree. And they just don’t want to listen. They mocked us when I said that you got to clean your floors, just an expression. Clean the floors. And they have many, many years, decades of leaves, dry leaves. And that’s why they have it. There are other places, forest cities, they’re forests, they were developed in forests and they don’t have any problem, with more flammable trees than you have in California, but they just don’t want to do it. Senior citizens were forced to sit in their homes with no air conditioning in the middle of the summer and Biden wants to eliminate power plants all across America. You had a problem over here. But think of that, if they do that, get used to no air conditioning. They probably don’t want that either. Under my administration, we ended the war on American energy and I put the miners back to work. We put them back to work. The miners are back to work now. I approved the Keystone XL and the Dakota Access Pipelines almost right at the beginning. I just approved them right at the beginning and a lot of jobs. And by the way, it’s a much cleaner form of transportation. America is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world. Think of that one. To protect our great steelworkers … Do you have a couple of … Any steelworkers here by the way? To protect our great steelworkers, I placed tariffs on nations that were dumping cheap, foreign steel all over the place. And we have created an incredible industry out of nothing. It was ready to go out. Within months, steel imports dropped by 26% and American steel production surged by 18 million tons, almost immediately. Biden abandoned the steel industry and saved other industries that were worthless, but he didn’t save the steel industry. We saved the steel industry. You wouldn’t have a steel industry right now. When Joe Biden was vice president, the border was an open pipeline for criminals, gang members and cartels, flooding our schools with drugs. Under my administration, we ended the catch and release, horrible catch and release. You catch the criminal. You take their name. You say, “Is this right?” “We don’t have identification.” “Oh, that’s okay.” It’s like voting. They don’t want to have voter ID. Why? There’s only one reason the Democrats don’t want voter ID. You have ID for almost everything. You have your picture, everything nice, but not on a vote. Most important thing you can do is to vote. And voter ID, but they don’t want it. There’s only one reason they don’t want voter ID. And you know what that is, right? That’s really better. You guys all in favor, by the way, of voter ID? Everybody? If they weren’t, they wouldn’t be congressmen in good standing for very long. I’ll tell you that. We stopped asylum fraud and we deported 20,000 gang members and 423,000 criminal aliens. We got them the hell out of our country. But if Biden is elected, all of this security will quickly vanish. Control of the border will be seceded to violent cartels and the left wing crazies who empower them. And you used to see these massive amounts of illegals coming up from Honduras, from Guatemala, El Salvador. They’d come up and it’d be just thousands of them. You don’t see that anymore. Mexico is putting … They have right now. They have for months, 27,000 of their soldiers on our Southern border. You got to do it. You got to do it. Mexico has been really working with us very well. I have to tell you the new president of Mexico, now he’s not so new. He’s been there a little while. But the president of Mexico has done a great job as far as I’m concerned, from the standpoint of our relationship and our relationship with Mexico. In his joint manifesto with Bernie Sanders, Biden just called for a complete suspension of deportations, closing down detention facilities, ending border prosecutions. Think of this. Restoring and expanding catch and release, handing out free welfare to new arrivals, work permits for illegal crossers, and mass amnesty for all illegal aliens. Can you believe this? This is Bernie plus … I feel like Biden would be taken right. This is to show you how good a negotiate he is. Bernie took him left. It’s supposed to start and they’re supposed to meet a little bit left of center maybe, for them. For us it’s right of center. But Bernie actually took him left along with AOC plus three, right? AOC plus-It’s another beauty. She’s the designer of the Green New Deal. She knows nothing about the environment. She probably never studied … Ask her. How many hours have you taken on the environment? Biden wants to open your borders in the middle of the pandemic. Thank goodness we have that 300 miles of wall because you would have had a problem like you never would’ve seen before. I want strong borders and I want safe communities. If we don’t have borders … I was saying this from day one. If we don’t have borders, we don’t have a country. I imposed a travel ban on jihadist regions to keep terrorists out of our country. And it worked. And it got approved and the press said he failed. And they were right. The lower court failed. Your appeals court failed. And I won at the Supreme court. So they still say it failed because I lost it the first two courts. That’s how dishonest they are. They say he lost because I lost in the first two courts, but we won at the Supreme court. They forget to mention that fact. Joe Biden has pledged to remove this ban, opening the flood gates to terror and terror hotspots, and increasing the number of refugees allowed into our country by 700%. That’s the manifesto of AOC and Bernie. Joe Biden and Kamala. She’s another beauty. Also strongly support the deadly sanctuary cities that have been so bad for you and everybody else’s. District Attorney in San Francisco, Kamala put a drug dealing illegal alien into a job and jobs program instead of into prison. Four months later, the illegal alien robbed a 29 year old woman, mowed her down with an SUV, fracturing her skull and ruining her life. We believe our country should be a sanctuary for law abiding Americans, not for criminal aliens. After eight long years, Joe Biden and Barack Obama left America weak, disrespected, and endangered. We are respected again. We are a respected country again. They said that one of the leaders called up, top top leader of one of the countries. He asked me to call President Erdogan of Turkey, who I get along with very well. He said, “Sir, please, would you do me a favor? Call Erdogan.” I said, “Why can’t you do it?” He says, “You’re the only one he respects. You’re the only person he respects.” I tell you this story. I like telling very personal stories. But they did say that. “You’re the only one he’ll listen to.” I said, “Is that because of the United States?” They said, “No, it’s because of you.” So that’s not so bad. I might as well. I might as well tell you the stories because they won’t. We’ve invested more than $2 trillion to rebuild our military. Our military is in the best shape it’s ever been and everything is made in the USA. And we revived the historic shipyard in a place called Philadelphia with hundreds and hundreds of new jobs. You know that. And we’ve just launched Space Force. I never talked about it on the campaign trail. Lou, right? I never talked about it. I’m the only one probably that ever ran for office in this country that’s achieved more than I said I would. I never talked about Space Force. I never talked about it. But I realized how important it was and we got it. A sixth branch. Think of that. Sixth branch. That’s a big deal. American rockets are once again sending American astronauts into space. We renewed NASA. It was a field of weeds. A field of weeds. President Obama closed it down. We’re not sending rockets up. And a lot of those rockets are paid by rich people. They like sending up rockets for whatever reason. They like it. I say, go ahead. You can pay us a little rent and you can use our property. We withdrew from the disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal, a horror show. The ISIS caliphate was destroyed. The founder and leader of ISIS, the animal known as Al- Baghdadi is dead. The world’s number one terrorist, Qasem Soleimani, is dead. Joe Biden voted for the war in Iraq. I kept us out of new wars. Everyone said, “Oh, Trump, it’s his … He’ll be in a war his first week.” Instead of that, I got you out of wars. We’re down to a minimum number in Iraq. Afghanistan will be down very shortly to 4,000 troops and that’ll come back shortly too. Syria, we took them all out other than where we kept the oil if that’s okay with you. We kept the oil. We have some back and keeping the oil. We should have kept the oil in Iraq too. Remember, I used to say, “Keep the oil. Don’t go in.” I’d say, “Don’t go into Iraq.” But I was a civilian. Nobody cared. I was like you. So nobody cares. I want to get that mosquito out of here. I don’t like … They’ll say it’s cruelty to animals. I don’t know. No, it’s true. They were saying the other night, the shark. They were saying, “Oh, sharks. We have to protect them.” I said, “Wait a minute. Wait.” They actually want to remove all the seals in order to save the shark. I said, “Wait, don’t you have it the other way around?” That’s true. I’m not a big fan of sharks either. I don’t know how many votes am I going to lose? I have people calling me up, “Sir, we have a fund to save the shark. It’s called Save the Shark.” I say, “No thank you. I have other things I can contribute to.” I recognized Israel’s true capital, opened the American embassy in Jerusalem, and recognized Israel and its sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Nobody else. They talked about it for years. For years and years, many, many presidents talked about the capital of Israel, Jerusalem. And they never did it. I did it. And Golan Heights, 52 years, they’ve been meeting on Golan Heights. I did it. Last week we reached a historic breakthrough in the Middle East, finalizing a groundbreaking agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates. People can’t even believe it. Even the New York Times gave us a great editorial. They can’t even believe it. We passed veterans choice and veterans accountability for our great vets. Nobody’s done for the vets what I have. Nobody. Not even close. We love the vets. And federal workers who failed and mistreated our veterans now can be told, “You’re fired.” That’s accountability. We couldn’t fire them. We had sadists. We had thieves. We had some bad people. They let go of 9,000 people in the VA. They were bad people. They didn’t love our vets. Now they have to love our vets. In a second term in office we will create 10 million jobs in the next year. We will hire more police. We will ban sanctuary cities. We will appoint prosecutors, judges, and justices who believe in the rule of law, not the rule of that horrible mob that you get to watch on television. We will provide school choice in every home. We’re going to let you have school choice. That’s a very important thing. The Democrats don’t want anything to do with school choice. We will lower the price of prescription drugs as I said. We will build and expand our energy infrastructure to a level that is even greater than what we have right now, and when I said before we’re number one, we’re number one by a lot, nobody thought we’d ever be number one. And we are energy independent, which is very nice. As we’ve been doing, we will end our reliance on China and other countries for drugs and other things. We will make our critical drugs, medicines, and supplies, here in the United States. We will give tax credits to companies to bring jobs back to America, and if they don’t do it, we’ll put tariffs on those companies, and they’ll have to pay us a lot of money. So what are they going to do? They’re going to bring the jobs back. In every action, every moment, and every decision I’m fighting for you. I’m fighting for Pennsylvania. A lot of people got rich and got powerful at your expense. Now these same liberal hypocrites want to open up borders and let violent mobs rule the streets while they live in Waldorf compounds in communities. They want to defund police while hiring private security. They want to let rioters burn churches while jailing you for praying in your church. They want to abolish school choice while sending their children to the best private schools in the land. They want to cancel you. Totally cancel you. Take your job, turn your family against you for speaking your mind, while they indoctrinate your children with twisted, twisted, worldviews that nobody ever thought possible. You notice they’re not knocking down statues and monuments anymore because when I saw what was happening I took an old law and I signed a nice new executive order. Then I explained, “10 years, if you knock down a statue, federal statue, or monument.” They were all set to March on Washington. “We’re going to knock down some nice statues,” and then they said, “You know what? Let’s not march.” The march ended very quickly. There was no more marching. They said, “You know, 10 years that’s a long time.” That’s a long time to knock over a statue that many people love and many people don’t. There’s a way of getting it down. You do it through a legal process. It’ll go quickly if it’s right. Joe Biden is the candidate of these privileged liberal hypocrites who hold you and your values in disdain. But you can send them all a thundering message on election day by voting for Trump-Pence. Do we love our vice president too? Do we love our vice president? I’ll tell you, I watched Kamala last night and I said, “I’ll take Mike.” I’ll take Mike by a lot. He’s been a great vice president actually. Pennsylvania is the state that gave us the Declaration of Independence, Valley Forge, Gettysburg, and generations of American patriots. Just like you. You’re patriots. You love this country. That’s why you’re here. You’re sitting in this boiling, crazy hot, sun. But you’re smarter than me because with you it’s on the back of your head. With me, I’m going to go home and my wife is going to say, “What happened? You look like a lobster.” Look the sun. This is great. I want to look like Lou, nice and dark. Right Lou? But with Lou it’s a little easier I think. This is the state where workers got their hands dirty mining the coal and forging the steel that raised up the mightiest nation in the history of the world. We’re going to be stronger than ever before. Remember that. We are already. We are going to be stronger than ever before, and that’s happening right now. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and you know this. Look, together we’re taking back our country. But I was just thinking as I said “stronger”, they want to come in and raise your taxes. They want to come in and put regulations on all of your factories, and all of your jobs, and all of your personal things. You know, little things, and they laugh at it when I say it. The light bulb. Those new expensive light bulbs. I said, “What happened to the old ones? They’re better.” They said, “They were mandated out.” I said, “Why?” Nobody could explain why. I said, ” We’re letting them back. The light bulbs are back.” Dishwashers. They have dishwashers they don’t give you any water. They give you not enough water, so they’re lousy. So what do people do? They press the button again, and again. No water. I let them have lots of water. We just got back from Whirlpool in Ohio. They’re thriving now because of what I did to competition from other countries. I tariffed them, and Whirlpool now went from a company that was just about over to a company that’s thriving. Sink faucets, shower faucets. I won’t say the third element of the bathroom because they always just bring that up, so I won’t say that but you know what I’m talking about. They don’t allow water. You go into a new hotel. You turn on the water. There’s no water. I opened it up. I said they could have as much water. I mean does Pennsylvania have a problem with water? No. Yeah you have a problem with water. You have too much of it. Right? You have too much water. You got to get rid of it. So why are we having restrictors? They have restrictors on, so I took it off. These are little things. I tell you about them. A lot of people appreciate them. A lot of people don’t know about it. But now you could go out, buy a light bulb for a tiny fraction of the cost that’s better. Won’t last as long, but it’s better. It’s better light. Makes me look much better. That’s a very important, it’s a very important thing. But you can buy now faucets where water actually comes out, and so instead of having it like on for many times longer … Actually when I take a shower, I can have water hit my hair instead of drop, drop. It’s hard enough my hair without that. So now we can actually have water pouring out of our shower heads. Okay? So a lot of good things. We’ve done a lot of things that nobody talks about, nobody writes about, but it’s about quality of life, and I think the people really appreciate it. I really do. Not so easy to do. Not so easy to do. I don’t think anybody else could have done it. Nobody else would have thought to do things like that, but nobody else would have done it. We’re returning power to you the American people from Scranton to Easton. How’s Ernie doing? Good? Huh? How good is Ernie? Right? Right? Is he great? Ernie Holmes? He was heavyweight champ. Right? The champ. Larry. Larry. Sorry about that. I know another one named Ernie Holmes. Larry Holmes. Is he still in the area of-How good was Larry? Right? That was probably Muhammad Ali’s most dangerous fight. I’ve never seen anything like it. Mohammad would never go down, but Larry Holmes was a great champion and I know he loved Easton. He used to tell me that, “I want to invest my money in Easton.” I don’t know if that was a good thing or a bad thing. I hope he’s doing well, but he was one hell of a fighter. From Scranton to Easton, to Allentown, we’re going to fight for every job, every family, every neighborhood, and every vote. Together we’ll unite citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed, as one people, one family, one glorious nation under God. That’s another word they don’t want you to say, God. You know that, right? Did you see they were doing something last night that was extremely basic, and always has had the word God in it, and they decided to take the word God out. But this is where they’re coming from. They’re coming to get you. This is where they’re coming from. And me, we, we’re the wall between the American dream and total insanity, and the destruction of the greatest country in the history of the world. We’re all that stands. We’re all that stands, and a typical Republican probably wouldn’t get there but I think I’m very Republican in many ways, but your typical Republican would not be able to win. Like your area. This has always been a Democrat area, and yet the votes for Trump here are through the roof. You know how successful we were four years ago. Incredible. It’s a great area. These are great people. They’re great, hardworking, incredible people, and we love them. With your drive and devotion we will win a historic victory on November 3rd, and we will make America greater than it’s ever been before. I just want to thank the people of Scranton, the lack of home, okay, the lack of home for Joe Biden. Remember the next time. We’ve got to stop him from saying these things. But you look at … He’s going to make a speech tonight. It’s going to be very interesting to see how he does, and I hope he does well. I’ll be honest. I do. I hope he does well. I really hope he does well, but I also want him to tell the truth. He’s got to tell the truth about things, and he’s going to do a lot better if he does, but hopefully not well enough. Right now we are leading a war that’s incredible. But right now we’re leading in so many polls that they refuse to put out. We’re doing so good in this state, in North Carolina, in Florida, in Texas, in Ohio, in Michigan. You know how many car plants are being built or expanded in Michigan? We’re doing fantastically in Michigan. We’re doing great in New Hampshire. These are real polls. These aren’t suppression polls. These aren’t polls where they do registered voters. Registered. No. You want to do voters that are going to vote. Registered voters. You want to do what’s called likely voters. Likely. In other words, people that are likely to vote. Not registered voters, many of whom have died, many of whom aren’t going to vote, and then you want to do an even count. You don’t want to do many more Democrats. They do a poll. Right? Many, many Democrats, few, few Republicans. Trump is down by six, and then you look and you say, “Well, if that poll is true, we’re up by 10.” So we’re going to see. You’re going to see. They did it last time. They had me losing every swing state. I think they had me losing like nine states that I won. But he’s going to lose. Right? You were the first one that told me Lou. He’s going to lose seven swing states. He’s going to lose them all. He’s down by 14. Washington Post-ABC, they had me down one week before the election 12 to 14 points. The day of the election, because we complained that it was a fake poll, so they changed it the day of the election, and they had us just about even. Remember that whole big deal? We said, “You can’t say we’re down because that’s called suppression.” Then you say, “Hey, I love Trump, but I can’t vote for him because I don’t have the time because he’s not going to win.” But if you would have gone out and voted, we would have won. The problem was last time for them, 2016, everybody went out and voted. There was no suppression. There was incredible exhilaration except on the other side that they would not … You ever see those pictures of the craziness going on? But the polls were fake. Just like their stories are fake. Just like the news is fake. The polls are even worse, and we’re now actually doing worse. One of the most accurate polls was Rasmussen, and Rasmussen came out today. Did you see it? 51 for Trump, 51. I think they were one of the three most accurate polls and the ones that are telling the truth. Sometimes, I mean they have a poll that came out recently that was very favorable, they refused to release it. They didn’t want the people to see it. What kind of stuff is this? That’s why you’re going to do a great job. Right? You’re going to make sure this stuff doesn’t happen, but we’re going to make sure too. So we’re going to win this, and I think we’re going to win it really big. When you see those people outside, and I mean you can take this crowd and multiply it times a hundred, but when you see this crowd, and when you see the kind of enthusiasm, there’s nothing like it. We’re leading by the way, even they admit, we’re leading by enthusiasm by numbers like they’ve never seen before, record numbers. Meaning we have record enthusiasm, and he has a record lack of enthusiasm, and that is a big, big factor. So I just want to thank all of the people from this incredible place. I mean it’s just a great, a great, great place. I’ve been here for so long and so much, and I love it, and I love the people. We’re going to have the biggest victory. We’re going to have a victory that will equal or surpass what we did in 2016. Thank you all very much. Thank you very much. Thank you.

"41","08-21-20","Wow. You’re really fantastic and I want to thank you very much. You really are. Thank you very much. And thank you, Bill. And thank you to the Council for National Policy. My brother, Robert would have wanted me to be here today. Thank you very much. Together we’re committed to protecting the American people, preserving American values, defending America’s heritage and keeping America safe, strong, prosperous, and free. I want to thank Bob McEwen, Kelly Shackelford and Jenny Beth Martin, for your tremendous leadership of the CNP, done a fantastic job. We’re also joined by acting secretary of Homeland Security, who’s done incredibly, Chad Wolf, where is Chad? Thank you very much, Chad. You’re right in the heart of it and got some big things coming, very big things. Good job. Also, Lieutenant Governor, friend of mine, Dan Patrick of Texas, Dan. Dan, wherever you may be. What a great guy, great family, great son, doing a tremendous job as US attorney. And many other state and local officials, I want to thank you all for being here, we have a lot of horsepower here, a lot of firepower you might want to say. But over the last week, the Democrats held the darkest and angriest and gloomiest convention in American history. They spent four straight days attacking America as racist and a horrible country that must be redeemed. Joe Biden grimly declared a season of American darkness and yet look at what we’ve accomplished until the plague came in, look at what we’ve accomplished. And now we’re doing it again. It’s most successful period of time in the history of our country, from every standard, look what we’ve accomplished. And now this plague comes in and look at the way they talk. But look at what’s happening and look at how we’re shooting up. We call it a super V, it’s no longer a V, it’s a super V and they didn’t think that could happen and they’re probably not happy about it. They want to punish America and its citizens instead of holding them high, where Joe Biden sees American darkness, I see American greatness. We’ve seen heroic doctors and nurses racing into action to save lives. We’ve seen first responders helping strangers in need. We’ve seen the passage of historic legislation to save 50 million American jobs. We’ve mobilized American industry like never before. We’ve built military hospitals from scratch, produced life saving therapies, and we’re on track to develop the most incredible from a standpoint of time, record time, vaccines. We have vaccines. You’ll be reading about them very soon, way, way ahead of schedule, years ahead of schedule. This would have been where we are now, Phase 3 trials, clinical trials, you wouldn’t have been there in two or three years if you went back to another administration. It’s time to reject the anger and the hate of the Democrat Party, we have the biggest election coming up of our lifetime. No party can lead America that spends much time tearing down America. But the biggest part of last night’s speech was what Joe Biden didn’t talk about. He didn’t talk about law enforcement, he didn’t talk about bringing safety to Democrat run cities that are totally out of control and they have no clue. China was never mentioned in any way, shape or form. China will own our country if he gets elected, they will own our country. And we’re not going to let that happen. And you’ve seen the intelligence reports, China very much wants Joe Biden to win. That would be very insulting if they wanted me to win. I don’t think so. I don’t think so. We’ve taken in billions and billions of dollars from China. We’ve given it to our farmers. We’ve given it to a lot. They had the worst year they’ve had in 67 years, we had the best year we’ve ever had. We’ve demonstrated over the last four years the extraordinary gains that are possible while we stand strong for our beliefs, when we trust the wisdom of our founders and when we embrace America’s destiny, it’s a great destiny. With your help, we carried out the largest tax and regulation cuts, by far, in American history. And they now want to quadruple taxes and they want to quadruple and beyond the regulation cuts. And when we say tax and we say regulation, and you say, oh, tax cuts, that’s so wonderful, but the people in this room that are the heads of industry, you have some very powerful people in this room, they know that the regulation cuts may have been even more important than the biggest tax cuts we’ve ever had. To build a highway in this country could take in certain places, 18, 19, 20, even 21 years to get approved. It’s just not even thinkable. And we’ve got it now down to two and we’ll have it down to probably one and it may get rejected for safety reasons or for environmental reasons, that’s okay, it may happen. But we have it down, we will soon have it down to one year from as much as 21 years, we have cases that have just been disastrous. So I just wanted you to know some of the little details, but that’s what we’re working on. We’ll have it down to one year to build a highway. You can do it all in one year, it doesn’t have to take 21 years and cost a hundred times more, literally, I’ve seen a hundred times more. We eliminated Obamacare’s unfair individual mandate penalty, which is really the elimination of Obamacare. And to give to critically ill patients access to lifesaving drugs, we passed a thing called and hopefully nobody in his room will need it, but if you do it’s Right to Try, we have the greatest medicines, the greatest doctors and labs in the world and we have things that won’t be approved by the FDA for a little while, although I’ve cut that time now down in half. Used to be 12 years, now we’ve cut it down more than half. And you see that with the vaccines, you see it with the therapeutics. But Right to Try, where we have the right to now go in and use some of these very promising drugs and the response has been unbelievable. What’s happened and the lives saved have been really incredible. People used to leave for Asia. They used to leave for Europe. They used to leave for other places all over the world, or they’d go home and die. They’d go home and dive. If they had no money, they’d go home and die, which is most people. Now they sign a very short, simple document and they have the Right to Try and it’s given them hope and in many cases, it’s given their life back. So it’s been a great thing. These are things that nobody talks about that, but they’ve been trying to get that approved, by the way, not as easy as it sounds. It’s complicated because you have the insurance companies and the doctors and the hospitals and the country itself doesn’t want to get sued. And so it’s not very easy, but they’ve been trying to get it approved for 41 years, they’ve been trying to get that, that’s just one of many, many things that we’ve done, for 41 years. To provide our amazing veterans the care they deserve, we passed VA Accountability and VA Choice. Many, many decades they’ve been trying to get that. Choice meaning you wait in line and you can’t see a doctor and they would wait in line for a week or two weeks or five weeks, sometimes they’d be ill and they’d end up being terminally ill by the time they saw the doctor and we’re letting them go out and get a private doctor immediately and we pay the bill. And we just got a 91% approval rating in the VA, the highest we’ve ever had by many points, 91%. VA Accountability sounds simple, but it’s not. You couldn’t let anybody go, no matter how they disrespected our great vets, no matter what they said to them, no matter how badly they treated them. And we had sadists and we had thieves, we had a lot of bad people. You couldn’t fire them under any circumstances, under any circumstance you couldn’t fire them. And now we say, “You. You’re fired.” It’s called VA Accountability and they’ve wanted to have that. Actually they’ve let go of 9,000 people, replaced them with people that love our vets, want to take care of our vets, great people and we had a terrible thing going, you couldn’t get them fired because of civil service and unions and different things. You couldn’t fire them, now you can fire them, you can fire them quickly if they’re not doing the job. It’s a big deal and we don’t talk about it a lot, nobody talks about it, but they’ve been trying to get those two things approved for more than four decades and now they’re done and they’re approved. We ended the Obama/Biden administration’s war on American energy. And the United States is now the leading producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world. It’s a big thing. And remember this, if you look at what they’re doing, Biden, he wants to end fracking, end petroleum products, end petroleum, no natural gas, no nothing, end everything. And that’s it. How does that work in Texas? How does that work in Pennsylvania? I was in Pennsylvania yesterday. A place that he said he was born in, which is true, but he left when he was like nine years old. So he left a long time ago, he left seven decades ago and he still calls it his home. And his real home is a place he never leaves anymore, never leaves. Never leaves the outskirts of that state. You’d think he’d go a little bit, it’s not that far. Never leaves. We’ll figure it out pretty soon. But they want to end fracking, they want to end drilling, they want to end everything, they want to end all of this. So I said, think of it, they want to end oil, they want to end, and this is the way it is, guns, they want to take away Second Amendment. Right? How about that? That alone should win you the election. That alone. And I protect your Second Amendment and you think that was easy for the last four years? Everyone’s, “Oh, look, he’s wilting. He’s wilting.” And no, we’re not welting. We’ve had people that were in tragedies and they lost a son in school and they lost a daughter, beautiful Meadow. And that gentleman has been a friend of mine, he knows exactly who I’m talking about. Beautiful Meadow, they’re totally in favor, they’ve actually gotten hard line on Second Amendment, it’s not one way. It’s a incredible thing to see actually. But we held totally strong and it’s always going to be with us. But if they get in, they will absolutely either obliterate it to a point of no return or actually terminate it and I have no doubt about it. I have absolutely no doubt about it. And it’s something we can’t let happen, such a big part of our security and our safety and your entertainment and all, but I say security and safety probably first, right? And God, it’s an attack on God. It’s an attack on religion. Did you see the man that got up and saying a very, very special phrase from a very, very special thing? And he left the word God out and I was watching and I said, “Oh, he must’ve made a mistake.” I didn’t think that he left it out, I thought maybe he… You know, that can happen, maybe he made a mistake. He didn’t make a mistake, that’s where they’re coming from. He left the word God out and that’s where they’re coming from. I withdrew from the one sided Paris… If you see it, the Paris Climate, I call it the Paris Climate Disaster. This was a way of taking advantage of the United States. We wouldn’t be able to drill, we wouldn’t be able to frack, we wouldn’t have energy. Russia went way back into the dirtiest years, China didn’t even come into it until 2030 or 2035 and when they did, they came in very lightly. We came in immediately and we would have had to close down many, many businesses in order to achieve the goals that they set, which are totally unrealistic. It was a disaster. And you know, it’s an amazing thing, when I did that and when I did a couple of others, environmental bills, the Clean Waters Act how about that? That sounds so beautiful. The name is so beautiful. In fact, when I did it, I said, I’m going to be killed on this one, and I did it. And I was surrounded by farmers and developers, builders that built houses and others and they never cried, they’re very strong people, they never cried a day in their life. They were almost all crying. There was a big strong guy, I said, “When was the last time you cried?” “I can’t remember, sir.” I gave them back their life. That took away their life. And what we did in Minnesota with the iron ore, people up to me, they said, “You gave us back our life, Obama wrote it out.” Iron ore, the best in the world. He wrote it out. We gave it back to them. We went up to Maine, we gave them back their lobsters, we gave them back their fishing. We gave them back their lobsters. We gave them back their fishing. 5,000 square miles. Think of what that is. Take one mile, mile by mile, and now you add five. As big as the ocean is, that was a big chunk right off the coast of Maine. Their whole thing is lobsters and fishing, and nobody does it better. And they were not allowed. It was a monument, called a monument. I said, “A monument to what?” I said when I was up in Maine two weeks ago, I said to people that their whole life was lobster, fishing, the different things, and they’re the best. I said, “What happened?” They said, “He took away our everything.” I said, “How does this area compare to other areas?” He said, “First of all, it takes a long time to get to the other areas. This is so big. But second of all, this is the best there is in the world and he doesn’t let us use it.” And I said, “And yet, you vote Democrat and [crosstalk 00:00:19:14].” It’s like Israel. Look what I did for Israel. Thank you. But it’s amazing to me because nobody’s been worse to Israel than President Obama and Biden, nobody. Nobody’s been worse. Look at the Iran deal, it’s the worst thing that ever happened to Israel. And they never moved the embassy to Jerusalem thereby making Jerusalem the capital of Israel, which I did. And neither did any other president. And I understand why. They campaign on it, campaign. Every president said they were going to do it, no president did it until I came along. And I will tell you, the pressure from other parts of the world was enormous. And I’ve told the story a few times where I just turned off my phone and when the king calls and this one calls and that one calls, “We’re calling about Israel.” I say, “Tell them I’ll get back in a couple of days. I’ll get back in a couple of days. I’ll be in next week.” Kings and queens and prime ministers and presidents and dictators, everybody was calling. “Don’t do it. Don’t do it. It’ll be bloodshed all over the Middle East.” Look what we just did, right? With the United Arab Emirates and Israel. And now others will follow. And we couldn’t have done that if we had the deal with Iran. But they said, “Don’t do it, don’t do it with Israel. Don’t do it.” And I didn’t take that call. And I did it, had a ceremony. It was fine. Nothing happened. Remember? The world was going to blow up. This will be the end of the world. So I held my breath and I did it. And you know what happened? Nothing. Except we did something that should have been done many, many decades ago. And every president violated their promise, their campaign promise, except for me. And I did it. And by the way, I added in Golan Heights. That was a big one too, by itself. And I did it. And it’s incredible. I then call up these heads of state, many of whom are friends of mine, I get along. Actually, you don’t hear this from the fake news back there, oh, there’s a lot of press, a lot of press. But you don’t hear this from the people back there, but I actually have very good relationships with leaders, with many of them. And some of them just take too much advantage of our country, including some of our so-called allies. Some of them are the worst for taking advantage of us, but you don’t hear that. So what I did is I called some of the leaders the following week. “Hi, how you doing? What’s up?” “Oh, we wanted to talk to you about Israel, but you already did it.” I said, “Oh, I wish I got to you a little bit sooner.” But that’s easier than having somebody asking you over and over, “Please don’t do it.” But I could see there was a lot of pressure. I never understood why it wasn’t done it. It wasn’t done because there’s tremendous pressure put on the President of the United States by many other countries, much more than you would think, and different countries than you would even think. Countries that you wouldn’t think even cared about it were calling, asking not to do it. So we did it and it’s been really quite historic, I guess. And I could run in Israel and I think they said I’m probably a 98% approval rating in Israel. It’s been great. And you know who appreciates it the most are the evangelical Christians. They appreciate it the most. That has been, just by itself, that’s one thing out of many, many things, but that’s been quite an interesting journey. But we also took historic action to stand up to China’s trade cheating and plundering. You know that? We had the best year we ever had and they’ve had the worst year they’ve had in 67 years. I wonder why. And I don’t want them to have bad years, but there’s been nobody that has ripped off the United States like China for so many years, how presidents before me allowed that to happen. And especially the one just before me. And Joe Biden with his son walking out with $1.5 billion to manage, meaning millions of dollars a year in fees, is a disgrace. That guy, he’s a disgrace. And then the vast sums of money he was paid by a Ukrainian company that didn’t have the highest standing, to put it mildly, but the vast sums of money. If that ever happened to a Republican, they would have been in jail a long time ago. It’s such a double standard. I can’t tell you. This whole thing with all of the things that happened, the deep state, you can believe it, you don’t have to believe it, but it’s very unfair. And I will say that if a Republican ever did what Joe Biden did with calling off the prosecutors or you’re not going to get a billion dollars, and he’s on tape. It’s not like, “Oh, gee.” I mean, he’s on tape. We wouldn’t have had a chance. It’s a disgrace. The double standard is a disgrace. And hopefully it’ll be brought back to fairness. And remember this, they spied on my campaign and they got caught. They can say what they want. This FBI agent has just now, first one, admitted. That’s the beginning, hopefully, of the falling castle. But he’s admitted that he forged documents. He changed documents, reversing them, and he admitted it. So let’s see what’s going to happen over the next, hopefully, short period of time. Because it’s been unfair that we’ve had to wait so long. That was so obvious for a long time, and it should never be allowed to happen to another president again. That I can tell you. And that’s for the good of the country. Not for me, for the good of the country. Within three years, we replaced NAFTA, which everybody said was impossible to do, with a brand new and really pro-America USMCA. It’s a whole different ball game. And we don’t want to lose our companies to Mexico and Canada. And this puts a tremendous price tag on doing that. If they want to do that, they won’t be doing that. In everything we do, my administration is fighting for the American people and delivering one victory after another. We have appointed more than 230 federal judges. We expect to be perhaps over 300 federal judges by the end of the year. Thank you. I can tell you it’s driving them crazy. Don’t forget President Obama. They say he was a great president. Well, you can’t be a great president when much of what he’s done we’ve undone. And you can’t be a great president when you leave 142 empty judgeships. I don’t think any president’s left any. These are very, very important things for a party. Different policies, different everything. You understand it better than anybody, the people in this room. Left us 142. First day in office, I said, “How many judges do I have to appoint?” “Sir, you have 142.” I said, “You have to be kidding. 140.” So I had a big headstart. But we have 142. But now we will have, I think, in excess, by the time we finish, in excess of 300, including Court of Appeals. And of course, two very exceptional Supreme Court justices. So good, really good. And remember this in terms of get out the vote. The next president, I think, could have anywhere from two to four to maybe even five, just based on statistics, statistically, Supreme Court justices to pick. Think of that. I’ve had two. Some presidents have had none because you generally pick them young and they last a long time, right? They can last a long time. But we could have two to three to four, maybe even to five. It’s probably a stretch, but four isn’t a stretch at all. That would mean that the entire balance of the court doesn’t just shift, it becomes dominant. So if we don’t win, which we don’t want to think about, we have to think positively, and the polls today, Rasmussen, 51%. And they were the ones that got it right last time, them and a few others. 51%. They don’t want to show those. They only want to show those polls, not likely voters, registered voters. What does that mean? Many are dead. Many have switched their party affiliations. Registered, they don’t show likely. But you see some of these polls where they interview many more Democrats than Republicans. And they have to, I guess, by law, they interviewed. But many more. And they don’t go likely. Why don’t they do likely voters? Because I think they’d be very upset. I think they know they’d be very upset. Bottom line, we’re doing very well. We have the biggest crowds. I think there’s more enthusiasm now for this election than there was even, it’s record enthusiasm, by the way, record setting enthusiasm right now, it’s more now than we had even four years ago. Does that make sense? And we had the same thing four years ago where they say … But now we’ve done so much. This is easier in many ways. We were sailing. By the way, without the plague from China, this thing was over. This was over, we were sailing. But that came in and then you have to prove yourself again. So now I have to prove myself again, but we’re doing that. We’re building up the economy. We’re way ahead, by every poll, even the fake polls, we’re way ahead on the economy, which is very important. But we are. I mean, think of it. You prove yourself, you’re in this, and now you have to do it again. But that’s what we’re doing. We have the V, we have the super V we can talk about. But with the help of countless faith leaders, many of you are in the room, we appreciate it, we passed historic criminal justice reform. And nobody’s done more for the Black community or the Hispanic community than we have. Nobody, nobody. I guess maybe Lincoln, questionable. Abraham Lincoln. But I don’t think anybody, with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln, but nobody’s done more. If you look at opportunity zones, you look at all of the things we’ve done, nobody’s done more. After years of neglect by both parties, my administration understands that a strong nation must have strong borders. By next week, we will have gone up to over, as I say, 300 miles. That’s hard to believe. And that was tough. They didn’t want it. Do you notice now that we’re building it you don’t hear about it anymore? They don’t want to talk about it anymore. And it’s a bad issue for the Democrats because everyone knows that walls work. It’s interesting. No matter with all the technology and all the changes you see, you don’t recognize a computer from five years ago, it’s not even recognizable, two things don’t change, right? Walls and wheels. And you can come back in 2000 years from now and two things will still be around, wheels and walls. Remember when they were saying the wall doesn’t do anything? They wanted to have a drone flying around, flying around to join so you could watch everybody pour into our country. We’ve ended catch and release, one of the great scams of all time. We catch them and release them. They should say catch and release into our country because you catch them and then you release them and you weren’t allowed to bring them back. Now we bring them back. We absolutely bring them back. We’ve dismantled drug smuggling and human trafficking. These networks are horrible. Human trafficking in women. Which has turned out, you think of it as almost an ancient crime, but it’s not. It’s bigger now all over the world than it’s ever been because of the computer, because of the internet. It’s bigger now than ever before. It’s a horrible thing. Much of it through the southern border, but all over the world this is taking place. And we’ve brought it down to levels that nobody thought even possible. But it’s a terrible thing. Mostly trafficking in women. Children to a lesser extent, but women. We’ve removed 20,000 gang members, including 4,500 MS-13 members, and we brought them back to their countries. And their countries, under the Obama administration, didn’t want to take people. You know that, right? They didn’t want to take them. They said, “No, don’t bring them back here. We’re not taking them.” Guatemala, El Salvador, right? Honduras. They wouldn’t take people back. Now they take them back. They say, “Oh, thank you very much.” The last administration left us with a Middle East in chaos. This was a Middle East in chaos. Iran was empowered and exporting terror. They don’t have too much money now. They’re not spending billions of dollars giving it to Al Qaeda, Hezbollah, some of these wonderful groups that are totally vicious, crazed lunatics. But Iran is different. It’s having a hard time. It’s GDP went down at a level that you wouldn’t even believe, in the 20s. And they’ll make a deal. I say they’ll make a deal within a month, but I probably mean a week. But I just want to be right. Because they’ll call me. They’ll say, “It took 10 days. He was wrong.” They just want to see. If I win, they’ll be in making a deal. And if for some reason I don’t, they’ll take their time and they will get one of the great deals since the last one where we paid them 150 billion. Billion. Gave them 150 for nothing. It wasn’t even a long term deal. You know, right now, the time is almost up. This was a short term deal. It’s like you rent a store in a shopping center. These are countries we’re dealing with. You need length, but it was a short term deal. But more important, we gave them 1.8 billion in cash. Think of that. Cash, cash. We flew it in in Boeing 757s loaded from floor to ceiling with cash. What were these people thinking? And had I kept that deal, we terminated that deal, had I kept that deal, we could never have started this incredible thing that’s happening with UAE, Israel. And everybody’s saying, “Why haven’t you invited us?” Okay. Many countries now want to come in. This was an impossible thing to even conceive of, impossible. Even Tom Friedman at the New York Times gave us an A plus. Can you believe it? He couldn’t even believe it. I wouldn’t say he’s been a big fan, but the New York Times gave us the best editorial I’ve had. I can’t even believe it. I’m surprised they did. I’m sure they’ve changed it by now. Somebody got in, they said, “Who wrote that editorial?” They probably lost their job. But Tom Friedman actually wrote the editorial. It was very fair. It’s true. He couldn’t believe it. It’s gotten great reviews from everybody. Wall Street Journal, Washington Post. Can you believe that one? Everybody gave it and we couldn’t have done that deal had we stayed in this horrible deal done by John Kerry who just had no clue as to negotiation. He never got out. They would tell him, ” We want this. We want this. We want this.” And he’d sit there and he’d agree to everything. Sometimes you have to get up and walk. He never got up and walked. Once he rode his bicycle. Remember it? He was in an accident. I promised at 73 years old, I said, “I’ll never be riding a bicycle.” He had the helmet. He had the names, the insignias all over. He had insignias like he was a 20 year old great cyclist from France. So that delayed him about two months. They said, “He just got hurt in a bicycle accident.” What? It’s not a good accident when you … So I promised I wouldn’t do that. I might get hurt, but I’m not getting hurt riding a bicycle. But if you look at the Obama Administration, ISIS was rampaging all over. I’ve defeated 100% of the ISIS caliphate in Iraq and Syria. Yesterday we had the Prime Minister of Iraq in my office and he made a statement. He said, “Sir, I want to thank you. You have defeated ISIS.” I said, “Wait a minute. You say that. Nobody ever says that. Those people back there don’t say it. What do you mean by that?” He said, “You.” I said, “Do you mean Obama? Do you mean the United States?” “Sir, Obama, it was a disaster. When you took over ISIS was in 30% of our country. You came in and you defeated.” I said, “Will you please go public with that?” So he said, “I would,” he would. But it’s true. I mean, we defeated 100% of the caliphate and we turned it all around. We rebuilt the United States military, $2.5 trillion. We have a brand new beautiful military. And as I said with Israel, we got out of the Iran Nuclear Deal, which was such a horrible thing for Israel. But I asked a friend of mine, who’s a big fan of Israel, I said, “So what was the best? Golan Heights, Jerusalem capital? What was more important of the two?” Golan Heights, which they’ve been working on for 52 years, recognition of Golan Heights for Israel. 52 years, planes would fly in. They’d have summits every year or two, planes would fly in. They’d talk, they’d talk and keep talking. Two days later, the planes would fly out. Then they’d meet two years later. 52 years, they went through that. I got it done immediately. I said, “Which is more important, Golan Heights or Jerusalem Capitol?” I said, “Neither.” I said, “What do you mean neither?” He said, “The most important is when you withdrew from that horrible and very dangerous Iran Nuclear Deal. That was the greatest thing you did for Israel.” It’s very interesting. And I said, “I agree.” I actually said, “I agree.” We imposed the toughest ever US sanctions in Iran. And this week we invoked the snapback provisions to restore virtually all of the previously suspended UN sanctions. We snapped it back. It’s a good term. The founder and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi, is dead. We killed him. And the world’s top terrorist, probably over 50 years the top terrorist, Qasem Soleimani, is dead. He’s gone. But the more success that we’ve achieved, the more unhinged the radical left has become. Anarchists and violent mobs have rioted in our Democrat run cities, attacking our police and tearing down statues. And as you know, I signed a clause. I got an old bill, you know when they used to do powerful things, when they knew what the hell they were doing. I took an old bill and I gave a nice, beautiful brand new executive order. It says very easily, could you imagine getting this today? You rip down a statue, a federal statute, you go to jail, prison, they use the term prison. You go to prison for 10 years. And I remember there was a big march on Washington. They were coming in to knock a lot of statues down. They even had a Thomas Jefferson plan. That was in their planning. No thanks. George Washington. They were even thinking about Lincoln. Lincoln did sort of a pretty good job, right? But they were talking about anybody. I don’t even know if they knew what they were doing. They’re just wild and out of control. But I signed this 10 years in prison if you knocked down a statue. We have people right now in jail that are going to trial by the way. And that was from previous-But if you remember, that was a big thing two and a half months ago. You know when I signed it? Two and a half months ago. Two and a half months ago I signed it. We haven’t had a problem since. They say, “We want to knock down that statute, but 10 years. Let’s say. 10 years. That’s a lot of time. That’s a lot of time.” Which tells you that laws, if properly utilized, can stop all of this madness. And that’s why we have to give our great police back their dignity and their power. I’ve been endorsed by almost every police organization in the country. We just got the other day, Pat Lynch, the head of New York City Police, endorsed me. First endorsement he said, to the best of his knowledge, which is a lot of knowledge, the first time they’ve ever endorsed a candidate for president. That’s good. They don’t endorse. The first time ever. All the sheriffs in Florida. Dan can tell you all of the law enforcement in Texas, right? All of the law enforcement in Texas, Dan. So it’s good. And just about everywhere. We have tremendous support. And you’re always going to have bad apples, by the way. You got some bad apples and you’re going to have it probably in this room. We might have one or two. But you have bad apples. But these are great people that do a phenomenal job that actually are appreciated by the public. By the public they’re appreciated and they’re loved and they’re respected and the public doesn’t want to happen what’s happening to our police. They took away their dignity. They took away their right to do the job that they want to do. And they’re doing the job now. And for me, they do the job. You look at most cities in our country, crime is actually down. You look at Chicago and you say, “How’s that possible?” You look at New York, what’s happened just in a short period of time, but we’re with them and they’re with us and they’ve done a fantastic job. So the future of our country, and indeed our civilization, is at stake on November 3rd. Earlier this summer, murders rose by 29% in New York city, 33% in Philadelphia, 53% in Chicago, 133% in Minneapolis. These are all Democrat run places. These are Democrat run. I might say radical left Democrat in some cases. But these are people that don’t have any clue what they’re doing. They have no idea. I don’t even think they know that it’s bad what’s going on. You know, you’d almost say they’re trying to defend it. It’s incredible to hear them. But that’s why I launched Operation Legend, which has led to the arrest of 1,500 criminals since July. And the radical left spent four years trying to illegally overturn the last election. They’re still trying to overturn. Hillary Clinton, remember the Hillary Clinton. “Will you honor the election, the results of the election?” That was Hillary Clinton. And she should have asked that question to herself. She’s like a crazed lunatic. She’s a lunatic. She is something, I’ll tell you. But somebody said, what’s the difference between Clinton and Biden? Should I say? Should I tell you? Well, Clinton is much smarter, but not a likable person. Joe is not nearly as smart, but he’s more likable. So I don’t know. Maybe I’d rather have the smarter person. Who cares about personality, right? But that’s the difference. Very simple, isn’t it? Huh? It’s a very simple thing. But that’s why we have to win. We have to win. So now the Democrats are planning to permanently alter our political system so their control is never threatened again. They want to pack the court with radical left justices, abolish the filibuster, which frankly, I wish we did it because I said, “They’re going to do it. So we might as well get there first.” But I couldn’t get a couple of people to go along with me, but my attitude was, “Schumer’s going to do it.” They all said, “No, he’ll never do that. He’ll never do it.” Guess what? They’re doing it. They’re doing it. And as much as we’ve done, we’ve done more than anybody has ever done in three and a half years. But you know what? As much as we’ve done, we would’ve done more had we done that, because getting those extra 10 votes was almost impossible with these people. Almost impossible. So I wish we had done it. I wanted to do it, but we had some obstacle and obstacles. grant. They want to grant mass amnesty for millions of people and citizenship they want to give to many million illegal aliens, probably about 11 million at least. And they want to abolish voter ID. They want to abolish voter ID to get into the DNC Convention last night, you needed an ID with your picture on it. Now what does that tell you about … To get in last night a friend of mine were saying, a friend of mine who happened to be there, I said, “Why were you there?” And a very political person, but shows me. He said, “Here’s the ID. It’s got my picture. It’s like the most incredible …” It’s a disgrace. There’s only one reason they don’t want voter ID. And that’s because they want to cheat. That’s all. It cannot be anything else. I mean, you have it on everything. You have it on driver’s licenses. You have on everything just about. And the only one they don’t want it on is a vote, which the most important thing you have is your vote and they don’t want it. We have it in some states, Indiana, we have some great really voter ID. They want to abolish it where it is and never allow it to happen again. And that’s only a bad thing. That’s only a bad thing. To everyone in this room, your organization was formed at a time when conservatives led the fight to turn back the tide of communism abroad, communism here. It’s a very important organization. Now Americans must rally to turn back the radical left socialists and Marxists right here at home. And you see that when you see these people rioting in Portland, where you see the anger, the craziness. These people are crazy. They’re crazy. And we won’t let it go on much longer by the way, because they’re supposed to police their own town, but we’re not going to let it go on much longer, because at some point we have to say, “Okay, you’ve had enough time to police your town.” And by the way, they have good police. Portland has good police, but again, they’re not allowed to do their job. If our opponents prevail, no one will be safe in our country and no one will be spared. No one will be spared, including the people that help fund. They think they’re going to be best pals. They’re not going to be best pals. They’ll be terminated just like many others. I’m the only thing standing between the American dream and total anarchy, madness and chaos. And that’s what it is. I’m representing you. I’m just here. And I’m not sure it’s an enviable position, but that’s what it is. That’s what it is. When I made that statement, I was a little embarrassed by it because it sounds so egotistical. It’s an egotistical statement. And I was a little embarrassed, “I’m the only one.” But there was no other way to say it. We have to win the election. I’m the one. If we win, all of these things that we talked about, pro-life by the way, second amendment by the way. No. If we don’t win, it’s all gone. Okay? It’s all gone. And we mentioned, I have to mention life, all gone, second amendment, gone. It’s all gone. And many other things. It will be a totally different country. And ultimately it will fail. It will fail. It can’t work. Economically it can’t work. We’ll go into a depression. And I’m very good at predicting these things. We will go into a depression, no different, maybe worse, no different than what happened in 1929. Your stocks will crash. Your 401ks will be worthless. This is going to happen. And the radical left will bring him along so quickly. I don’t know if you saw the Congress woman the other day where she said, “He will do whatever I tell him to do. He’s perfect. He will do whatever I tell him to do.” This is a Congresswoman. And Bernie Sanders is saying the same thing. Bernie Sanders is saying, “Look, we’ll just let him be in there. And then when he gets in, we’ll take it over.” That’s what’s going to happen. Because that’s where their party is. It’s become a sick ideology and we have to win. We will solve the problem very quickly, very easily. We have to win. I don’t like this mail in ballot deal. They’re going to send out 51 million mail in ballots to people that haven’t requested that. Well, where are they going? Look at what happened in New York with Carolyn Maloney, a small race. And they declared her the winner. They don’t even have the ballots. It’s so mixed up. So fraudulent. And the only reason they declared her a winner is because I was right up. I said, “[inaudible 00:16:37], what’s going on?” Six weeks and they couldn’t count the votes. That’s one little race. What’s going to happen when you have 150 million votes and you have 51 million votes. Think of it. They’re going to send out 51 million. It could be higher than that. 51 million votes, no signature verification on many of them. In Nevada no signature verification. In New Jersey no signature verification. In New Jersey the governor passed it and didn’t even have the legislature approve it. He did it with an executive order, which is interesting. I mean, how do you do this? But think of it. You don’t have to know anything about politics. You don’t have to know anything. Just common sense. Right? And a lot of you are great business people. 51 million. It’s not an absentee ballot where you request it, they send it, you send it back. It’s good. Like in Florida. 51 million people are going to get ballots to send in. So if it’s them, let’s say, that they’re doing it, and it’s mostly Democrat states that want it and their Democrat governors, they’re going to send them to certain areas, I guess. I guess. So people are going to be getting them and said, “Oh, all right. That’s fine.” And they’ll send them back. And some of them harvesting is allowed. That’s where you harvest them all together. In Nevada, harvesting’s allowed. So they’ll go all over the world and they’ll get people to sign them. “Hey, you used to be here.” They go all over the world to get … and they’ll harvest them, and they’ll drop thousands of them on a table just before the election. The other thing is, if you do this, you’ll never have an election count on November 3rd. You know, the way we enjoyed … well, we enjoyed, I’m not sure they did. They didn’t enjoy it. But the greatest evening ever was four years ago, right? And that night, four years ago, that was an extraordinary night, but we knew that night. In fact, we really knew before 9:00, even though it took like 2:00 to call it. They refused to call Pennsylvania, which we had. If we lost every single vote, remember, there was two points, two left. Two points left. And if we lost every vote, we won Pennsylvania. They refused to call it. But they called Wisconsin. They called Michigan. They called places that haven’t done really very well for Republicans. But if you look at Michigan now, we’re building many car plants. They hadn’t built car plants in 42 years. We’re expanding and building car plants. I mean, a lot of good things are going to happen. But you’re not going to be able to know the end of this election, in my opinion, for weeks, months, maybe never, maybe years, but maybe never. Because once you go past the first week, you’re never going to know. What’s going to happen, they’re going to be taking them and hiding them. You saw what happened in Broward County in Florida, where they were, everyday, 10,000 gone, 10,000. Rick Scott, he was great the way he did that. And we helped them a lot. And Governor DeSantis, 10,000, 10,000 … if we would have waited a couple of days, you wouldn’t have had the same governor and you wouldn’t have had the same senator. We took very strong action, because it was obvious what was going on. So now you’re going to have 51 million ballots, Tom. Where’s Tom? Where is he? Stand up, Tom, Tom Fitten. I don’t know … that’s Judicial Watch. I don’t know if everyone agrees, but I do. They do a fantastic job. I wish he had more help. I mean, honestly, I wish he had more help. But it’s not easy beating a system that’s been in place for many, many years. Many, many years it’s been in place and it’s sad. But 51 million votes, it’s being sent, and nobody knows who’s getting them. And what happens if you send them to an old Democrat area, but not to an all Republican area? How do you win an election? This is really a very serious problem. This is beyond me. This is not to say me or, this is about all of us. This is about the country. This is about the country. It could happen the other way too. I mean, it could happen the other way too. I don’t think it will happen the other way. I don’t think it will. But I think this is a very disgraceful situation. I really don’t think that you’re going to know anything on the evening, anything meaningful or anything real on the evening of November 3rd. I don’t think you’re going to know anything. You’re not going to know what happened. I don’t think you’ll two weeks later. I don’t think you’ll know four weeks later. And I don’t know what’s going to happen. You know, there’s a theory that if you don’t have it by the end of the year, crazy Nancy Pelosi would become president. You know that, right? No, no, think of that. Think of that. There’s that mad theory too. You have heard that theory. Now I don’t know if it’s a theory or a fact, but I said, “That’s not good. That’s not good.” No, no. There is a theory that if you don’t have it, and that’s part of their whole act, that if you don’t have a choice, that the Speaker of the House becomes president. And that, I think, goes into effect either on the 20th or the first, and put that in the hopper, add that to everything else. It’s a disgrace. They know it’s filthy dirty. Patterson New Jersey, Virginia, New York, many, many cases all over the country. Just recent, I’m talking about recently. And it’s not even the post office, although the mailmen become very popular people, I have to tell you that. That’s happened too. That’s happened too. Even mailmen. But think about what they’re doing to our country when they do this. We voted in World War I. We voted in World War II. And now we can’t vote anymore. And that’s still a long time away. The pandemic is … if you look at Florida, if you look at Arizona, you look at California, those numbers are going down very rapidly. Many, many states have very little problem. You look at a map now, it’s largely really in good shape. I mean, I’m going to talk about it in my speech on Thursday. We’ve done a great job. We have not been recognized for what we’ve done. We’ve done a great job. So in two and a half months from now, we’ll be in good shape. And we’re going to be in really, I think, potentially really good shape. And we can’t let this happen to our country. It’s called universal mail-ins, okay. They like the word universal, ’cause it explains it. I don’t know why. I personally don’t like the name. I just call it mail-in. But we want to distinguish it from absentee voting, which is okay, which has gone on for a long time. And we’re prepared for that. But we’re not prepared for this 51 million ballots. It will be a tremendous embarrassment to our country. It’ll go on forever, and you’ll never know who won. So I say that for you. I say it for the cameras, because I assume that goes out. But I will tell you that this is a very serious problem for a great democracy. This is a very, very serious problem. And something has to be done about it. And they’re being sent almost as we speak. People are going to get ballots that had no intention of voting, that may be shouldn’t be voting. That may be aren’t. And they’d say the computers will pick it up. The computers are going to pick up nothing. They’re going to pick up nothing. You’ll have double voting, where they send in a ballot and then they’ll go and vote. That’s going to be a big problem. They’ll send in their ballot and then they’ll vote too. They’ll send in the ballot and then they’ll vote. What are the chances that some state’s so efficiently run? “Oh gee, you can’t vote. We just got your ballot last night at 7:00.” I mean, think of how ridiculous it is, right, common sense. I say this for the media. This will be the greatest catastrophe, one of the greatest catastrophes in the history of our country. That’s how serious it is. And they also think I’m trying to steal an election, just the opposite. I want the fair results of an election. So the damage that they inflict will not just last a year or an election cycle, it will echo for generations, and we may never be able to escape, no matter how great our future leaders. We may never, ever escape from the damage that will be inflicted if the radical left takes over the presidency. We may never be able to. Remember the Supreme Court, but we may never be able to do it. It’ll be too late. The country will go down so far that you’ll never ever, I don’t care who you are, be able to bring it back. There’s now a major American political party that supports decriminalizing illegal border crossings, abolishing cash bail. You kill somebody, no bail. They want to close all prisons, outlaw American energy, confiscate your guns, force taxpayers to finance late term abortion. They want to ban charter schools, abolish school choice, destroy our beautiful suburbs. I have done more for suburbia, where they talk about the suburban woman, “Will she vote for Trump?” If she doesn’t, I mean, what is she doing? They want to force low income housing into suburbia. And now the one that wants to do it is Cory Booker. Cory Booker’s a disaster. You saw him running for president. He eventually quit when he started getting below 1%. How about all these people? How about Kamala? Kamala runs, she’s sort of one of the favorites. And she goes from 15 to 13 to 12 to nine to seven, five, four. About one, she got out. She didn’t even get to Iowa. She never got there. She didn’t want to take a vote. That’s how bad she was. Don’t you want to pick a person that’s gone in the opposite direction? I mean, seriously. That’s like a free poll. But there’s something that’s not good going on there. I don’t think it was a good choice. It was my number one draft pick. I did say that. They said, “How do you like the choice?” I said, “That was my number one draft pick.” But I meant from my standpoint. But think of it. She was one of the favorites and she went down like a rock. So it’s one of those things. I believe one of the worst things going on now is the abolition of police, or even the partial abolition of police. So we have to expose this dangerous left-wing movement. We must defeat it, and with an optimistic vision for America’s future, we can be greater than ever before. We will be greater than ever before. With your help, that’s exactly what we’re going to do. We’ll once again build the greatest economy in history. We had it. We had to let it go to save millions of lives, and now we’re building it again. We’ll fully restore America’s manufacturing independence, bring home our critical supply chains, and permanently end our reliance on China. We’re going to lower drug prices. We’re going to lower drug prices at a level that’s never been lowered before. I’m the only president in 51 years that lowered last year, drug prices went down a little bit, not much, but a little bit. But under Obama and Biden, they went up 52%. We’ll create a healthcare system that protects vulnerable patients, lowers costs. We have transparency. It’s already done. It’s approved. It kicks into effect in January. This is going to lower your hospital stays, your doctor bills, gives you more choice and controls, and we’re going to deliver the highest quality care that our great American patients and people and seniors deserve. We’ll provide school choice to every parent in America. We’ll appoint more conservative judges and justices. We will protect religious liberty, defend the lives of the unborn, uphold free speech, and safeguard the second amendment and your right to keep and bear arms. So important, right? We’ll restore patriotic education to our schools. I mean, what they’re teaching students today is incredible. They come home, it’s like a different world. What is it? 1619 now, all of a sudden they changed. Now they’re thinking about making another change, because they don’t like that. But I don’t know. So I guess, 1492 Columbus discovered America. And that’s what we all … 1492 Columbus discovered America. That’s what it was. Now they want to get that, and poor Columbus. They’re ripping those … poor Christopher. Except in one tough Italian neighborhood in New York, they didn’t get away with it. Did you see that? Did you see it? The anarchists said, “Let’s get the hell out of here. This is dangerous.” The anarchists left. That was one very tough, great area. We love that area. I know it very well. They started surrounding it. They were all set. They had the ropes going, the whole deal. And all of a sudden they said, “Let’s get out of here.” Great. Christopher Columbus, can you believe it? Christopher Columbus. We will restore patriotic education to our schools and teach our children to love their country, honor our history, and respect our great American flag. Thank you. So this is the vision we believe in. And with your help, your talent, and you have incredible talent in this room, and your devotion, this is the bright future, not the dark future that you saw last night and for the last four days. This is a bright future that we will deliver for all Americans. I promise you this. As long as I am the president of the United States, I will fight with every ounce of energy and strength. And I have no doubt that our country will be greater than ever before. Thank you all very much. I appreciate it. It’s a great honor. Thank you. Thank you very much.

"42","08-23-20","Thank you very much, and it’s good to see you all. Hope you had a great weekend at your convention. We’re going to have a great convention coming up, and I look forward to it. But before I discuss a very historic breakthrough in our fight against the China virus, I’d like to provide an update on the recent wildfires in California and the storms in the Gulf of Mexico. Yesterday, I approved a major disaster declaration for California, spoke to Governor Newsom as they battled two of the worst wildfires in the history of their state. That continues. The federal government has already deployed over 26,000 first responders and personnel to battle the wildfires. We’re working very closely with the Governor and very closely with a lot of great state representatives and local representatives. We’ll take care of the situation, but we have 26,000 first responders already. Our hearts go out to the thousands of families who have lost their homes, as we grieve for the families of two first responders and five residents who have tragically lost their lives in a very horrific fire, one of the biggest we’ve ever seen. My administration is also closely monitoring Hurricane Marco and Tropical Storm Laura, which are coming in rapidly. Hurricane Marco is expected to make landfall in Louisiana tomorrow, and Tropical Storm Laura is expected to hit Louisiana two days later. This is somewhat unprecedented, the scope of the storms, and also the fact that they come so quickly after one another. Both storms have the potential of gathering strength before they make landfall and could cause significant damage across the Gulf Coast and also in Puerto Rico. We have everybody stationed and ready to go in Puerto Rico and the Gulf Coast. We have tremendous, tremendous people. FEMA is lined up. We have the Coast Guard ready. The Coast Guard has done a fantastic job. They do such good work, and we want to thank our great Coast Guard. I’m asking all Americans in the storm’s path to follow the instructions of your state and local governments very closely. I’ve approved emergency declarations for Puerto Rico and for Louisiana. FEMA is mobilized on the ground and is ready to help. They will be in there very quickly, very, very quickly. I spoke to Governor John Bel Edwards also of Louisiana, and I’ve informed him, and at his request also, a major disaster declaration is signed and ready to go. We have everybody ready in Puerto Rico, the Gulf Coast, Louisiana, and also on the forest fires in California. We have a great team. Unfortunately, we have some very, very powerful natural disasters. On the therapeutics front, this is what I’ve been looking to do for a long time. This is a great thing. Today, I’m pleased to make a truly historic announcement in our battle against the China virus that will save countless lives. The FDA has issued an Emergency Use Authorization, and a that’s such a powerful term, Emergency Use Authorization, for a treatment known as convalescent plasma. This is a powerful therapy that transfuses very, very strong antibodies from the blood of recovered patients to help treat patients battling a current infection. It’s had an incredible rate of success. Today’s action will dramatically expand access to this treatment. I want to thank Dr. Hahn and Secretary Azar. I want to thank the FDA, all of the people that have been working very hard on this. It showed tremendous potential. It’s only made possible because of Operation Warp Speed. That is everybody working together. We’re years ahead of approvals that we would be if we went by the speed levels of past administration. We’d be two years, three years behind where we are today, and that includes on vaccines that you’ll be hearing about very soon, very shortly. To deliver treatments and vaccine to save lives, we’re removing unnecessary barriers and delays, not by cutting corners, but by marshaling the full power of the federal government. We provided $48 million to fund the Mayo Clinic study that tested the efficacy of convalescent plasma for patients with the virus. Through this study over 100,000 Americans have already enrolled to receive this treatment, and it is proven to reduce mortality by 35%. It’s a tremendous number. The FDA, MIT, Harvard, and Mount Sinai Hospital have also found convalescent plasma to be a very effective method of fighting this horrible disease. Based on the science and the data, the FDA has made the independent determination that the treatment is safe and very effective. Recently, we provided up to $270 million to the American Red Cross and America’s blood centers to support the collection of up to 360,000 units of plasma. In late July, we launched a nationwide campaign to ask patients who have recovered, and these are patients that have been incredible the way they’ve donated. But these are people recovered from the virus to donate plasma. Since then, weekly plasma donations have doubled. Today, I once again urge all Americans who have recovered from the virus to go to coronavirus.gov and sign up and donate plasma today, please. It’s been really an incredible … Just incredible people. The country has united so strongly behind this. I’ll go over the numbers, but if you look at what’s happened and the success that we’ve had that people don’t talk about, the United States has experienced the lowest case fatality rate of any major country in the world. You don’t hear that. The European Union’s case fatality rate is estimated to be three times higher than that in the United States. Europe has seen 33% more fatalities compared to a typical non-pandemic year than the United States. I just want to ask two of our people that have done such a fantastic job, Alex Azar and Stephen Hahn to say a few words. Stephen, I want to thank you because the FDA really stepped up and especially over the last few days in getting this done. The results have been incredible, and I think you’ll see the results even go up very substantially. So we appreciate it. And maybe I’ll ask Alex to go first, and then Stephen. Thank you very much, Alex. Thank you very much. Please, Doctor? Thank you very much, Stephen. I appreciate it. Okay, any questions? Right. That’s a great question, and I’m not sure a lot of people have been thinking about right to try. We’re all waiting for the final answer. Maybe I could ask Stephen, but I would say that right to try is exactly … If somebody is virtually terminal, in other words they’re not going to make it, and if we have these incredible therapies and drugs that are happening, Alex, I think it’s a very interesting question. I congratulate you for that question because I think we’re-all waiting for that exact final endpoint. What about that, Stephen? We have all of these seemingly great answers that are ready to come out, but because of the process, it takes a little- Can we use some of this early under Right to Try? Please. I think it was something we have to really consider very strongly. I think it's fantastic. You should get credit for that. Thank you. That's very good. Please, in the back. Well, I think that there might have been a holdup, but we broke the logjam over the last week, to be honest. I think that there are people in the FDA and actually in your larger department that can see things being held up and wouldn’t mind so much. That’s my opinion, a very strong opinion. And that’s for political reasons. This has nothing to do with politics. This has to do with life or death. So we are being very strong, and we are being very forthright. We have got some incredible answers, and we’re not going to let them be held up because every day is lives, and we’re not going to let that happen. Okay? Very good, thank you. Please, go ahead. Well, I think I'll let Dr. Hahn answer that question. Okay, this is a very big day. It’s a day we’ve been looking forward to. Thank you very much. Great questions.
















"
"43","08-24-20","Thank you very much. Did you see the crowd outside? I don’t know if they report it. I don’t think they do. You know who they are, right? Fake news. No, I don’t know that they report it. That is an unbelievable, thousands and thousands of people lined up so far. It was very important for me to come to North Carolina because we wanted to be here, but your governor didn’t allow it because he’s in a shutdown mode along with a lot of other Democrat governors. And it’s too bad, but I want to thank Kirby and the incredible people I just met, farmers and wonderful business people and really, humanitarians, they’re incredible people. I’m thrilled to be at the Flavor First Growers and Packers facility here in the great state of North Carolina. Joe Biden was supposed to be in Wisconsin, but he never showed up. I showed up. In fact, we did a count, our vote we did here in North Carolina. We did it in Charlotte a little while ago. I was there, it was a great, exciting moment to actually. Today we’re here to celebrate the incredible work of the farmers and faith leaders and amazing volunteers who are caring for their community, through our highly successful farmers, to families food box program. I just looked at a couple of those boxes and I said, “I want to have something right now.” But they thought it would be inappropriate because I was coming up to speak. But beautiful looking stuff. We’re grateful to be joined by Secretary of Agriculture, Sonny Perdue, and somebody that you know, Ivanka Trump. And Ivanka has been a big supporter of this project and this whole program. And it’s made people that were looking for food happy and it’s made the farmers happy. With all of us, we’re just thrilled to be here. You have a representative named Ted Budd. Where’s Ted Budd? Where’s Ted? Ted, thank you very much. What a great warrior you’ve been, Ted Budd, Congressmen. Thank you Ted very much, I appreciate it. And where’s Madison, where is Madison? Is he here? If I had a face like that, I would have been president 20 years ago. If I looked like him, I would have been president 20 years ago, Kirby. Madison Cawthorn, and a real star. You’re going to be a star of the party. Thank you very much. What a great guy, great guy. He was in the oval office, I didn’t want my picture with him because he looks too good. Great. Proud of you too. And I hear you doing really well over there. Thank you very much, Madison. Also want to thank Mitch Gaither and Brian Rose, of Flavor First Growers, we appreciate you guys. Thank you. Thank you. And executive director of Baptists on Mission, Richard Brunson and many local leaders are here. Where’s Richard? Oh, Richard, thank you very much. Great job. That’s fantastic. Thank you Richard. When the China virus struck our nation, many farmers had no place to send their crops or livestock. At the same time, families across the country were in need of groceries, they wanted to eat well. And next year they’re going to be eating better than ever before, because we’re going to have a tremendous year. I’ll tell you, economically, you see the numbers coming in and you see even the employment numbers coming in. In the last quarter, more people hired, more jobs than any over 9 million jobs than at any quarter ever before, it’s a record. We’re going to have a great year, we’re going to have a great quarter, but we’re going to have a great year. That’s why we launched the Farmers to Families Food Box program. Through this program, the Department of Agriculture is purchasing food from farmers, then local distributors pack and deliver the boxes and families in need get it, and they get to eat very well. We’re tremendously grateful for the 185 employees here at this facility who have packed roughly 7,000 boxes a week. That’s not bad Kirby, right? 7,000 boxes a week is a lot of boxes. Thanks as well to the incredible volunteers at Baptist Sun Mission, who shipped boxes to over 200 pickup locations all across your great state. With your help in just three months, we’ve delivered over 1 billion pounds of food, providing more than 100 million meals to Americans most in need. And this is a program that just got started and they’re already a soon as I saw it, I saw one line that was hungry. And one line that had so much food, they had to dispose of it, the farmers. I said, “Let’s put them together.” And with Sonny and with all of the people that worked on it and Ivanka’s strong backing, we got it done in literally a week, right? We got it done. And I think might’ve even been less than a week. That’s not bad. Today, I’m proud to announce that we will provide an additional $1 billion to fund the Farmers to Families Food Box programs that’s worked out so well. It’s worked out so well. In our fight against the China virus, we’ve launched the greatest industrial mobilization. This is the greatest industrial mobilization, all of the things that we’ve done to, to take on this horrible, horrible scourge that’s come in. To take on this horrible, terrible plague, I call it sometimes. We didn’t deserve this, we didn’t deserve this. And they could have stopped it. And we had just signed an incredible trade deal with China. In fact, last week, Sonny was telling me the largest order of corn in the history of our country, twice largest order of soybeans in history. But I feel so differently because the ink wasn’t even dry on that trade deal when we got hit with the China virus, I feel very differently about it. In our fight against the virus, we’ve launched this mobilization. And it’s the biggest since World War Two. Biggest and most successful too. You’ll be hearing that on Thursday night, I’m going to be talking about it because what we’ve done is incredible. You would have had a situation, if you looked at the lives saved, if we didn’t close down, now reopened and we reopened. Problem is your governor doesn’t want to reopen. He wants to keep it shut down and you can’t do that, because there’s a lot of bad statistics on the other side, shut downs cause problems too, with suicide and depression and loss of jobs and loss of a lot of other things. So we have to get your state open. We have to get numerous states open that are run by Democrats, because I really believe on November 4th, they’re all going to be open. It’s going to be a miracle. We got to get Pennsylvania open. Now we have Pennsylvania, we have here, we have others. And well, Wisconsin is another one, right? All Democrats. They want to keep it close as long as possible, right up until the election, then they’re going to open it. But you know what? The numbers are so good anyway, that they are having a hard time. They’re having a little hard time with this whole situation. But yesterday, I announced that the FDA had issued an emergency use authorization for convalescent plasma. You probably saw that, which is proven to be an incredible reducer. It’s going to reduce mortality by at least 35%, could be much more than that. We’ll see the final numbers, but it could be even higher than that. And we did remdesivir and lots of other things, we’re going to be talking about it on Thursday nights. I hope you’re all going to be listening. Because the job that the FDA has done and the approval process has gone far faster than it would have ever gone under any other administration. I’m talking about the saving of years, the saving of years. Through operation Warp Speed, three vaccine candidates are in the final phase of clinical tests. Normally that would take two years to get there, maybe longer. And we expect to have a vaccine available before the end of the year, and maybe a lot sooner than that. To care for hard working Americans, we continue to deliver unprecedented financial support. We passed the largest relief package in history. Altogether, we’ve delivered over $3 trillion in economic assistance to the American people, and the American farmer has done very well. I never hear any complaints from the American farmer. I got $28 billion from China, I said, “You targeted our farmers in Iowa, in North Carolina, all over the country, Nebraska, you targeted our farmers. You can’t do that.” So I put big tariffs on goods coming in from China. And out of the many, many tens of billions of dollars that we took in, never happened to China before. They had the worst year they’ve had, last year before the plague, they had the worst year they’ve had in 67 years. So this never happened to them. I don’t want that to happen, I don’t want them to have a bad year, but nobody has ripped off our country more than them over the last 25 or 30 years. And we gave that money directly to the farmers, through Sonny, Department of Agriculture, we gave a total of $28 billion to farmers, and they’re not complaining, I’ll tell you, they’re not complaining. Nobody else, I can tell it to the farmers, I’ll tell it to the country, I’m very proud of it, nobody else, no other president would have done that. Even Sonny was surprised when I called him, I said, “Let’s do this.” Sonny said, “That’s never been done before,” but Sonny was okay with it, I will tell you. Thank you, darling, thank you very much. Through the paycheck protection program, we’ve saved 5 million small businesses and 50 million jobs. This includes nearly 130,000 small businesses and 1.2 million jobs right here in North Carolina. And you’re ready to open up. You got to tell the… And you’re ready to play football. You got to play football. You got to play football. We’ve delivered over $8 billion in economic impact payments directly to 5 million North Carolina families. And we provided a total of $19 billion to cover farmers’ losses due to the pandemic. And then we added another, we got it up to a total, the total was 28, and I guess we’re now up to 34 or close to 34. Nobody’s ever seen numbers like this. And it was really by putting tariffs on a place that treated us very, very badly. So it was 19 billion. It was 12 billion. It started off at 12, went to 19, went to 28. And I think it’s going to go probably up to about 34 billion. So our farmers will never be tormented again. We’ve slashed regulations to cut the death tax. Now the death tax is a big deal. So if you have a farm or a business like [Kirby 00:00:11:25], like your business, and you want to leave it to your beautiful family, which I just met, and they have to go out and get a big mortgage from a bank because they have big estate taxes, call it whatever you want, we call it a death tax. They don’t have to do that anymore, Kirby. That’s pretty good. Right? So you’ll be looking down and you’ll be saying, “They’re happy.” They won’t be losing the business or losing the farm, but we’ve slashed regulations, cut the death tax, the estate tax, got rid of it for the small farms and businesses. Provided direct assistance to farmers unfairly targeted by China and secured fair and reciprocal trade deals to boost American agricultural import and exports. You know, we have a very unfair situation going because some of our allies are much tougher than our enemies, if you want to know the truth, they put big tariffs on so you can’t get your product in. You can’t get it in. And I said, “That’s okay, you can put the tariffs in, but we’re going to put the same tariff on you.” And it’s amazing how quickly those tariffs come off, it’s really actually incredible to watch it. Already, the great American comeback is very much underway. So we’ve added the jobs in the United States. If you look at the stock market, it’s just about, in fact NASDAQ just set a new record, and it’s over a period of three weeks, it’s actually, I think, broken the record 14 or 15 times. And you’re going to see something with Dow, because you watch Dow, and you’re looking at the numbers, and we’re very close to breaking those records. When I left this morning, the stock market was up almost 300 points, we’ll see where it is. And that’s a leading indicator, that’s great stuff. That’s your 401ks, that’s your stocks. And the economy is quickly following wages are up nearly 5%. Retail spending is fully recovered and is at an all time high. Can you imagine that retail spending is now at a higher level than it was prior to the plague coming in? Can you believe that? I mean, who would think that? And home builder optimism is at a record high, and prices are going up, and homes are being built, and it’s an incredible thing that’s happening. And when we get rid of this virus, which will happen and it will happen sooner than people think, and that’s with the vaccines, but even without the vaccines, it’s happening. During this time of trial, we’ve seen once again that the strength of our nation lies in patriotic citizens like everyone here today, I’ve met so many of you, each time you deliver a food box to a family, you show them that in this country, no one is forgotten. Remember, I used to talk about the forgotten men and women of our country. And I still talk about them. You’ll be hearing about them on Thursday night, they are no longer forgotten. You’ve become a very, very important voice. Very important voice. They used to say, “Who are these people?” I said, “They’re the forgotten people. They work hard. They work so hard, and they’re the forgotten people.” Not any longer, they’re not. The Democrats are trying to find them, but they’re not being too good to the Democrats, I will say that. But together we’ll overcome the virus, and America will come back bigger, and better, and more united than ever before. We’ll be stronger. Or military is more powerful now than it ever was. We rebuilt entirely our military, $2.5 trillion. So I just want to thank you for the support. North Carolina, you’ve been incredible from, the first day I came to North Carolina. I was here many times before I did this political thing, but will tell you this was a great experience dealing with the people of North Carolina. And that’s why I felt I had an obligation to be here today, because we said we’re going to have our convention here. And it was because of your governor that we had to move things around, but we did already, we had a very important part of it in Charlotte. So I went there and I wanted to stop here and congratulate you on your success. And it’s a great honor. And I’ll introduce Sonny Perdue, Secretary of Agriculture. Thank you all very much. It’s a great honor. Thank you. Well, I want to also thank Mark Meadows and Deb for being incredible. You have somebody very capable going to be helping you out. But Mark has been a fantastic chief. We call them, chief of staff, we call him chief. But he’s done a great job and I appreciate it. And he loves your state. He loves your state, comes from your state, and he loves your state. Again, we will never take the word God out of our pledge of allegiance. As you saw, recently happened during the DNC caucus twice, at least twice. And that’ll never happen. And I just want to, again, thank all of the people of North Carolina very much. You’re very special people-who’ve had great. Thank you. And I will be seeing you very soon. November 3rd. I think it’s the most important election this country has ever had. November 3rd, get out and vote. Thank you very much everybody. Thank you.
















"
"44","08-27-20","Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Friends, delegates, and distinguished guests, please. I stand before you tonight honored by your support, proud of the extraordinary progress we have made together over the last four incredible years and blooming with confidence in the bright future we will build for America over the next four years. We begin this evening, our thoughts are with the wonderful people who have just come through the wrath of Hurricane Laura. We are working closely with state and local officials in Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, sparing no effort to save lives. While the hurricane was fierce, one of the strongest to make landfall in 150 years, the casualties and damage were far less than thought possible only 24 hours ago. And this is due to the great work of FEMA, law enforcement, and the individual states. I will be going this weekend. And congratulations, thank you for that great job out there. We really appreciate it. We are one national family, and we will always protect, love, and care for each other. Here tonight are the people who have made my journey possible and filled my life with so much joy. For her incredible service to our nation and its children, I want to thank our magnificent first lady. Thank you sweetheart. I also want to thank my amazing daughter Ivanka for that introduction, and to all of my children. Ivanka, please stand up. Thank you. And to all of my children and grandchildren, I love you more than words can express. I know my brother Robert is looking down on us right now from heaven. He was a great brother, and was very proud of the job we are all doing. Thank you. We love you, Robert. Let us also take a moment to show our profound appreciation for a man who has always fought by our side and stood up for our values, a man of deep faith and steadfast conviction, our vice president, Mike Pence. And Mike is joined by his beloved wife, a teacher and military mom, Karen Pence. Thank you, Karen. My fellow Americans, tonight, with a heart full of gratitude and boundless optimism, I profoundly accept this nomination for President of the United States. The Republican Party, the party of Abraham Lincoln, goes forward united, determined, and ready to welcome millions of Democrats, independents, and anyone who believes in the greatness of America and the righteous heart of the American people. In the new term as president, we will again build the greatest economy in history, quickly returning to full employment, soaring incomes and record prosperity. We will defend America against all threats and protect America against all dangers. We will lead America into new frontiers of ambition and discovery, and we will reach four new heights of national achievement. We will rekindle faith in our values, new pride in our history, and a new spirit of unity that can only be realized through love for our great country. Because we understand that America is not a land cloaked in darkness. America is the torch that enlightens the entire world. Gathered here at our beautiful and majestic White House, known all over the world as the people’s house, we cannot help but marvel at the miracle that is our great American story. This has been the home of larger-than-life figures like Teddy Roosevelt and Andrew Jackson, who rallied Americans to bold visions of a bigger and brighter future. Within these walls lived tenacious generals like President Grant and Eisenhower, who led our soldiers in the cause of freedom. From these grounds, Thomas Jefferson sent Lewis and Clark to chart our continent. In the depths of a bloody Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln looked out these very windows upon a half-completed Washington Monument and asked God and his Providence to save our nation. Two weeks after Pearl Harbor, Franklin Delano Roosevelt welcomed Winston Churchill, and just inside, they set our people on course to victory in the Second World War. In recent months, our nation and the entire planet has been struck by a new and powerful invisible enemy. Like those brave Americans before us, we are meeting this challenge. We are delivering lifesaving therapies and will produce a vaccine before the end of the year, or maybe even sooner. We will defeat the virus and the pandemic and emerge stronger than ever before. What united generations past was an unshakable confidence in America’s destiny and an unbreakable faith in the American people. They knew that our country is blessed by God and has a special purpose in this world. It is that conviction that inspired the formation of our union, our westward expansion, the abolition of slavery, the passage of civil rights, the space program and the overthrow of fascism, tyranny, and communism. This towering American spirit has prevailed over every challenge and has lifted us to the summit of human endeavor. And yet despite all of our greatness as a nation, everything we have achieved is now in danger. This is the most important election in the history of our country. Thank you. At no time before have voters faced a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies, or two agendas. This election will decide if we save the American dream or whether we allow a socialist agenda to demolish our cherished destiny. It will decide whether we rapidly create millions of high-paying jobs or whether we crush our industries and send millions of these jobs overseas, as has been foolishly done for many decades. Your vote will decide whether we protect law-abiding Americans or whether we give free rein to violent anarchists, and agitators, and criminals who threaten our citizens. And this election will decide whether we will defend the American way of life or whether we will allow a radical movement to completely dismantle and destroy it. That won’t happen. At the Democrat National Convention, Joe Biden and his party repeatedly assailed America as a land of racial, economic and social injustice. So tonight, I ask you a simple question, how can the Democratic Party ask to lead our country when it spent so much time tearing down our country? In the Left’s backward view, they do not see America as the most free, just, and exceptional nation on Earth. Instead, they see a wicked nation that must be punished for its sins. Our opponents say that redemption for you can only come from giving power to them. This is a tired anthem spoken by every repressive movement throughout history. But in this country, we don’t look to career politicians for salvation. In America, we do not turn to government to restore ourselves. We put our faith in almighty God. Joe Biden is not a savior of America’s soul. He is the destroyer of America’s jobs, and if given the chance, he will be the destroyer of America’s greatness. For 47 years, Joe Biden took the donations of blue-collar workers, gave them hugs, and even kisses, and told them he felt their pain, and then he flew back to Washington, and voted to ship our jobs to China and many other distant lands. Joe Biden spent his entire career outsourcing their dreams and the dreams of American workers, offshoring their jobs, opening their borders and sending their sons and daughters to fight in endless foreign wars, wars that never ended. Four years ago, I ran for president because I cannot watch this betrayal of our country any longer. I could not sit by as career politicians let other countries take advantage of us on trade, borders, foreign policy, and national defense. Our NATO partners, as an example, were very far behind in their defense payments. But at my strong urging, they agreed to pay $130 billion more a year, the first time in over 20 years that they upped their payments. And this $130 billion will ultimately go to $400 billion a year. And Secretary General Stoltenberg, who heads NATO, was amazed after watching for so many years, and said that President Trump did what no one else was able to do. Thank you. From the moment I left my former life behind, and it was a good life, I have done nothing but fight for you. I did what our political establishment never expected and could never forgive, breaking the cardinal rule of Washington politics. I kept my promise. Together we have ended the rule of the failed political class, and they are desperate to get their power back by any means necessary. You have seen that. They are angry at me because instead of putting them first, I very simply said, “America first.” Thank you. Days after taking office, we shocked the Washington establishment and withdrew from the last administration’s job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership. I then immediately approved the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, ended the unfair and very costly Paris Climate Accord, and secured, for the first time, American energy independence. We passed record-setting tax and regulation cuts at a rate nobody had ever seen before. Within three short years, we built the strongest economy in the history of the world. Washington insiders asked me not to stand up to China. They pleaded with me to let China continue stealing our jobs, ripping us off, and robbing our country blind. But I kept my word to the American people. We took the toughest, boldest, strongest, and hardest-hitting action against China in American history by far. They said that it would be impossible to terminate and replace NAFTA, but again they were wrong. Earlier this year, I ended the NAFTA nightmare and signed the brand-new Mexico-US-Canada agreement into law. And right now, auto companies and others are building their plants and factories in America, not firing their employees, and not deserting us for other countries. In perhaps no area did the Washington special interests try harder to stop us than on my policy of pro-American immigration. But I refused to back down, and today America’s borders are more secure than ever before. Thank you. We ended catch-and-release, stopped asylum fraud, took down human traffickers who prey on women and children, and we have deported 20000 gang members and 500000 criminal aliens. We have already built 300 miles of border wall, and we are adding 10 new miles every single week. The wall will soon be complete, and it is working beyond our wildest expectations. We are joined this evening by members of the Border Patrol Union, representing our country’s courageous border agents. Thank you very much for being here. Thank you. Brave, brave people. You see, this country loves our law enforcement. They do. They really do. Love and respect. When I learned that the Tennessee Valley Authority laid off hundreds of American workers and forced them to train their lower-paid foreign replacements, I promptly removed the chairman of the board. And now those talented American workers have been rehired, and are back providing power to Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Virginia. They have their old jobs back, and some are here with us this evening. Please stand. You went through a lot. Please stand. Thank you. Thank you very much. You’ve been through a lot. Thank you very much. Last month, I took on big pharma. You think that’s easy? It’s not. And signed orders that would massively lower the cost of your prescription drugs, and give critically ill patients access to lifesaving cures. We passed the decades-long-awaited right to try. We also passed VA Accountability and VA Choice, our great veterans, we’re taking care of our veterans. 91% approval rating this month, the VA given by our veterans. First time anything like that has ever happened. By the end of my first term, we will have approved more than 300 federal judges, including two great new Supreme Court justices. And to bring prosperity to our forgotten inner cities, we worked hard to pass historic criminal justice reform, prison reform, opportunity zones, and long-term funding of historically Black colleges and universities. And before the China virus came in, produced the best unemployment numbers for African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and Asian-Americans ever recorded. And I say very modestly that I have done more for the African-American community than any president since Abraham Lincoln, our first Republican president. And I have done more in three years for the Black community than Joe Biden has done in 47 years. And when I am re-elected, the best is yet to come. Thank you very much. When I took office, the Middle East was in total chaos. ISIS was rampaging, Iran was on the rise, and the war in Afghanistan had no end in sight. I withdrew from the terrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal. Unlike many presidents before me, I kept my promise, recognized Israel’s true capital, and moved our Embassy to Jerusalem. But not only did we talk about it as a future site, we got it built. Rather than spending $1 billion on a new building as planned, we took an already owned, existing building in a better location. Real estate deal, right? And opened it at a cost of less than $500000. Many things like that the government is doing right now. We also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. And this month we achieved the first Middle East peace deal in 25 years. Thank you to the UAE. Thank you to Israel. In addition, we obliterated 100% of the ISIS caliphate, and killed its founder and leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Then, in a separate operation, we eliminated the world’s number-one terrorist by far, Qassim Suleimani. Unlike previous administrations, I have kept America out of new wars, and our troops are coming home. We have spent nearly $2.5 trillion on completely rebuilding our military, which was very badly depleted when I took office, as you know. This includes three separate pay raises for our great warriors. We also launched the Space Force, the first new branch of the United States Military since the Air Force was created almost 75 years ago. We have spent the last four years reversing the damage Joe Biden inflicted over the last 47 years. Biden’s record is a shameful roll call of the most catastrophic betrayals and blunders in our lifetime. He has spent his entire career on the wrong side of history. Biden voted for the NAFTA disaster, the single worst trade deal ever enacted. He supported China’s entry into the World Trade Organization, one of the greatest economic disasters of all time. After those Biden calamities, the United States lost one in four manufacturing jobs. We laid off workers in Michigan, Ohio, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and many other states. They did not want to hear Biden’s hollow words of empathy. They wanted their jobs back. As vice president, he supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would have been a death sentence for the US auto industry. He backed the horrendous South Korea trade deal, which took many jobs from our country, and which I’ve reversed and made a great deal for our country. He repeatedly supported mass amnesty for illegal immigrants. He voted for the Iraq war. He opposed the mission that took out Osama bin Laden. He opposed killing Suleimani, he oversaw the rise of ISIS, and cheered the rise of China as a positive development for America and the world. Some positive development. That is why China supports Joe Biden, and desperately wants him to win. I can tell you that upon very good information. China would own our country if Joe Biden got elected. Unlike Biden, I will hold them fully accountable for the tragedy that they caused all over the world, they caused. In recent months, our nation and the world has been hit by the once-in-a-century pandemic that China allowed to spread around the globe. They could have stopped it, but they allowed it to come out. We are grateful to be joined tonight by several of our incredible nurses and first responders. Please stand and accept our profound thanks and gratitude. Many Americans, including me, I have sadly lost friends and cherished loved ones to this horrible disease. As one nation, we mourn, we grieve, and we hold in our hearts forever the memories of all of those lives that have been so tragically taken so unnecessary. In their honor, we unite. In their memory, we will overcome it. And when the China virus hit, we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II, invoking the Defense Production Act. We produce the world’s largest supply of ventilators. Not a single American who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator, which is a miracle. Good job heading the task force by our great vice president. Thank you very much, Mike. Please stand up. We shipped hundreds of millions of masks, gloves, and gowns to our frontline health care workers. To protect our nation’s seniors, we rushed supplies, testing kits, and personnel to nursing homes. We gave everything you can possibly give, and we’re still giving it because we are taking care of our senior citizens. The Army Corps of Engineers built field hospitals, and the Navy deployed our great hospital ships. We developed from scratch the largest and most advanced testing system anywhere in the world. America has tested more than every country in Europe put together, and more than every nation in the western hemisphere combined, think of that. We have conducted 40 million more tests than the next closest nation, which is India. We developed a wide array of effective treatments, including a powerful antibody treatment known as convalescent plasma. You saw that? On Sunday night when we announced it. That will save thousands and thousands of lives. Thanks to advances, we have pioneered the fatality rates. And you look at it, and you look at the numbers, it has been reduced by 80% since April. 80%. The United States has among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country anywhere in the world. The European Union’s case fatality rate is nearly three times higher than ours, but you don’t hear that. They do not write about that. They don’t want to write about that. They do not want you to know those things. Altogether, the nations of Europe have experienced a 30% greater increase in excess mortality than the United States. Think of that. We enacted the largest package of financial relief in American history. Thanks to our Paycheck Protection Program, we have saved or supported more than 50 million American jobs. That’s one of the reasons that we’re advancing so rapidly with our economy. Great job. As a result, we have seen the smallest economic contraction of any major western nation. And we are recovering at a much faster rate than anybody. Over the past three months, we have gained over nine million jobs, and that’s a record in the history of our country. Unfortunately, from the beginning, our opponents have shown themselves capable of nothing but a partisan ability to criticize. When I took bold action to issue a travel ban on China, very early indeed, Joe called it hysterical and xenophobic. And then I introduced a ban on Europe, very early again. If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died. Instead of following the science, Joe Biden wants to inflict a painful shutdown on the entire country. His shutdown would inflict unthinkable and lasting harm on our nation’s children, families, and citizens of all backgrounds. The cost of the Biden shutdown would be measured in increased drug overdoses, depression, alcohol addiction, suicides, heart attacks, economic devastation, job loss, and much more. Joe Biden’s plan is not a solution to the virus, but rather it’s a surrender to the virus. My administration has a very different approach. To save as many lives as possible, we are focusing on the science, the facts, and the data. We are aggressively sheltering those at highest risk, especially the elderly, while allowing lower-risk Americans to safely return to work and to school. And we want to see so many of those great states be opened by Democrats. We want them to be open. They have to be open. They have to get back to work. They have to get back to work, and they have to get back to school. Most importantly, we are marshaling America’s scientific genius to produce a vaccine in record time. Under Operation Warp Speed, we have three different vaccines in the final stage of trials right now, years ahead of what has been achieved before. Nobody thought it could be done this fast. Normally it would be years, and we did it in a matter of a few months. We are producing them in advance so that hundreds of millions of doses will be quickly available. We will have a safe and effective vaccine this year, and together we will crush the virus. At the Democrat convention, you barely heard a word about their agenda. But that is not because they don’t have one. It is because their agenda is the most extreme set of proposals ever put forward by a major party nominee. Joe Biden may claim he is an ally of the light. But when it comes to his agenda, Biden wants to keep us completely in the dark. He doesn’t have a clue. He has pledged a $4 trillion tax hike on almost all American families, which would totally collapse our rapidly improving economy, and once again record stock markets that we have right now, will also collapse. That means your 401(k)s, that means all of the stocks that you have. On the other hand, just as I did in my first term, I will cut taxes even further for hardworking moms and dads. I will not raise taxes, I will cut them, and very substantially. And we will also provide tax credits to bring jobs out of China, back to America. And we will impose tariffs on any company that leaves America to produce jobs overseas. We will make sure our companies and jobs stay in our country, as I’ve already been doing for quite some time if you’ve noticed. Joe Biden’s agenda is made in China. My agenda is made in the USA. Biden has promised to abolish the production of American oil, coal, shale, and natural gas, laying waste to the economies of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Texas, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Colorado, and New Mexico, destroying those states, absolutely destroying those states and others. Millions of jobs will be lost, and energy prices will soar. These same policies led to crippling power outages in California just last week. Everybody saw that. Tremendous power outage. Nobody’s seen anything like it, but we saw it last week in California. How can Joe Biden claim to be an ally of the light when his own party can’t even keep the lights on? Joe Biden’s campaign has even published a 110-page policy platform. You can’t get away from this, co-authored with far-left senator, crazy Bernie Sanders. The Biden-Bernie manifesto[ calls for suspending all removals of illegal aliens, implementing nationwide catch-and-release, and providing illegal aliens with free taxpayer-funded lawyers. Everybody gets a lawyer. Come over to our country, everybody has a lawyer. We have a lawyer for you. That’s all we need, is more lawyers. Joe Biden recently raised his hand on the debate stage, and promised he was going to give it away your health care dollars to illegal immigrants, which is going to bring massive number of immigrants into our country. Massive numbers will pour into our country in order to get all the goodies that they want to give. Education, health care, everything. He also supports deadly sanctuary cities that protect criminal aliens. He promised to end national security travel bans from jihadist nations, and he pledged to increase refugee admissions by 700%. This is in the manifesto. The Biden plan would eliminate America’s borders in the middle of a global pandemic. And he is even talking about taking the wall down. How about that? Biden also vowed to oppose school choice, and close all charter schools, ripping away the ladder of opportunity for Black and Hispanic children. In a second term, I will expand charter schools, and provide school choice to every family in America. And we will always treat our teachers with the tremendous respect that they deserve. Great people. Great, great people. Joe Biden claims he has empathy for the vulnerable, yet the party he leads supports the extreme late-term abortion of defenseless babies, right up until the moment of birth. Democrat leaders talk about moral decency, but they have no problem with stopping a baby’s beating heart in the ninth month of pregnancy. Democrat politicians refuse to protect innocent life, and then they lecture us about morality and saving America’s soul. Tonight, we proudly declare that all children, born and unborn, have a God-given right to life. During the Democrat convention, the words, under God, were removed from the Pledge of Allegiance. Not once, but twice. We will never do that. But the fact is, this is where they’re coming from. Like it or not, this is where they’re coming from. If the Left gains power, they will demolish the suburbs, confiscate your guns, and appoint justices who will wipe away your Second Amendment and other constitutional freedoms. Biden is a Trojan horse for socialism. If Joe Biden doesn’t have the strength to stand up to wild-eyed Marxists like Bernie Sanders and his fellow radicals, and there are many, there are many. We see them all the time. It is incredible, actually. Then how is he ever going to stand up for you? He’s not. The most dangerous aspect of the Biden platform is the attack on public safety. The Biden-Bernie manifesto calls for abolishing cash bail, immediately releasing 400000 criminals onto the streets and into your neighborhoods. When asked if he supports cutting police funding, Joe Biden replied, “Yes, absolutely.” When Congresswoman Ilhan Omar called the Minneapolis Police Department, “A cancer that is rotten to the root,” Biden would not disavow her support and reject her endorsement. He proudly displayed it shortly later on his website, displayed it in big letters. Make no mistake, if you give power to Joe Biden, the Radical Left will defund police departments all across America. They will pass federal legislation to reduce law enforcement nationwide. They will make every city look like Democrat-run Portland, Oregon. No one will be safe in Biden’s America. My administration will always stand with the men and women of law enforcement. Every day, police officers risk their lives to keep us safe, and every year many sacrifice their lives in the line of duty. One of these incredible Americans was Detective Miosotis Familia. She was part of a team of American heroes called the NYPD, or New York’s finest, who I was very proud to get their endorsement just the other day. Great people. If they were allowed to do their job, you’d have no crime in New York. Rudy Giuliani knows that better than anybody. Thank you, Rudy. Three years ago on the Fourth of July weekend, Detective Familia was on duty in her vehicle when she was ambushed just after midnight, and murdered by a monster who hated her purely for wearing the badge. Detective Familia was a single mom. She recently asked for the night shift so she could spend more time with her kids. Two years ago, I stood in front of the US Capitol alongside those beautiful children, and held their grandmother’s hand as they mourned their terrible loss. And we honored Detective Familia’s extraordinary life. It was extraordinary. Detective Familia’s three children are with us this evening. Genesis, Peter, Delilah, we are so grateful to have you here tonight. Thank you very much for coming. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. I promise you that we will treasure your mom in our memories forever. We must remember that the overwhelming majority of police officers in this country, and that’s the overwhelming majority, are noble, courageous, and honorable. We have to give law enforcement, our police, back their power. They are afraid to act. They are afraid to lose their pension. They are afraid to lose their jobs. And by being afraid, they are not able to do the job that they so desperately want to do for you. And those who suffer most are the great people who they protect, and who they want to protect at an even higher level. When there is police misconduct, the justice system must hold wrongdoers fully and completely accountable, and it will. But when we can never have a situation where things are going on as they are today, we must never allow mob rule. We can never allow mob rule. In the strongest possible terms, the Republican Party condemns the rioting, looting, arson, and violence we have seen in Democrat-run cities all, like Kenosha, Minneapolis, Portland, Chicago, and New York, and many others, Democrat-run. There is violence and danger in the streets of many Democrat-run cities throughout America. This problem could easily be fixed if they wanted to. Just call, we’re ready to go in. We will take care of your problem in a matter of hours. Just call. We have to wait for the call. It is too bad we have to, but we have to wait for the call. We must always have law and order. All federal crimes are being investigated, prosecuted, and punished to the fullest extent of the law. When the anarchists started ripping down our statues and monuments right outside, I signed an order immediately, 10 years in prison, and it was a miracle. It all stopped. No more statues. They said, “That’s just too long,” as they looked at a statue. “I think we’ll rip it down.” Then they said, “10 years in prison? I think that is too long. Let’s go home.” During their convention, Joe Biden and his supporters remained completely silent about the rioters and criminals spreading mayhem in Democrat-run cities. They never even mentioned it during their entire convention. Never once mentioned. Now, they are starting to mention it because their poll numbers are going down like a rock in water. It is too late, Joe. In the face of left-wing anarchy and mayhem in Minneapolis, Chicago, and other cities, Joe Biden’s campaign did not condemn it. They donated to it. At least 13 members of Joe Biden’s campaign staff donated to a fund to bailout vandals, arsonists, anarchists, looters, and rioters from jail. Here tonight is the grieving family of retired police captain, David Dorn, a 38-year veteran of the St. Louis Police Department, a great man and a highly respected man by all. In June, Captain Dorn was shot and killed as he tried to protect a store from rioters and looters, or as the Democrats would call them, peaceful protesters. They call them peaceful protesters. We are honored to be joined tonight by his wonderful wife Ann, and beloved family members, Brian and Kielen. To each of you, we will never forget the heroic legacy of Captain. David Dorn. Thank you very much for being here. Thank you very much. Great man. As long as I am president, we will defend the absolute right of every American citizen to live in security, dignity, and peace. If the Democrat Party wants to stand with anarchists, agitators, rioters, looters, and flag burners, that is up to them. But I as your president, will not be part of it. The Republican Party will remain the voice of the patriotic heroes who keep America safe and salute the American flag. Last year, over 1000 African-Americans were murdered as a result of violent crime in just four Democrat-run cities. The top 10 most dangerous cities in the country are run by Democrats, and have been for many decades. Thousands more African-Americans are victim and victims of violent crime in these communities. Joe Biden and the Left ignore these American victims. I never will. If the radical Left takes power, they will apply their disastrous policies to every town, city, and suburb in America. Just imagine if the so-called peaceful demonstrators in the streets were in charge of every lever of power in the US government. Just think of that. Liberal politician’s claim to be concerned about the strength of American institutions. But who exactly is attacking them? Who is hiring the radical professors, judges, and prosecutors? Who is trying to abolish immigration enforcement and establish speech codes designed to muzzle dissent? In every case, the attacks on American institutions are being waged by Radical Left. Always remember, they are coming after me because I am fighting for you. That is what is happening. And it has been going on from before I even got elected. And remember this, they spied on my campaign, and they got caught. Let’s see now what happens. We must reclaim our independence from the Left’s repressive mandates. Americans are exhausted, trying to keep up with the latest lists of approved words and phrases, and the ever more restrictive political decrees. Many things have a different name now, and the rules are constantly changing. The goal of Cancel Culture is to make Americans live in fear of being fired, expelled, shamed, humiliated, and driven from society as we know it. The far-left wants to coerce you into saying what you know to be false, and scare you out of saying what you know to be true. Very sad. But on November 3rd, you can send them a very thundering message they will never forget. Joe Biden is weak. He takes his marching orders from liberal hypocrites who drive their cities into the ground while fleeing from the scene of the wreckage. The same liberals want to eliminate school choice while they enroll their children into the finest private schools in the land. They want to open our borders while living in walled off compounds and communities and the best neighborhoods in the world. They want to defund the police while they have armed guards for themselves. This November, we must turn the page forever on this failed political class. The fact is, I am here. What is the name of that building? But I’ll say it differently, the fact is, we are here and they are not. To me, one of the most beautiful buildings anywhere in the world is not a building, it is a home, as far as I am concerned. It’s not even a house, it is a home. It’s a wonderful place with an incredible history. But it is all because of you. Together, we will write the next chapter of the great American story. Over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. We will expand opportunity zones. Thank you, Tim Scott. Bring home our medical supply chains. And we will end our resilience for banned things. We will go right after China. We will not rely on them one bit. We are taking our business out of China. We are bringing it home. We want our business to come home. We will continue to reduce taxes and regulations at levels not seen before. We will create 10 million jobs in the next 10 months. And it will be higher than that. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, and surge federal prosecutors into high-crime communities. We will ban deadly sanctuary cities, and ensure federal health care is protected for American citizens, not for illegal aliens. We will have strong borders. And I’ve said for years, without borders, we don’t have a country. We don’t have a country. Strike down terrorists who threaten our people, and keep America out of endless and costly foreign wars. We will appoint prosecutors, judges, justices who believe in enforcing the law, not enforcing their own political agenda, which is illegal. We will ensure equal justice for citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed. We will uphold your religious liberty, and defend your Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. And if we don’t win, your Second Amendment doesn’t have a chance. I can tell you that. I have totally protected it. We will protect Medicare and Social Security. We will always and very strongly protect patients with pre-existing conditions, and that is a pledge from the entire Republican Party. Thank you, Kevin. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency, and further reduce the cost of prescription drugs and health insurance premiums. They are coming way down. We will greatly expand energy development, continuing to remain the number-one in the world, and keep America energy independent. And for those of you that still drive a car, look how low your gasoline bill is. You haven’t seen that in a long time. We will win the race to 5G, and build the world’s best cyber and missile defense, already under construction. We will fully restore patriotic education to our schools and always protect. We will always, always protect free speech on college campuses. And we put a very big penalty in, if they do anything having to do with your free speech, colleges have to pay a tremendous, tremendous financial penalty. And again, it is amazing how open they have been lately. We will launch a new age of American ambition in space. America will land the first woman on the moon, and the United States will be the first nation to plant its beautiful flag on Mars. This is the unifying national agenda that will bring our country together. So tonight, I say to all Americans, this is the most important election in the history of our country. There has never been such a difference between two parties or two individuals in ideology, philosophy, or vision than there is right now. Our opponents believe that America is a depraved nation. We want our sons and daughters to know the truth. America is the greatest and most exceptional nation in the history of the world. Our country wasn’t built by Cancel Culture, speech codes, and crushing conformity. We are not a nation of timid spirits. We are a nation of fierce, proud, and independent American patriots. We are a nation of pilgrims, pioneers, adventurers, explorers, and trailblazers who refuse to be tied down, held back, or in any way reigned in. Americans have steel in their spines, grit in their souls, and fire in their hearts. There is no one like us on Earth. I want every child in America to know that you are part of the most exciting and incredible adventure in human history. No matter where your family comes from, no matter your background in America, anyone can rise. With hard work, devotion, and drive, you can reach any goal and achieve every ambition. Our American ancestors sailed across the perilous ocean to build a new life on a new continent. They braved the freezing winters, crossed the raging rivers, scaled the rocky peaks, trekked the dangerous forests, and worked from dawn till dusk. These pioneers didn’t have money. They didn’t have fame. But they had each other. They loved their families, they loved their country, and they loved their God. When opportunity beckoned, they picked up their bibles, packed up their belongings, climbed into their covered wagons, and set out West for the next adventure. Ranchers and miners, cowboys and sheriffs, farmers and settlers. They pressed on past the Mississippi to stake a claim in the wild frontier. Legends were born. Wyatt Earp, Annie Oakley, Davy Crockett, and Buffalo Bill. Americans built their beautiful homesteads on the open range. Soon, they had churches and communities, then towns, and with time, great centers of industry and commerce. That is who they were. Americans build their future, we don’t tear down our past. We are the nation that won a revolution, toppled tyranny and fascism, and delivered millions into freedom. We laid down the railroads, built the great ships, raised up the skyscrapers, revolutionized industry, and sparked a new age of scientific discovery. We set the trends in art and music, radio and film, sport and literature. And we did it all with style and confidence and flair, because that is who we are. Whenever our way of life was threatened, our heroes answered the call. From Yorktown to Gettysburg, from Normandy to Iwo Jima, American patriots raced into cannon blasts, bullets, and bayonets to rescue American liberty. They had no fear. But America did not stop there. We looked into the sky and kept pressing onward. We built a six-million-pound rocket and launched it thousands of miles into space. We did it so two brave patriots could stand tall and salute our wondrous American flag planted on the face of the moon. For America, nothing is impossible. Over the next four years, we will prove worthy of this magnificent legacy. We will reach stunning new heights, and we will show that the world for America there is a dream, and it is not beyond your reach. Together, we are unstoppable. Together, we are unbeatable. Because together, we are the proud citizens of the United States of America. On November 3rd, we will make America safer. We will make America stronger. We will make America prouder. And we will make America greater than ever before. I am very proud to be the nominee of the Republican Party. I love you all. God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you very much.

"45","08-28-20","Hello, everybody. Hello, everybody. Wow. Hello, everybody. Thank you. Thank you. And I’ll tell you, we’re landing and there are thousands of people along the runways, and I said, “Why aren’t they here?” “Sir, we couldn’t let them in.” “Why not? Let’s let them in.” Oh, these people. And then they put in a floor. This is for Manchester because you know about flooring. They put in a floor that’s like an ice skating rink. So we’re going to tiptoe around. How are you, everybody? We love you. We love you. Great, great people. Manchester, we had some good memories in Manchester. 2016, but this is going to be, we are right now in the most important election in our history. But I’m thrilled to be back in the Granite State with the true hard-working American Patriots. Last night it was my great honor to accept the Republican nomination for President of the United States. We’re going to win. We’re going to win. Does anybody have any doubt? Does anybody… It’s very interesting, last night we had an incredible time and I don’t know if you know, it’s driving the fake news crazy. They’re back. But the poll numbers have swung. If you go back six months before the plague flew in from China, the plague, the horrible plague, this election was over. This election was over. And then I had to go back to work. I had to go back to work. And then I went back to work and we’ve done an incredible job in every aspect of running government, but I also had to start campaigning a little bit again, and I did. And today it was announced that Joe Biden is coming out of the basement. Because the poll numbers have totally swung. They totally swung. And they’ve swung like nobody’s ever seen them swing before. And it was rapid. It was a rapid swing. Because they all admit that we’re doing a great job. There’s not too many presidents that have done a job like we’ve done, including keeping you out of wars, bringing you home from the endless wars. But they’ve swung. But here’s what I don’t get. Sleepy Joe’s coming out he said in 10 days, that’s a long… 10 days. 10 days. That’s like an eternity in Trumpville. 10 days. I view 10 days is like an eternity, okay? So he decided he’s coming out and he’s going to be out in 10 days. That’s a long time. That’s a big percentage of the remaining time. That’s all right, he’s much better off where he is. I think he’s, I think he just…We love Melania, we do. She did a great job. Did a great job. She did a great job. She went up on Tuesday night, did an incredible job. Last night was exciting, wasn’t it? And how about those stories from friends of mine? How about those stories? Was that just compelling and incredible television, but really that was an exciting, a really good quality convention. Really great. So many people. So many people, you saw some tragic situations, some really great endorsements, you saw everything. If you… How about the endorsement of Herschel Walker? When you watch that that was from the heart. That was from the heart. Dana White today. I just saw it today because last night I was looking at this speech a little bit. We had a wonderful turnout last night. What I didn’t like, you saw this right, when it was over, you saw when it was over? The thugs outside because the Democratic mayor of Washington DC, it’s another Democrat that’s not believing in law and order. And you know we give Washington DC a lot of money to run it, but they don’t do a good job of running it. The mayor, she doesn’t run anything. And these incredible people from all over the country, all over the world that were there last night, they walked out to a bunch of thugs. And that wasn’t, remember this, that wasn’t friendly protesters. They were thugs. They were thugs. And the DC police are good, but the mayor gave bad instructions last night, that should have never been allowed to happen. When a senator like Rand Paul walks out, and thank God we had some good police around him and they took a tremendous… They took tremendous abuse. And Rand Paul was in big trouble last night, he’s a good guy, he’s a friend of mine, and that shouldn’t happen to anybody. But he is a US senator walking outside and those four policemen should be brought over to the White House and we ought to give them a medal of some kind, and we’re going to do it. We’re going to do it. I told that to Rand. And the mayor should be ashamed of herself for that kind of a display of incompetence because that’s what’s happening in Portland. And that’s what’s happening all over where you have Democrat-run cities. Just take a look. And we’re looking at the whole situation in DC, and tonight they have a lot of people gathering, let’s see how that works out. They have to be able to manage their affairs, they get a lot of money. She’s always looking for money, “Could we have more money?” “What are you going to waste it on? I mean spend it on. What are you going to waste it on, Mayor?” And then our people walk out, and these are people from all over the world, they walk, including Congress, by the way, they walk out and they get accosted, they get abused, they get spit on. It’s a disgrace. And our country is going to change. We’re not going to allow that to happen. You know, we’re not supposed to be… We’re not supposed to be involved unless we’re invited in by the people that run, these are all Democrat cities, just so you understand, including DC. So we’re not supposed to go in unless we call it an insurrection, but that’s a big statement. It’s a big statement. No reason for it. But you know what we’re going to do? We’re going to have to look at it. Mark Meadows is here, we’re going to have to look at it because we’re not going to let that happen to people that go to the White House to celebrate our country. And a weak guy named Joe Biden, and he’s weak, he’s weak as hell, a weak guy like Joe Biden didn’t even bring law and order up as a subject for discussion in the entire Democrat National Convention. Now they’re all of a sudden… Now they realize because they’ve gone down like a rock in water, they’ve gone down in the polls and now all of a sudden they’re talking all, “Well, we have to talk about crime.” Number one, they have no… Look at what happened to New York, look at what’s going on in Chicago, all Democrats, all radical left Democrats. Look at what’s going on in the great State of Wisconsin. Now I will tell you, two days ago we sent in the National Guard. That was the end of that problem. Look at Portland. We want to send in the National Guard, we sent in Homeland Security just to protect our… couple of our buildings, including a courthouse, can you believe it? We sent in because they can’t protect it. So we sent, they did a very effective job. We could take care of Portland in 45 minutes, 45 minutes. If that governor, if that mayor would call and say, “Please send in the National Guard.” just like … Hey, we did it in Minneapolis. Remember that? The place was going to burn down. Another few days, we send in the National Guard, it was over within an hour. They ought to get smart and that’s what they ought to do. So now they’re talking about, “Well, we want to …” Why did they call it a friendly protest? Right? Remember the idiot from CNN, he’s standing there. This is a friendly protest. Behind him over his shoulders, the entire city is burning down. Sixty seven days from now, we’re going to win the great state of New Hampshire. We have to. We’re going to win four more years in the White House. Within my first term in office, we’ve secured America’s borders, brought back our manufacturing jobs, rebuilt the United States military. It was a mess. It was a depleted mess. Wiped out the ISIS caliphate, killed our terrorists enemies, kept America out of foolish, stupid, ridiculous foreign wars. Achieved American energy independence. You see the price of your gasoline. When you go fill it up, “Oh boy, that’s a nice price.” It’s half what it was. We built the single greatest economy in the history of the world. That includes China, which was having a very, very bad year. Then the plague came in from China. We had to close it up. We saved millions of lives and now we’re open again and we’re setting records. We’re setting records. Wait till you see the numbers just before the election. There’ll be released and this is despite the fact that the Democrats are holding back Michigan, North Carolina. You take a look. Pennsylvania. They want to keep them. By the way, on November 4th, regardless, they’ll be opening them up, November 4th, because they think that hurts the economy and that will hurt me, but our numbers are going to be great. We’re going to have a great third quarter. We’re going to have an unbelievable next year, unless somebody stupid gets elected and raises your taxes. This November, each of you will vote in truly the most important election in the history of our country. I used to say it about 2016. This is now at a new level. Joe Biden is the puppet of the radical left movement that seeks to obliterate and destroy everything that you hold here including your second amendment, which will have no chance. Your vote will decide whether we save the American dream or whether we allow Biden to eliminate your jobs. By the way, it’s not Biden. It’s not Biden. It’s his masters, his … They tell him what to do, his masters. They want to erase your borders, confiscate your guns, appoint radical left judges and prosecutors, tear down our history. Demolish your suburbs. You saw what I did. I ended the rule. You’re not going to have low income housing built in your suburbs anymore, but nobody writes that because the fake news doesn’t want to write that, but everyone knows. Unless our friends in the suburbs have gotten a lot dumber than they used to be, they know that. They want to destroy your suburbs, indoctrinate our children, defund the police and try everything in the book to turn our cities so that they look more like Portland, Oregon than what we’re used to looking at. Never forget, they are coming after me because I am fighting for you. It’s true. Today’s Democrat party is filled with hate. Just look at Joe Biden supporters on the streets screaming and shouting at bystanders with unhinged manic rage. Right? You see it. It’s crazy. It’s crazy. You ought to see last night in Washington. It was a disgrace. It was a disgrace that these people are representing the United States of America. It was a disgrace. Protesters. You know what I say? Protest is your ass. I don’t talk about my ass. They’re not protestors. Those aren’t … Those are anarchists. They’re agitators. They’re rioters. They’re looters. They’re not … You know you say that and some of the people, not all of them, but some of the people back there, “Oh, how dare you. These are friendly protesters, right?” Friendly …They’re just looking for trouble. Has nothing to do with George Floyd. Has nothing to do with anything. They don’t even know who George Floyd is. Okay? They don’t know who George Floyd. They have no idea. If you ask them, “Who’s George Floyd?” They couldn’t even tell you. These are just bad people, troublemakers and they shouldn’t be representing our country at important events and we’ve got to stop it. Democrats have no complaint about the rioters and the vandals, marauding through our cities or mass unruly demonstrations, but they don’t believe law abiding citizens can go to a church together. You can’t go to church anymore. You know how many churches are closed in this country because of the Democrats? You can go out and you can have thousands of people marauding through the streets, threatening other people, beyond threatening, kicking them in the face, doing what they’ve done. You’ve seen it. They would have done that to Senator Rand Paul last night. He’d either be in very bad shape or dead and that would include his wife if those policemen didn’t happen to be there. They took some big beating. The reason they didn’t fight back too much, they don’t want to lose their pension. They don’t want to lose their job, because we’ve become so politically correct, everybody’s afraid to do anything now, but they did a good job. The puppet Biden, who’s just controlled so strongly wants you to cancel weddings, funerals and school, but has no problem with thousands of so-called peaceful protesters cramming into your streets, mugging people, hurting people, robbing stores, looting stores, burning down storefronts. The radical left will do anything to get power. They smear justice, Brett Kavanaugh, and they are … Did you see anything like that? Justice Kavanaugh. People forget. Time goes by, they forget. We don’t forget. I don’t forget. They’re destroying the livelihoods of innocent people and if Biden wins, which I honestly can’t believe can happen. I will have lost to a low IQ individual. I don’t want that. I don’t want it. Sleepy Joe, I don’t want it. But the agitators will go from rioting in the streets to running the halls of government. Can you believe it? The levers, they call it the levers of government. The top 10 most dangerous cities in America are run by Democrats and have been for decades. Now they’re trying to impose those policies across the entire country. No one will be safe in Biden’s America. I can’t even call it Biden’s America. God doesn’t know he’s alive. He’s going to be out in 10 days. He’s going to start 10 days. Ten days. I mean, I gave a big speech last night. I said, “What am I doing tomorrow night?” You’re going to New Hampshire, but sir, we can cancel New Hampshire because you had a big night. We can cancel. Are you crazy? I don’t have the courage to cancel New Hampshire. I got to win New Hampshire. I love the people and you’ve been very good to me. You’ve been very good to me. You’ve been very good to me. So, New Hampshire was the first state I won. Right? Remember, I came here. I was very excited. That was an exciting evening. That was an exciting race, but we don’t talk about that anymore. We have to talk about the future. We don’t talk about it. That was great. It was important. We’ve done more than any administration in its first three and a half years in the history of our country. That’s despite phony witch hunts, phony investigations, a phony impeachment based on a phone call that was absolutely perfect. That’s despite a pandemic that was probably sent in by China, who the hell knows how it got here and all over the world, because China does not want to see me win I can tell you that. We’re not happy with China. I’ll tell you why. If Biden got in, China would own the United States very quickly. They’d own it. If the Democrat party wants to stand with anarchist, criminals, rioters, looters, and flag burners, that’s up to them. The Republican party and you, I can see you. Is there anybody in this place that enjoys burning the American flag? Is there anybody? Please quietly raise your hand. Be careful. Could be very dangerous. The Republican party will remain the voice of the patriotic heroes who keep America safe and our law enforcement. Right? We are all that stand between the American people and the left wing mob. If you want to save democracy from the mob, then you must vote to defeat an extremely poor candidate. Look, I believe I have the honor of running against the worst candidate ever put up by the Democratic party, the worst. How do you get worse? I believe he’s the worst candidate, the slowest candidate. I mean, in prime time, he was the slowest candidate, which was a long time ago. Primetime. You know what I don’t like though, they say he’s like 78, 79, 78, I guess. Right? I know people that are 85, that are 88, 92, Bernie Marcus, Home Depot, he’s 92 years old. He’s the sharpest guy you’ll ever meet. There’s nothing … 78 is okay, but that’s a bad 78, not a good 78. 78 is okay, but he shouldn’t say that. They shouldn’t say … The press, they say he’s too old. He’s not too old. He’s not too old, but 78 is okay, but I do. I know people in their 90s that are 100% sharp and good physically, actually good physically. You want debate? So do I. I want debates too. I want debates too. Tonight, we’re honored to be joined by New Hampshire House Republican leader, Dick Hinch. Where is Dick? I think your great governor is here. Where’s the governor? Where’s our governor? Hi, Dick. Good job. Do we like Dick? Yes. Where’s our governor? He’s here. He just met me. I told him, “Go back.” Hi, Steve. Because you have a great governor and we don’t have same day voting anymore. We don’t have same day. What a joke that was last time, remember? Buses poured up from Massachusetts with a lot of people that weren’t going to vote for Trump, and they poured up thousands and thousands of people came in on election day and then you had a senator running on the Republican party who wasn’t exactly the greatest for us, but we have done so well here and we’re going to have a big win. I’m hearing we’re going to have a great win. So, I want to thank you, governor. Also with us, our state representatives, Al Baldasaro and Fred Doucette. Where are you? Hi. Hi, Al. I know these guys so well. Hey Al, have I taken care of the vets better than you even thought? This guy I met him. He’s a big vet. He wanted the vets. He didn’t care about anything else, but the vets. Honestly, he couldn’t have cared less about anybody here except the vets, but I did a good job, right? We did a good job for the vets. Very importantly, very, very US Senate candidate Corky Messner. Good, Corky. I hear you’re doing well. Good, Corky. Get them. We need Corky. Get them. I hear you’re doing well, Corky. Congressional candidate Matt Mowers. Matt, thank you. Thank you, Matt. Great people. A friend of mine for a long time, he said right from the beginning, “You’re going to win this state, sir.” We met him at the primaries. Chairman of New Hampshire Republican Party Steven Stepanek. Steven. Hi, Steve. Great Steve. Co-chairman of my New Hampshire campaign Lou Gargiulo. Where’s Lou? Lou Gargiulo. Hi, Lou. How am I doing? Are we winning, Lou? Lou, are we winning? Thank you. You said yes. If he said no, he’s out of here. A friend of mine and a friend of the state, he loves this state and he is a smart cookie. So good. I love him on television. He’s no games. Just looks and gives her the answer, but he’s done a fantastic job. The first person on my whole … You read about all these people. This is the first guy and he’s a great guy and he’s a friend of mine, Corey Lewandowski. Where is Corey? Great guy. Tremendous guy. Tremendous help. Thank you, Corey. Are you having a good time, Corey? Who’s going to win this year, Corey? You bet. A little bit slow with that head, Corey. With the help of everyone here today, we’ve accomplished more in the first three years. We’ve done so much. We’ve done so much. You can go over at taxes and you can go over what we’ve done with the military. We passed the biggest tax cuts ever, ever the history of our country. Now, they want to raise taxes. Think of it. All my life, I’ve watched politicians. Don’t forget, I’ve only been doing this for four and a half years. I haven’t been to … I’ve had senators come in. I’ve had congressmen come in. “Sir, I’ve been doing this for 25 years and in 25 years I’ve only lost three races, sir.” I said, “But I’ve only been doing it for four years and I only won one race, but now I have to win two. One race I won, but it was the president. It was for president.” It was for president, but we did the largest tax cut in the history of our country. We eliminated the most job destroying regulations in the history of our country. I ended the job killing Paris climate accord. That was a killer. That was meant to hurt the United States. By the way, in case you had any questions. Today, the United States is the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere on earth. To give critically ill patients access to lifesaving cures we passed and hopefully anybody here doesn’t need it. Nobody here. Uh-oh, do you need it? Uh-oh. Don’t raise that … Oh she is? Is she okay? I’ll get it for her. Is she okay? We got to get her on the list. Tell me. Oh, from before. Well, that’s a long time before I was president. Does she want to get on the list? Because I’ve seen you at rallies before. I want to get … Will you please, I want to get his wife on the list. It’s called right to try. Right to try. Good work. He’s been a friend of mine. Come on. He’s been here for a long time. He’s been a good guy for a long time. We got to … Is your wife, how she doing? She couldn’t get it before me. Well, we had that with Mueller. You saw that with the Mueller’s last night. You saw that, right? Was that Assad with their incredible daughter, what happened? He said if Trump was president that wouldn’t have happened and they’re right, that would not have happened. We took out al-Baghdadi. I wish I were president, you would had a different solution. Thank you. Thank you. Go ahead. How about you? Yeah. We’ll talk to you later. Right to try. You have no idea. So many people, they used to travel all over the world to get a cure. Now, we can sign a quick simple document. It sounds easy, it wasn’t, but it was easy for me. I understood it. Now, you signed a document. We give you the greatest medicines even if they haven’t been approved. If somebody’s terminally ill, like in the case of your wife, if somebody’s terminally ill, at least you have hope, but it’s beyond that because people have gone home. You have to see some of the results have been incredible. You saw one of the people the other day, right? That wonderful young lady that was so incredible and spoke so well. She’s a special person. She really is a special person. Thank you. We’ll talk to you. Thank you very much. To bring opportunities to our inner cities, I signed the groundbreaking criminal justice reform, prison reform, opportunity zones, permanent funding for historically black colleges and universities. True. Before the China virus came in, before that China virus came in, we had the best job numbers ever recorded the history of our country. We had almost 160 million Americans working. We had never had numbers like that. The Republican party is the party of Abraham Lincoln. Remember that. We stand for so much, including Martin Luther King’s dream of a nation where our children are judged not by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character. You know that. The radical left’s effort to divide everyone by race tears us apart. There’s so much racial hatred, and it’s put there by CNN, by MSDNC… They stoke the flames and they know it. The good news is the ratings aren’t great. So that’s okay. They don’t have great ratings. But they stoke the flames. Uh-oh, CNN just turned off their camera again. They always turn off their camera. Why do I keep doing that? Every time I do it, they turn off their camera. They did it last time. I mention CNN, they’re screaming, turn the camera off. Our movement is about a brighter future for all Americans of every race, religion, color, and creed. Joe Biden spent the last 47 years betraying the African American community. I’ve spent the last four years delivering for the African American community like nobody, with the exception possibly of Abraham Lincoln, has delivered before. It’s true. My first week in office, I withdrew the United States from the last administration’s horrible, stupid, insane Trans Pacific Partnership. Would’ve destroyed the US auto industry and many other industries. New Hampshire lost one in four, and I think much more than that, manufacturing jobs following twin disasters of NAFTA and China’s entrance into the WTO. It was more than one in four. That statistic is wrong. Please have it changed. The statistic is wrong, far more than one in four. Earlier this year, I kept my promise and replaced the NAFTA nightmare with a brand new US-Mexico-Canada Agreement. They said that couldn’t be done. I also took the toughest ever action to stand up to China’s pillaging and plundering of American jobs. Joe Biden’s agenda is made in China. My agenda is made in America. After years of building up other nations, we are finally building up our nation and our jobs, and we’re taking care of our people. Last night, I got great reviews of the speech and all, but some of the fakers back there, they said, “Well, it was a little long. He shouldn’t have used the White House.” Oh really? Tell me. But they said it was a little… Then one person, I think it was Chris Wallace. Nice guy. He’s actually a nice guy. He said that, “He didn’t have the same energy in the speech that he usually has.” Well, it’s a different kind of a speech. Tonight, I’m in New Hampshire and we can wing it. See, actually, actually Chris, who has always wanted to be his father, but it never worked out because of a lack of talent. Actually though, actually Chris has it wrong. If I did last night’s speech here, by now you would have all been walking out. And if I did tonight’s speech there, I would have been criticized by being slightly radical. But we’re having a good time doing it this way, right? Because we are finally putting America first. Under my administration, America’s borders are more secure than ever before. We ended the catch and release, stopped asylum fraud. And we have deported 20,000 gang members and 500,000 criminal aliens. We’ve already built 300 miles of border wall and we’re adding 10 new miles every single week. The wall will soon be completed. And our numbers on the border are the best they’ve ever been. And by the way, Mexico is paying for the wall. Just in case you didn’t know that. They don’t know that. They’re paying for the wall. You haven’t noticed on the wall. Everything was wall, wall. They didn’t think I was going to get it done. Because look, you have one major party controlling Congress and they don’t want to give me a wall. So they’re going crazy. “Wall. The wall’s not getting done.” Then I get it done. Get it from the military, get it from everything. I’m a developer. I know how to get money. It’s one of those. Developers understand. And now that the wall is almost complete, it’ll be soon complete. And it’s the wall that border security wanted so badly. This is the one. But now that it’s built, you never hear about the wall. They don’t talk about it anymore. They don’t talk about it anymore. It’s incredible. But the wall will soon be complete. We’ve invested $2.5 trillion in the US military and launched the first new branch of the US Armed Forces in nearly 75 years. The space force. And Al, in honor of you, we have passed VA Choice and VA Accountability, Al. That guy’s been bugging me for years. Al has been bugging me. What’s in that hat, Al? Let me see. Let me… It’s something. Al, he’s been bugging me for years. Did you ever think we’d get VA Choice, VA Accountability? Did you ever really believe it? Thank you, Al. I withdrew from the last administration’s disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal, a disaster. $150 billion we paid Iran for a basically short term deal. And we gave them… What’s more impressive, we also gave them $1.8 billion in cash. Cash. Many plane loads. You know what that took? Many, many plane loads, $1.8 billion. I said bad. That’s when I realized how powerful a president is in the United States. When a president has the right, which by the way, I don’t believe he did have that right, okay? When a president has the right to go into the banks and take out $1.8 billion and hand it to people that hate our guts, that’s power. That’s power. I don’t believe he had the right to do it. I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the US embassy in Jerusalem. I recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights and we achieved the first breakthrough in the Middle East in 25 years. You saw that just last week. UAE, highly respected. Mohamed, highly respected. UAE and Israel. And now they’re all going to be coming in. Now they’re all saying, “How come you didn’t tell us about this?” You’ll have peace in the Middle East. And yet we’re moving our trips out. It’s pretty amazing, actually. We’ll get no credit for it, but that’s all right. Remember that Kaitlan. Cover that properly, Kaitlan. We like Kaitlan. Together, we’ve spent the last four years cleaning up 47 years of Biden disasters. Joe Biden has spent his entire career on the wrong side of history. He supported NAFTA. China’s entry. He’s done so many things. This man, if you look at what he’s done, we went into a deal, the Korea, you know about the Korea deal? Hillary Clinton’s deal, along with Biden. They promised 250,000 jobs, right? 250,000 jobs. And they were right. Except all those jobs went to South Korea. They didn’t come to us. He wants mass amnesty. He wants illegal aliens to be taken care of, healthcare and every other way. And he wants to raise your taxes, [inaudible 00:09:52]. Look, your taxes are going to go through the roof. He’s going to destroy your health care. He’s going to have socialized medicine. Remember what Obama said 28 times? You can keep your doctor. You can keep your plan. Turned out to be a lie. Now you’re going to lose your doctor again. And we’re going to lose 185 million people who have private health insurance. Who has private health insurance here? And you love it, right? You love it. It’s luxury. It’s good. It’s beautiful. And you have the greatest, you’re going to lose it. Hate to tell you. Under his plan, you’re going to lose your private healthcare. So here’s a guy, I go into Texas two weeks ago. We had, by the way, on the highway and the roadways, thousands and thousands of people like lined up on the runway in New Hampshire, by the way. What happened to those people? But we had thousands and thousands of people. So I’m in Texas. I’m also, last week in Florida, we got total endorsement from all of the sheriffs. All over Florida. Ohio, many places. But think of Texas. He’s against oil and gas. He’s against guns. And he’s against religion. So you’re in Texas, you’re in Texas, where I’m winning by a lot. They say Texas is very close. I don’t think so. They said that last time too. Remember they said it last time? For them to call it early, you have to be really. So I heard, for a year, Texas is going to be very close. It’s going to be, everybody believed that except for the people that lived in Texas. So at 8:00, the polls close. And they said, “Donald Trump has won the state of Texas.” Simultaneously with the closing. I’m now running in Texas against a man who’s against oil, guns, and God. How do you win Texas? I said this, you could bring George Washington back as your Presidential candidate. You could bring Abraham Lincoln. Let’s put him as the Vice Presidential candidate. Run in Texas and other states, you couldn’t win. You couldn’t win. Now, they’re not going to win. We’re going to win this. And you’re against the oil stuff too. Because his whole thing on oil, no fracking, no this, no that. New England has the highest energy costs in the United States. And you know why? Because Governor Cuomo will not let a pipeline go across the tip of New York State so that oil and gas, of which we have plenty, can come. And do you know where you buy your energy from? Russia. Did you know that? You have ships, much of it from Russia, because Governor Cuomo, New York won’t allow a pipeline and they’re desperate to have something happen in upper New York State. And those are great people, but they’ve been treated very badly. But they won’t allow a pipeline. By not allowing a pipeline, we’re trying to do it through essentially eminent domain. By not allowing a pipeline to go through upper New York State and create a lot of jobs for them, you have the highest energy prices in the United States by far. Thank you New York. Thank you. Thank you Governor Cuomo. Biden voted for the Iraq war. I was against the Iraq war. He opposed a mission to take out Osama bin Laden. He opposed the killing of Soleimani. You remember that one? He oversaw the rise of ISIS and he cheered the rise of China as a positive development for America and for the world. That’s not a positive development. Before they went into the WTO, China was flat lined. For years and years and decades, flat lined. And then they got into the WTO and a lot of bad things happened. First China’s stole our jobs, plundered our intellectual property and unleashed the virus. And now China is trying to just hug and kiss Joe Biden. They want him so badly. Look, if you like China, you should vote for Biden, that I can tell you. How about his son? You think the son, maybe there’s a conflict? How about his son? Where’s Hunter? Where is Hunter? Where is Hunter? Does anybody know? Where’s Hunter? He’s in another country right now, probably, ripping off another country. No, as soon as Biden became vice president, bad things happened with respect to a Hunter. If that happened with respect to my family, I wouldn’t be standing. I guarantee you that. I guarantee you that. What a disgrace. What a disgrace. Ukraine. And it’s not just Ukraine and it’s not just China. But he goes into China, takes out $1.5 billion to manage, and he knows nothing, and he wasn’t even employed. He got thrown out of the armed services. So give me a break. It’s a disgrace, what’s happening. There’s a double… There’s a thing happening with the media like nobody’s ever seen before. These people right here. Because if that happened to a Republican, in particular. If any of that stuff happened to me, it would be brutal. But it happened to him. They don’t want to talk about it. And how about the questions asked by Anderson Cooper yesterday? Anderson Cooper. He’s interviewed me a lot over the years and I always got along with him, but they were tough interviews. Did you hear the questions? And Biden kept looking down. I think he was reading the answers off a teleprompter. Right? I think he was reading the answers off a teleprompter. And that’s happened before. And how about David Muir of ABC? He’s a nice guy, right? How soft were those questions? How soft were those? They don’t ask me questions like that. They got fire pouring out of their eyes. No. “Mr. Vice President, what do you think of this? How was your breakfast, sir? Did you enjoy it?” When I banned travel from China Biden, called it hysterical and xenophobic. He even used, somewhere along the line, the word racist. He always figures, they always want to get that word in there. If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands of more Americans would have died. But instead my decision, saved thousands and thousands of lives. And then we banned Europe very early because I saw what was going on, really in Italy and Spain and France. When the virus arrived, we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II. Mike Pence did a great job. We produced more than 100,000 ventilators within weeks. And not a single American who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator, not one. You heard all about, and now we’re producing ventilators. Hard to produce. Expensive, complex. We’re producing them now for the rest of the world. 188 countries were affected by this. We pioneered advances in treatment that have reduced the monthly rate. And you look at this, the mortality rate has been reduced by 85% since April. Think of that. 85% since April. Under Operation Warp Speed, three different vaccines are right now in final stage trials. If you go back three years, that would have been something that would have been impossible to even discuss. It would have taken years. We will produce a vaccine this year and together we will defeat the virus. It’s already getting defeated. And by the way, another big Democrat hoax. Another big hoax. I want football back. I’m the one that’s been saying. Is that a correct statement? I want football back. These are young, strong guys. They’re not going to be affected by the virus. If you look at it, it’s generally older people. Older people that have heart conditions, that have diabetes, that have problems. These are big strong guys. They’ll be just fine. But I want football back. I’ve been calling for football to be back, including Big 10. Big 10, get with it. Open up your season, Big 10. And the Dems don’t want it back for political reasons. But now their new line… This is like Russia, Russia, Russia. All this crap they come up with. Now their new line is they are trying to blame me and keep football shut down. They want to keep it shut down. And they’re saying that President Trump shut it down. I’m the one that wants it open. So they’re reversing it. They’re playing a big con game. It’s just a con game. And that’s what we’re dealing with. And we have to defeat them on November 3rd. I want football back and Big 10 open. And now the other day, Joe Biden came up with a plan to impose a blanket shutdown. He’d be willing to do another blanket. And we had to do it. We blanket, we shut down. We saved millions of lives. Instead of the number we have today, 175,000, we could have had 2 million today instead. It would have been unacceptable, unsustainable. Unsustainable. We did everything right. We did it right. We closed it down. We stopped China. We stopped Europe. Now we’re opening it up and we’re opening it up to record numbers, despite the fact that the Democrats are keeping their states shut down and hurting people that live in those states, shut down as long as possible. But now Biden wants to do another blanket shutdown, possibly, that would decimate the economy and cause suicides, drug overdoses, alcohol abuse, heart attacks, joblessness. You’d have jobs, all of the problems that it causes. Because it’s not just a one sided equation. A shut down causes big problems also. And at this point, when the economy is roaring back. We had record job numbers this last quarter, over 9 million jobs. We’re going to throw that all out? We have a market… You know, your stock market. Who has 401k’s here? Your 401k’s and your stocks, when you have stocks, would be obliterated. And right now, we have just, on two of your markets, as you know, S&P and NASDAQ, you’re at new records. And you’re about to hit another new record. Think of it. Who would have thought the stock market? And hopefully we’re at the end of this horrible China virus. Came from China. They should have stopped it and they did. But who would have thought, just who would have thought that the stock market is at record levels right now? Record levels. And everything else is going to follow. Before the virus, we created an economic miracle and now we’re doing it again. We did the Paycheck Protection Program where we saved more than 200,000 jobs in New Hampshire alone. 200,000, right? Over the past three months, we’ve gained so many different, if you look at retail numbers. Take a look at our retail numbers. They’re literally at records. Look at some of the numbers be announced by companies. They’re at records. Can you imagine giving that all up and starting again? It’s not acceptable. If I’m reelected, we will create 10 million jobs over the next 10 months, and we’ll do that easily. The Biden agenda, with big tax increases and big regulation increases, would immediately kill everything. You will go into a depression. And I’m very good at predicting this. You will go into a depression the likes of which this country has not seen since 1929, and who knows, maybe worse than that. They are playing a suicide mission if they want to raise your taxes. They want to raise your taxes by $4 trillion. And that’s going to be almost everybody. They’re saying for the rich. No, not for the rich. They’re going to be raising everybody’s taxes almost. Joe Biden is running on the most extreme far left platform of any nominee in American history and of our foreign adversaries, we’re devising a plan to destroy the United States from within. All they have to look is at the Biden Harris. How about her? Is she a beauty? What a beauty that is. They pick a woman who starts off… She starts off sort of strong. She’s one of the favorites. Within a period of a few months, she goes down, down 15, 12, 11, nine, eight, five, three, two. Then she goes, “I’m going to leave because I’ve decided that I want to leave. I want to leave.” She left because she wouldn’t have gotten any votes. She was terrible. This would be your president possibly. I don’t think so. I don’t think so. I want to see the first woman president also, but I don’t want to see a woman president get into that position the way she do it and she’s not competent. She’s not competent. They’re all saying we want Ivanka. I don’t blame them. They want to eliminate America’s borders in the middle of a pandemic, suspend all deportations, restore catch and release, and expand horrible, dangerous, disgusting sanctuary cities. They want to give illegal aliens government healthcare and taxpayer funded lawyers. That’s what we need is more lawyers. Let’s get some more lawyers into the act. They want to end national security travel bands from jihadist nations, very dangerous, and increase refugee admissions by 700%. This is in the Bernie Sanders, crazy Bernie, you know crazy Bernie. A lot of his people are going to vote for me just like they did last time. You know why? Because of trade. Because I agree with Bernie Sanders, but my trade policies are much tougher than his and I’m able to do it. All you have to do is how is China doing last year with my trade policy? Not too well. And we had the best year we’ve ever had. We’re going to get a lot of Bernie Sanders voters because they like my attitude on trade. They really like it because I’ve been telling people for years our country is being ripped off by China and many other countries, including, I hate to say it, our allies. Our allies have been ripping us big. And you heard me say last night, NATO, I got $130 billion from them first time going up to $400 billion a year from NATO countries, by saying, “You got to do it. You got to do it.” And general Secretary Stoltenberg said it can’t be done. He could not believe it. He’s actually my biggest fan and nobody ever calls him for a quote. Call him sometime. They want to abolish cash bail and cut funding for law enforcement. They want to end… We want to increase law enforcement, not cut law enforcement. And by the way, Pat Lynch is a great guy, New York, New York. Really great, New York’s finest, right? Their rights have been taken away from them. Literally they’re not allowed to do their job, but Pay Lynch, he said the first time in history that they know of New York’s finest have endorsed a candidate. The candidate is Donald Trump. First time they’ve done it. All over the country, the sheriffs of Florida, all of Texas, all over the country, Ohio, law enforcement’s endorsing Trump. I cannot imagine them getting any law enforcement endorsements. If they do, please let me know and we’ll have a little discussion. We’ll ask why did that happen? They want to end school choice and ban charter schools. They want to abolish American energy, including all of the things I said before. And add to that coal and add to that shale. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, a bright future, the American dream for all Americans. There is no limit to what we can achieve with four more years. So in conclusion, I have to say this. Over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing super power of the world that’s happening already. We will end our reliance on China once and for all. We’ll do it here. Like we used to do in the good old days before we owed trillions of dollars. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, surge federal prosecutors into high crime communities and neighborhoods and ban sanctuary cities. We will kill our terrorist’s enemies as we’ve been doing while keeping America out of the endless foreign Wars. I go to Dover and I greet these incredible families of soldiers that have been so sadly killed. So sadly killed. It’s such a shame. I go to the hospital, I go to Walter Reed Medical Center. It’s incredible. The doctors are so talented. I see what they can do, but soldiers so badly hurt. And they’re really acting as police. They’re acting as police. Now, we’re very low in Afghanistan now in terms of numbers of troops. We’re getting out. We’ll be getting out soon. We’re very low in Iraq. We’re very low in Syria, except we kept the oil. We left some behind for the oil. If you don’t mind, we kept the oil. We should have kept the oil in Iraq like I’ve been saying. We’ll appoint prosecutors, judges, and justices who believe in enforcing the law, not their own political agenda, which is what we have in many cases right now. The next president will be in my opinion, responsible for two, three, four, and maybe, maybe even five US Supreme Court Justices. You better vote for me, you better vote for me or you’re going to have the greatest depression you’ve ever seen. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms. Second amendment. We will surprise medical billing require, it’s already done. I signed it. Nobody can believe I did it. Price transparency. You know what that is? Do you know how big that is? Where you’re able to actually negotiate with hospitals, see their prices, compare it. You know who likes it? Good hospitals and good doctors. Other people don’t like it. It’s the biggest thing and nobody even talks about it, but I’ve already put it into effect. The bad news is it goes into effect on January 1st. You better make sure you elect me so I get credit for it. Otherwise, could you imagine if sleepy Joe got in and medical prices and drug prices and everything had dropped, but he said, “I wonder what happened?” And I did it all. I’ll be so angry at New Hampshire. I’ll never speak to you again. Now, all these things, what we’re doing with drugs, we instituted a favored nations laws. We instituted favored nations. That’s going to drop your prices 50, 60, 70%. And I’m the only president in 51 years, last year, drug prices went down a little, not much, but they went down the first time in 51 years. Favored nations could drop at 50, 60, or 70%. On top of that, I instituted rebates where the rebates go toward price reductions and back to the customer instead of to a middleman. So we will protect Medicare and we will protect Social Security and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to plant its beautiful American flag. Do we love our American flag? Or Mars. Above all, we will teach our children to love our country, to honor our history and be inspired by the words of the New Hampshire state motto. Have you ever heard of these words? Live free or die. Live free or die. Vote for those people. And you do, you have a great governor. Vote for your people, vote for your governor. You have a great governor. From Portsmouth to Dixville from Concord to Keene. I know a friend from Keene. Great guy. I had a friend from Keene a long time. Keene, New Hampshire. And Merrimack to Manchester, we will fight for every job, every family and every neighborhood. We will fight for every vote. We have to win. We have no choice. Can I be honest with you? We’re working hard. We’re all working. I don’t have to do this. I could get off that beautiful plane that used to be black and white with a red stripe. That was mine. But that’s Air Force one. I get off that beautiful plane. I could come up and say, “Ladies and gentlemen of New Hampshire, you have no choice. You have to vote for me because if you don’t, you’ll be put in radical lefties. You’ll have a depression. Your stocks will be worthless. Your 401ks will be gone. There’ll be crime all over your streets. So I’m not going to work at all. I’m leaving now, but you have to vote for me because you have no choice.” Right? I could say it. Right? Right? We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blazed the trail, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, laid down the railroads. Won two World Wars, defeated fascism and communism and made America the greatest nation in the history of the world and we are making it greater. We will be greater than ever before. Incredible citizens like you, the people of New Hampshire, helped build this country. And together we are taking back our country. We are not going to let the radical left socialists or communists take our country. We’re not going to let it. We’re returning power to you the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one nation under God. And we don’t take the beautiful word God out of our Pledge of Allegiance, do we? They did it twice. They it twice. Then they say, “Well, we didn’t mean that.” Oh, I see. I was listening once they said, “That’s right.” You don’t know what it is, what happened? What happened? They did it on purpose. They did it twice. That’s where they’re coming from. You can be fools and you can be fooled, but that’s where they’re coming from. So don’t be surprised, but they’re not going to get there. We’re not going to let it happen. We’re not going to let our country be destroyed by a bunch of nut jobs. America will soon be thriving like never before and together with the people of New Hampshire that have meant so much to me, and I brought down opioid and I brought down drug problems for you by 19% and nobody even talks about it. 19. I talk about New Hampshire a lot because you had one of the proportionally worst problems of any country, of any state in this incredible country. You had one of the worst problems of any of the states. And I talk about you a lot. It was incredible. And you still have. But we brought it down 19% and people are absolutely shocked. If it weren’t for the China plague, the number would be 25 or 30%. That really hurt us because people sort of went back to some old ways because they don’t want to be shut down any longer. Joe, don’t you understand that? They don’t want to be shut down. So I worked very hard on that for this state and for other states, but this was a state that was so severely impacted with the drug problem. That wall is stopping them and it’s stopping them like never before. It’s stopping them like never before. I want to thank New Hampshire for all you’ve done for me. I want to thank New Hampshire. You were my first victory, as I said, but you are going to lead a nation to the most important victory and the most important election that we’ve ever had. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you.
















"
"46","08-29-20","John, thank you very much, and I know you’re going to be talking to us about some additional help, and actually I look forward to that meeting. Normally, I wouldn’t, but the people can use it down here. I see… Incredible. What’s the percentage of people that have insurance on their homes? Not for long, I can see. So we'll be talking about that, I think? We’ll be talking about it. Well, thank you very much, everybody. And I’m here to support the great people of Louisiana. It’s been a tremendous state for me. I love the people. We’ve had a good relationship right from the beginning. It’s very important that I was here, and already met some people that have been absolutely devastated. This was a tremendously powerful storm. In fact, when it came in, it was actually much bigger than Katrina, I would say. Katrina being somewhat of a landmark, I think, in terms of devastation, but this had more power. This was almost coming in at a five. It was a five a little bit out offshore, and it came in as a four, but 150 mile an hour. It was up to 185 at one point. I don’t know that we’ve ever seen that. But we’re joined by Governor John Bel Edwards and Senator John Kennedy, two friends of mine. They’ve done a fantastic job representing the state. And acting Secretary of Homeland Security, who’s no longer really acting in my mind, because he just got a promotion. And if John Kennedy can push him with Bill, that’d be terrific because he deserves it. He’s been doing a great job. There’s the man. Don’t talk to me anymore. I’ve done it for you. Right there is the man. But thank you very much, Chad. And FEMA administrator, Pete Gaynor. Pete, great job. And he’s all over the country right now doing different things. And we have a lot of different elements happening, but we have to take care of Louisiana. We have to take care of Texas. Texas got a little bit lucky. Thanks also to the members of Congress that are here. I have a little list. That’s a lot of members. I don’t know. Where are you folks back there? I love those guys. First of all, Louisiana Attorney General. Where’s Jeff? Jeff Landry. Jeff, could you hear Jeff? He is so good. He is so tough and so good. And I agree with so much of what you do, almost all of it. I’m not sure that I’ve seen anything I don’t agree with. Great job, Jeff Landry, everybody. Thank you very much. Congressman Steve Scalise. Steve, he’s probably the bravest man in the room, but he’s done good. And I actually think he’s better looking today than he was three years ago, if you want to know the truth. He went through hell, and we found out that his family loves him. That’s for sure, because were they were with you all the way. That was a rough time in that hospital that night, right? That was a rough time, Steve. We’re glad to have you. People love you. People love you. Congressman Clay Higgins, and Clay, thank you very much, Clay, for being here. Congressman Garret Graves. Garret, nice to see you. What are you doing sitting back there? I can’t believe it. That’s not like you and Mike. I can’t believe you guys. They’re being low key today for a change. Right? And Mike Johnson, my friend, and he’s been a supporter. They’re all warriors. These people are warriors. They fight for us and they fight for the people that they represent, and they’re incredible warriors. Thank you, Mike. I appreciate it very much. And State Senator Mark Abraham, and Mark, thank you. Good job you’re doing here. Great job. James Waskom, Director of Louisiana Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness. Good. You’ve got plenty to prepare for. Now do you have other storms, James, coming in? Is that what I’m hearing? You got to be kidding, James. Don't let that happen. In other words, they’re heading in a general direction. Is that what you’re saying? That’s not good. What looks like the likelihood that they actually form and reach? So you had some tremendously bad storms 50, 60, 70 years ago. You and I were talking about dates. What’s the difference now, would you say, in terms of storms coming in now compared to many years ago? Quickly. That's right. So that really, the fact that they finally did get out, they saw it build. It built so fast, didn’t it? Because it looked like it was going to be the lesser between Marco and this, and Marco-It disintegrated, and this just came in roaring. It’s unbelievable. Nick Hunter. Nick, thank you. Great job, Nick. Great job you’re doing. We appreciate it. Mayor of Lake Charles, you got hit hard. Were you the hardest hit, would you say, Nick? Yeah, you took a punch. A hundred percent? So when people get used to air conditioning, and this is very hot, when people get used to air conditioning and all of a sudden they don’t have it, that’s a very traumatic situation, isn’t it? Yeah. Well, you have a great reputation. Thank you. Thank you very much. Michael Danahay. Michael? Hi, Michael. Hi, Michael. How are you doing, Michael? As mayor of Sulfur, are you hit, would you say, like this one? Pretty much like this one? Very close. How’s it going? Well, good job. Good luck. And the mayor of Westlake, Bob Hardey. Thank you, Bob. How's it going? Similar. Well, you’ll all get it going. One thing I know about this state, they rebuild it fast. There’s no problem. And we’ll supply what we have to supply, and you know what a lot of that is? A thing called green. Right? And we’ll take care of you. I’ll be speaking with you and John. And I just want to recognize Bill Cassidy and Congressman Ralph Abraham, two great people. And Bill’s going through a problem. And I hope Ralph is fine, right? Ralph is fine. And Bill is going through a problem, but I spoke to him the other day and it sounds like he’s doing well. And he’s been, along with John, a terrific senator. So Hurricane Laura was a category four storm and it was actually for a little while, a five. And it was actually for a little while a five. It was up to 175, almost 180 miles an hour. Few people have ever even heard of that with winds. Currently when it came in, it was at 150 miles per hour at landfall, damaging thousands of homes and causing hundreds of road blockages and major power outages. And I heard, I think this is correct, that it was the most powerful storm coming in and hitting your land in 150 years. Coming in. Yeah, you don't know. How do they do it? They put their finger up, right? I just visited the Cajun Navy and the relief center. They’re fantastic. I want to thank the pastors, and we had a great pastor just gave us a little prayer. And he didn’t choke. He gave a great prayer, I’ll tell you. He got up there and he just gave it. I’ve seen some didn’t quite get it out as nicely, but he did a fantastic job. And I want to thank all of the pastors across the state, people of faith across the state who have been helping families and communities recover. Before the storm struck, I approved an emergency declaration under the auspices of John and John Bel. We had a very quick one. I would say you got that almost immediately, wouldn’t you say, John? I think before the storm got here, you had your emergency. We knew what was coming. Yeah. Thank you, John. But we got it very quickly, and we’re going to be discussing some other things in a little while. Yesterday, I approved a major disaster declaration that helps individuals and business owners, which is a little bit different, but it goes right to the individual. And I’ve signed that already. And so you’re all set to go on that. FEMA has delivered 2.6 million liters of water and 1.4 million meals. And that’s a lot of meals. So you’re pretty busy, I guess, Pete, right? That’s incredible. Great job. Your people are incredible. I haven’t had, and Pete’s done this now for a long time, but I haven’t had one complaint with all of the storms we’ve had in Texas and here and every… I haven’t had one complaint. So you’ve done a hell of a job, Pete. Thank you. Pete Gaynor, everybody. Don’t hire him away, please. Private enterprises look and they say, “Hey, let’s go take him away.” Don’t let him leave, John, please. All right? Is that all right? We’re also assisting state and local officials to restore water to roughly 180,000 residents and to protect energy infrastructure. I want to thank the men and women of FEMA and the first responders and the law enforcement, which we love and we cherish, and doing a fantastic job and don’t get the kind of recognition that they should get. But actually they do because the people love them, right? The people love them. And we appreciate our law enforcement. Our hearts go out to the families who have lost loved ones. What is the number would you say, John, right now? Amazing. Well, it’s a tremendous number, but you were thinking it could’ve been a lot worse. Yeah. Amazing. Amazing. So 15 years ago this week, Louisiana was devastated by Hurricane Katrina. Katrina seems to be the standard. It seems to be the one that’s… 15, is it actually today? 15 years ago today. And whether you come from Louisiana or Fifth Avenue in New York City, you know all about Katrina, right? That was a bad, bad deal. And devastation, and now the devastation was far greater, even though the storm probably wasn’t as powerful. Correct. Are your levies now in good shape? The best ever. Good. That’s good. So you came together and you rebuilt. America helped. And here we are today, and you’re going to have this situation taken care of very, very quickly. I’d like to ask Governor John Bell Edwards to say a few words. And then, John, if you would say a few words, and we’ll take a few questions from the press if you’d like. We’ll talk about primarily this storm. Okay? Are you in need of water too? Bottles of water? When you think of it, Louisiana has been through a lot with the COVID and with this couple of other things, and you have all done a very good job. Is that right? You’ve done a great job. You’ve done a great job. Thank you very much. And Nick, I’m going to come back and find out at the end of three weeks how popular you are. This is a big test. But you’re going to be very good. You may be very much better if you could be better, which I doubt. John, please say a few words. John can you? We did good. Yeah. Or they would've been in a basement. You know, if anybody would like to make a statement, Steve, would you like to make a statement? And we do, Steve. And we do have their back. Mike Johnson. Would you want to say something? Alright. I always will. Fellas? Anybody? Let's go, go ahead. So when you’re a young guy [crosstalk 00:20:57] I didn’t know you were so young. He’s a young guy. Yes, please. That was the bad one. That was the water more than one. That was a bad one. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Great job you’re doing. Give the information once again, please. Gary? Gary, anything to say? That’s great. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Pete, let me ask you, you’re bringing the big generators down. Are they here yet? Are you bringing, thank you very much. Any questions of any of the folks. And any questions of any of the folks? Could you possibly take that off because I can't hear you? Well, they’re doing a very good job down here with respect to that and even pre-storm. But I’ll ask John Bel to say a few words about that. John? Chad, do you want to answer that question? Go ahead just take if off. Got a little bit lucky. That’s what I’ve heard from some people. Thank you all very much. We’ll be making another stop soon. Thank you very much.

"47","08-31-20","Just closed out another month of stock market. We had the best stock market Dow in 36 years. That’s very impressive. So people are very happy with their 401Ks and with the stocks that they have, and that’s a tremendous achievement. Best in 36 years. Let me begin with a brief update on the China virus. Over the last month, our new cases in the United States have declined by 38%. Last week, we announced a breakthrough in testing that will allow us to have over 150 million rapid point of care tests. These tests return the results in less than 15 minutes, and many will be deployed to nursing homes. We’re focusing very strongly on nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and other locations that serve high risk populations. So we’re going to have the 15 minutes and less tests, and we will have 150 million rapid point of care tests. That’s something. This evening I’m pleased to announce that AstraZeneca vaccine has reached phase three clinical trials, so that’s joining another group of vaccines that are very close to the end and hopefully approval. In the United States we’re doing things that nobody thought would have been even possible. This is a process that would have taken, in some cases, years, and we did it in a matter of months. Thanks to the efforts of Operation Warp Speed, we remain on track to deliver a vaccine very rapidly, in record time. I also want to provide an update on left-wing political violence that we’re seeing in Democrat-run cities. Under my administration, federal law enforcement is working with state and local authorities all over the country to comb through hours of video, track down rioters, looters, and arsonists and bring them to justice. We’ve just come up with a report that we’ve arrested a large number of people. It’s over 200. You’ll be hearing about that, but they’ve been arrested in various cities throughout the United States. We’re doing it very low key, but we’re trying to help cities. They are in all cases Democrat-run, but we’re doing the best we can to help them without really much of a consent. We’d like to have the consent, as an example, in Portland. We could solve that problem in approximately one hour, but the mayor refuses, perhaps for political reasons. I don’t know why it’s good for him to have a city that’s falling apart and that’s under siege now for 94 days. But really it’s been under siege for years, if you know Portland. So to the mayor I say whenever you’re ready, let us know. We’ll solve your problem of violence. We’ll solve your problem of crime. We’ll arrest those criminals very rapidly, and you’ll be able to have some nice evenings in Portland. The Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice are announcing a joint operation center to investigate the violent left-wing, civil unrest. And again, in Portland alone, the federal government has already taken care of and arrested 100 rioters just in that one city. The wave of violence and destruction that we’ve seen in recent weeks and months has occurred in cities exclusively controlled and dominated by the Joe Biden party. If you take a look, the top 10 in the country are Democrats. It’s Democrat-run cities, and it’s a shame, and it can be solved very easily. The violence is fueled by dangers, rhetoric from far-left politicians that demonize our nation and demonize our police. We have to allow our police to do what they’re very good at doing. We’ve taken that power away. They’re afraid to lose their pension, their job, their everything. They’re afraid to be destroyed. You saw this when left-wing extremists attacked law-abiding citizens attending the Republican National Convention at the White House, including Senator Rand Paul and his wonderful wife, Kelly, what they went through. But other people went through it, too. And that was done very systematically. That was done on purpose. They knew we were having the convention, and they wanted to do everything they could to disrupt it. And the good news is the public is very wise to it. They see what’s happening and they’re wise to it, and I think they are probably acting accordingly. Left-wing rioters are repeating the same false narrative about America that you hear about the… Really, you hear this from people, what they’re saying, how they’re saying it, the violence, it’s terrible. And again, it’s Democrat politicians. I don’t know that they’re sparing it on, or they’re afraid to stop it. But in any event, we’re there to help. We’re there to get things under control. What they did on Thursday night at the White House, just outside of the White House, to people that came from all over the world is a disgrace. It’s a disgrace. And frankly, the mayor, Democrat mayor, Mayor Bowser should have done a better job. She did a very poor job, but at the same time we had the police who were very brave. They helped Rand. I guess it started off with two, and they took a beating, if you can believe this. They really took some heavy hits. One went down, but got right up, and two others joined them and they were able to get Rand and Kelly through. But it was a terrible, terrible thing to witness. But other people went through similar, not to the extent in terms of taping. We don’t have the tapes as strong, but some people went through, from what I heard, as bad or worse. The violent rioters share Biden’s same talking points, and they share his same agenda for our nation. And even his strange speech today that he made in Pittsburgh, it didn’t mention the fact… He didn’t mention the far-left. He didn’t mention the far-left or, from what I saw, I don’t believe he mentioned the word Antifa. Antifa is a criminal organization, and he didn’t mention Antifa thugs, but mostly seemed to blame the police and law enforcement. He went on point after point after point. He even talked about those on the right, but he didn’t talk about those on the left, and those on the left are. The problem and Antifa is the problem. The rioters and Joe Biden have a side. They’re both on the side of the radical left, and that is so obvious. And until that neutralizes, you’re never going to have safe areas in those Democrat-run areas. For months, Joe Biden has given moral aid and comfort to the vandals, repeating the monster’s lie that these were peaceful protests. They’re not peaceful protests. That’s anarchy. You look at the agitators. You look at the looters. You look at the rioters. That’s not a peaceful protest. They keep using the term. It’s so nice, peaceful protest, and behind the reporter the cities are burning. We could solve it very quickly if they ask us to come in, like we did in Minneapolis and like we just did in Wisconsin, where I’ll be going tomorrow. And at least the governor asked me if I could, we would. I said, “You got to get the National Guard.” And he finally agreed to even a small number, but they were able to take care of things. And that was about five days ago, six days ago, and ever since, it’s been very good. 13 members of Biden’s campaign staff donated to bail and rioters, getting them out of jail. Looters, they got them out of jail. And his running mate, Kamala, urged their supporters to do the same thing. It’s outrageous that they’re now seeking to shift the blame for the mayhem, and they really want to put it on the backs of the police. I see it. There’s just a war on law enforcement in this country, and without law enforcement, we wouldn’t have a country. We have very talented people. They’re not allowed to do their job. If you give the radical left power, what you’re seeing in the Democrat-run cities will be brought to every city in this country. If they have that power, every city in this country could be potentially another Portland or another Chicago, where they’ve had such problems to defeat them. We must jail lawbreakers, and we must defeat their hateful ideology about this country, about America. We must teach our children that America is an exceptional, free, and just nation worth defending, preserving, and protecting, and that’s what we want to do. They want to destroy our country. They’re going to destroy our suburbs, but I think I’ve gone a long way from allowing that to happen. The suburbs are protected, especially with the rule changes that I made. I took them out of the Obama administration. They were going to be made much worse. What we’re witnessing today as a result of left-wing indoctrination in our nation’s schools and universities, many young Americans have been fed lies about America being a wicked nation, plagued by racism. Indeed, Joe Biden and his party spent their entire convention spreading this hateful and destructive message while refusing to say one word about the violence. They didn’t even discuss law enforcement, the police. Those words weren’t mentioned. Two words that were taken out were the words under God, under God. Two very important words in the Pledge of Allegiance, in their caucus. I guess they did it twice. They took it out of their Pledge of Allegiance. I heard it the one time, and I said, “That’s strange. That’s a big…” Tell you, I figured they maybe made a mistake, something happened. No, they didn’t make a mistake. Then they did it later on. So they essentially took the word God out of the Pledge of Allegiance. We’re not taking the word God out of anything. We’re not taking it out of our Pledge of Allegiance, and we’re not taking the great word God out of anything. At our convention, we highlighted law enforcement heroes and repeatedly emphasized that violence has no place in American political discourse. The left’s war on police, faith, history, and American values is tearing our country apart, which is what they want. They think it’s good, but it’s gotten out of control. They’re unable to control this radical left crazy movement, but we can control it very quickly. Very, very quickly indeed. The only path to unity is to rebuild a shared national identity focused on common American values and virtues, of which we have plenty. This includes restoring patriotic education in our nation schools where they’re trying to change everything that we’ve learned. What we’ve learned, in fact, what most of you have learned, they want to change it. They want to change it for whatever reason, cancel culture, whatever you want to call it. At the same time, we must strictly and fully enforce our law and have no tolerance for anarchy and no tolerance, zero, for violence. Anyone who breaks the law should be arrested, prosecuted, and punished. This includes targeting law enforcement efforts to focus on Antifa, the left-wing domestic terror organization. The mission of Antifa is to spread terror in the US population with a goal of getting Americans to give up to their agenda. This is how terrorist organizations have always operated. Biden won’t even say the name Antifa. I don’t believe he said it today. He made a speech and he didn’t mention that. He mentioned others, but he didn’t mention Antifa. He mentioned law enforcement and mentioned the police, but he didn’t mention Antifa. I wonder why. And if he cannot name the problem, there’s no way that he’ll solve the problem. You don’t name it, you don’t solve it. In fact, Biden would give Antifa exactly what it wants, the far-left policy agenda it’s asking for. And if that happened, we don’t have much of a country left. If you give violent extremists what they want, the violence doesn’t go away. They gain new power to spread the terror nationwide. Most of our nation is extremely safe, by the way. You only see the bad. You see Portland and Chicago and you see what’s happened in New York, just in a very short period of time. It’s horrible what’s happened in New York. I love New York. I come from New York, and when I see… Four years ago I left, and I could see that it was problems under this mayor. He’s a terrible mayor, one of the worst. I can’t say the worst. I mean, I’ve witnessed Portland. Hard to top him, but he’s certainly one of the worst. And when I look at what’s happening in New York and I look at what’s happening in the city and so quickly. It happened so quickly. It’s a shame. Biden’s strategy is to surrender to the left-wing mob, which is exactly what he’s doing… I don’t think he even knows what he’s doing… and give them control over every lever of power in the United States government. But when you surrender the mob, you don’t get freedom. You get fascism. That’s what happens in all cases. You take a look at Venezuela. Look what’s gone on there and other places. Biden is using mafia talking points. The mob will leave you alone if you give them what you want. That’s what it is. The mob will leave you alone if give them what you want, but it doesn’t work that way. Because once you give them, they keep taking, taking, taking. What happens is you give and give and give and you take and they no longer respect you. And that’s what’s happened with the Democrats because I actually think they’ve lost control of these radical left, many X. I think they’ve lost control because I don’t think they feel that’s helping them when New York and Chicago and Portland, and you look at Oakland and you look at Baltimore and you look at so many different places and what’s going on there, the top 10 are all run by Democrats. And you can go a lot further down the list than 10. In America, we will never surrender to mob rule because if the mob rules, democracy is indeed dead. The reason we’re continuing to see violence in left-wing cities today is that liberal politicians, mayors, prosecutors, and judges are refusing to enforce the law and put the rioters in jail. These are rioters. These are dangerous people. These are killers. They kill a lot of people, and they don’t even think about it. They wake up the next morning, they don’t even think about it. This is the extreme left’s agenda for America. They want to appoint radical prosecutors, judges, and federal officials who will set criminals free. Their stated plan is to cut police funding, abolish cash bail, close down prisons, reeducate our children, preach left-wing social justice, establish a national sanctuary for criminal illegal aliens, and abolish the death penalty, even for cop killers. No one will be safe, and in fact, they want very much to let people in prison, like as an example, the Boston bomber, they want to let everybody vote. If you’re in prison, if you’re the Boston bomber, they want you to have a vote. I don’t know. I don’t think that sells too well. My administration has a very different approach. We want states to work with us to deploy the National Guard to quell the unrest. All they have to do is call us. We will have the National Guard… We’re prepared. We’re ready to go no matter where they may call from. Any part of the country, East coast, West coast, doesn’t matter. We’re ready to move immediately as we did in Minneapolis. We are ready to move as quickly as you can imagine. Tomorrow I’m going to a place where we move very quickly. You know that in Wisconsin and we move very, very quickly. And as soon as we move, that was the end of that. It was very well-behaved. I’ll appoint more tough on crime prosecutors, supports different penalties and longer jail terms for rioters, and support effective policing methods that are proven to be great crime reducers. When you enforce the law, order follows, and we need order. We need order. You can’t have cities run like these cities are run. They gave a little, then they gave a little, then they gave a little more, and all of a sudden they’ve lost these cities. But I’ll get them back very quickly. All they have to do is say, “Please come in.” As you know, they have to ask, unless we go a much tougher route, which we could, but you don’t like to do that. They have to ask you to come in. When they ask me to come in, we’ll be there within a matter of minutes. When I signed the executive order outlining 10 year prison sentences as an example for destroying monuments and statues, it immediately stopped. That was three months ago or so. I signed an order and it said 10 years in prison, 10 years if you knock down a statue. It immediately stopped. I mean, to the best of my knowledge. I haven’t seen it happening for about that time. They were going to have a big march on Washington. They canceled that march. They said 10 years is too long. Before the outbreak of left-wing extremism, our strategy produced a historic reduction in violent crime in the last two years. Of the Obama administration, murder increased 30% in major American cities. And we witnessed a largest two year nationwide increase in murder in over a half a century. In the first two years of my presidency, the number of murders went down significantly. Earlier this year, we announced that Operation Legend, surging federal law enforcement to cities plagued by violent crime, and we did a lot of it. We did a lot of it very quietly, but we did a lot. Since the beginning of Operation Legend, we have conducted more than 1000 arrests and reduced the murder rate in Kansas City, which is one of the cities we targeted, by one third. Cut it down 33%. In the last month alone, we cut the murder rate in Chicago in half. People don’t know that, but we sent them in to Chicago without fanfare at all, but we cut it down in half. It’s still far too high. And if they’d asked for full help, as opposed to just sending in some very talented people, we’d be able to cut it down to a very low number. While I am president, we will defend the rights of law-abiding citizens. We will honor the heroes who keep America safe, and we do. We honor our police. We honor our law enforcement. I have the privilege of having gotten, I guess, most every law enforcement group in the country that I can think of, the sheriffs in Florida, all of them, law enforcement in Ohio, in Texas, North Carolina. I mean, almost no matter where you look, I think I’ve gotten all of it. We’ll have to do a little study so I’m totally accurate, but I would say all of it. And the ones who didn’t, I think we have to look at them. Where do they come from? So we’ve done a real job. We’re ready, willing, and able to help these Democrat-run cities that are doing poorly. They have to call and ask. All they have to do is call. They don’t even have to put it in writing. We’ll put it in writing later. We’ll get them in there, and we’ll straighten out the city very quickly, whichever city we may be talking about. So those governors that are responsible for a state that has a city that’s got a lot of problems, call me, or the mayor can call me, and we’ll be there very quickly. Tomorrow we’re making that trip to Wisconsin. I think a lot of you are going to be going, and it should be very interesting. It should be very interesting. But we’re proud of it because in six days it’s been like a different world. And it took place immediately. As soon as we surged, as soon as we went in, it took place immediately. Okay, please. Thank you. No, because Kenosha was something we did a good job on. The governor didn’t want us there. He didn’t want the National Guard, as you know. He was very reluctant. But I give him credit because ultimately he said yes, and as soon as he said yes, the problem ended. But I have to see the people that did such a good job for me, and we’re meeting with numerous people. We have tremendous support in the state of Wisconsin, so I promised them when it all gets taken care of we’ll go. Well, it could also increase enthusiasm, and it could increase love and respect for our country. And that’s why I’m going because they did a fantastic job. As soon as I called and told them, “Let’s go,” the whole problem stopped. That was, what, six days ago. Yeah, Jeff? Well, I spoke with the pastor, wonderful man, the family’s pastor, and I thought it would be better not to do anything where there are lawyers involved. They wanted me to speak, but they wanted to have lawyers involved, and I thought that was inappropriate so I didn’t do that. But I did speak with the pastor of the family who is a fine man, a wonderful man, and I think we had a great talk. I may at some point do that, but they did have a lawyer that wanted to be on the phone. And I said, “No, that’s inappropriate,” but I just gave my best regards. But again, I spoke with the pastor. Yeah, please. Well, I understand they had large numbers of people that were supporters, but that was a peaceful protest. And paint as a defensive mechanism, paint is not bullets-Your supporters, and they are your supporters indeed, shot a young gentleman and killed him, not with paint, but with a bullet, and I think it’s disgraceful. These people, they protested peacefully. They went in very peacefully. And I’ll tell you what they’re protesting. They’re protesting… When they turn on television or read whatever they may be reading and they see a city like Chicago, where 78 people were shot and 13 died, or a city like New York, where the crime rate has gone through the roof, or a city like Portland, where the entire city is ablaze all the time and the mayor says, “We don’t want any help from the federal government,” when these people turn that on and they see that, they say, “This is not our country. This is not our country.” That was a peaceful protest, totally. Okay. Go ahead, please. Yeah, go ahead, please. Go ahead, please. Excuse me? Excuse me? We’re looking at all of it. That was an interesting situation. You saw the same tape as I saw. He was trying to get away from them, I guess, it looks like, and he fell. And then they very violently attacked him, and it was something that we’re looking at right now, and it’s under investigation. But I guess he was in very big trouble. He probably would have been killed, but it’s under investigation. I’d like to see law enforcement take care of everything. I think everything should be taken care of, law enforcement. But again, we have to give our cops back, our police back their dignity, the respect. They’re very talented people. They’re strong. They’re tough. They can do the job, but we’ve taken it away. We don’t want to have… When somebody makes a mistake, he chokes… Or in some cases you have bad cops, we have to take care of that. In other cases, they choke. They have a quarter of a second, a quarter of a second to make a decision. And sometimes they make the wrong decision. If they make the wrong decision, you know if they make the wrong decision in the other direction, they’re probably dead. So they choke sometimes, and that goes on the evening news for weeks. And the thousands and tens of thousands of great things they do, nobody covers that. Nobody writes about that. But if they make a mistake… And again, the bad cops, everybody agrees, they have to be very tough on bad cops. But sometimes you have a cop or a police person who is a good police person, right? Good, but they choke. The timing and they go through this and they study this and they work on it all the time. They literally have a quarter of a second to make some of these decisions. And they make a wrong decision, and it’s very devastating. But I will say this, I honor law enforcement. We wouldn’t be here right now if it wasn’t for law enforcement. We have to stop this horrible left-wing ideology that seems to be permeating our country. And basically, it’s weakness. It’s weakness on behalf of Democrat politicians. The Republicans, we don’t have problems. You take a look at our cities, our cities are doing very well. They’re safe. They’re secure. I spent a lot of time in Texas, as you know, just a couple of days ago. I was with the governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, he was explaining they wouldn’t put up with it for a minute. They just don’t have the kind of problems that other people have. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.

"48","09-01-20","Let them come in please. Great job. Great. Thank you for the tour. That’s something. Yeah, no, it was a great honor. If you feel more comfortable, you’ll say a couple of words, you might want to take the masks off. Otherwise, you can leave them. On either way you want. Look how fast you took that off. Well, thank you very much everybody for being here. We took a really incredible tour and law enforcement has just done such a great job working with the National Guard and working with a lot of people, but we’re here to show our support for Kenosha and Wisconsin. The state of Wisconsin has been very good to me. I love the people. We’ve done a lot for the state and we will continue to do a lot for the state. We’re all in this together. And this was an example of what can happen when you do it right. I’m pleased to be joined today by Attorney General Bill Barr, who’s doing really a fantastic job. And Bill, thank you very much for being here. Secretary Chad Wolf. Chad. Chad, thank you. Ron Johnson, Senator Ron Johnson, who’s outstanding I have to tell you. So respected within the beautiful halls of Congress. And I appreciate the great job you do Ron. I hope the people of Wisconsin appreciate how good a senator he is. Do they have any idea? Do they know how good he is? I think they do. You’re never going to get not elected Ron or I’ll be very unhappy. One of the best. And also a young Congressman that’s been a warrior, true warrior. Has been a fighter not only for some other very good causes, but for this cause because he was the first one to call me and say, “We have a problem.” And Brian, I want to thank you. Brian Style Congressmen. And you have your first reelection and I think you’re going to win it big. I hope you do. You deserve to. Also my former chief of staff. Where’s Reince? Reince. Where is my Reince? Reince Priebus, which shows that I definitely like this state because you are a very proud citizen of right here. You’re still here. You never left, did you? You never would leave. You’ve done a great job. Thank you very much Reince. Kenosha has been ravaged by anti-police and anti-American riots. They have been hit so hard and we were able to get involved. David Beth and Daniel Miskinus, who I’ve been watching a lot on television. Now today I got to know them both very well and they have done an incredible job and you’re going to say a few words in a couple of minutes and we would appreciate it. Also Zach Rodriguez, Supervisor Kenosha County, Zach. Thank you very much, Zack. Good job. You had a rough three days, but then it got well brought into backend where you wanted it, just where you wanted it. Aaron Decker, Supervisor for Kenosha. Aaron. Thank you Aaron. Good job. Thank you very much. Don Cappola, President of Wisconsin Fraternal Order of Police. Don. Thank you very much. Jerry Johnson, National Trustee of the Wisconsin Fraternal Order of Police.

And you’re really a very respected man and I really enjoyed our conversation. Thank you both very much for being here. Appreciate it. We also have Major General Paul Knapp who is around here someplace, but he was really right on the… Thank you very much, Paul. Thank you. He has been fantastic. Paul and Scott and Linda Carpenter, owners of B&L Office Furniture. Scott, you’re back there someplace. Thank you. Thank you very much. You got hit pretty hard, right? You got hit pretty hard. That’s all right. It’s going to get rebuilt. Kimberly Warner, owner of the Authentic Gifts and Report Candle Factory. That’s a very fancy name you have there, report. That’s a fancy name, but I’ll bet it was beautiful. Are you going to rebuild? Will you be rebuilding? Well, we’ll be giving you some help. Okay. We’ll be giving you some help. John Rhode III, owner of Rhode’s Camera Shop. Now I was there and that was 109 years. And you want to say a couple of words. Would you like to? Where is he? Oh, okay, good. John, stand up please. 109 years. And we’re going to help you. That’s a very, very complete rebuild we’re talking about down there. That’s incredible. If they would have responded to the first call, it would’ve been a little different story, but they did respond, which is better than some governors, frankly. And once they responded and once we took control of it, things went really well. You just met some very talented people outside and I think you’re going to have clear sailing, but we’re going to try giving you a hand. Your insurance company, your insured, right? And so they're helping and they're being responsible? You’ll let me know. You’ll let me know. You got to let me know at the end. And Ricky [Talapayatra 00:06:03]. Talapayatra. That’s a beauty. That's a good one. Go ahead please. All right, we’ll be talking to you. We’re going to be helping you with law enforcement. We’re going to be helping you with some economic development get it back in shape. Get Kenosha back in shape and we’ll get it back in I think very quickly. I really think so. And we’ll be helped by John Morrissey, City Administrator of Kenosha. John, thank you very much, John. You have your work cut out for the next little while, but you’ll be fine. You’re going to be in great shape. And Samantha Kirkman, State Representative District 61. Thank you very much. Congratulations on doing a really great job. Thank you. Thank you. Great job you’re doing. Appreciate it. And Van Wanguard, State Senator District 21. Highly respected person, actually. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Well, thank you. And your reputation’s a great one so thank you very much. And also this area is a special area. We can’t let that happen to this area. So we got here quickly and did the job. Violent mobs demolished or damaged at least 25 businesses, burned down public buildings, and threw bricks at police officers, which your police officers won’t stand for and they didn’t stand for it. These are not acts of peaceful protest, but really domestic terror. My administration coordinated with the state and local authorities to very, very swiftly deploy the National Guard surge federal law enforcement to Kenosha and stop the violence. And I strongly support the use of the National Guard in other cities. And the same thing would be happening if we did that. You’d have the same thing happened in Portland. It would happen very quickly. It would all be over very, very quickly. And I just want to thank the two of you for acting so strongly and so bravely and getting it done and the coordination has been fantastic. You still need that coordination no matter how people you send in. I just came from a visit of one of the businesses that was burned down, B&L Furniture and the great 109 year old camera shop, which I really respect because that had a reputation far beyond the state even and it’s terrible to see. Several other business owners, they’re joining us and we have some in the back also. To stop the political violence, we must also confront the radical ideology that includes this violence. Reckless far-left politicians continue to push the destructive message that our nation and our law enforcement are oppressive or racist. They’ll throw out any word that comes to them. Actually, we must give far greater support to our law enforcement. It’s all about giving them additional support. These are great people. These are great, great people. These are brave people. They’re fighting to save people that they’d never met before in many cases. And they’re incredible. We must really be thankful that we have them and we have to help them do their jobs. We can’t be threatening them with their pensions are going to be taken away. Their jobs going to be taken away. Everything’s going to be taken away. They’re going to be living a bad life if they utter an incorrect word. You can’t do it. We have to have our law enforcement. We cherish our law enforcement. We wouldn’t be here without our law enforcement. Even me, I’m here today. I feel so safe. And you went through hell just a few days ago, but I feel so safe. I better be safe. I better be safe, but we’re all safe. And we’re safe because of law enforcement and we honor you. And I will say this, we have to condemn the dangerous anti-police rhetoric. It’s getting more and more. It’s very unfair. You have some bad apples. We all know that. And those will be taken care of through the system. And nobody’s going to be easy on them either. And you have people that choke. They’re under a tremendous… I said it yesterday. I said it last night, they’re under tremendous pressure. And they may be there for 15 years and have a spotless record and all of a sudden they’re faced with a decision. They have a quarter of a second, quarter of a second to make a decision. And if they make a wrong decision one way or the other, they’re either dead or they’re in big trouble. And people have to understand that they choke sometimes. And it’s a very tough situation, right? It’s a very tough. Then people call them bad and horrible and they made a bad decision, but if you think of it, when they have… And I know you practice this all the time, where you give people literally a quarter of a second to make a decision and a lot of them can’t make that right decision. It’s a very tough thing to do. The vast and overwhelming majority of police officers are honorable, courageous, and devoted public servants. They’re incredible yet many politicians ignore their sacrifice and ignore the African American and Hispanic American victims. We have people. There was love on the streets, I can tell you of Wisconsin when we were coming in. There was love in the streets. And so many African Americans, Hispanic Americans, I can see waving. Pastor, it was so beautiful to see. They want to have safety. They want to have safety. I’m not a huge believer in polls, obviously, but you look at polls where there’s 87% want to have great police. They want to have strong police. They want to have safety. They are the ones that are most affected by tragedies like you’ll see going around. When these allegations of police wrongdoing and when you see that they have made allegations, they must be fully and fairly investigated. And that’s what we’re doing. Bill Barr’s done a fantastic job in that respect. And we fully understand that because you do have problems the other way, but there are very few. The sad thing is you can do 10,000 great jobs as a police man or a police woman. You can do an incredible job for years, and then you have one bad apple, or something happens that’s bad, and that’s the nightly news for three weeks. That’s all they talk about. They don’t talk about the thousands and thousands of good jobs, the lives that you saved, they never talk about. So I’m committed to helping Kenosha rebuild, we all are. We will provide $1 million to the Kenosha law enforcement so that you have some extra money to go out and do what you have to do. It was a rough week, to put it mildly, and you’ve done it incredibly well. I’m also providing nearly $4 million to support the small businesses that I talked about today that got burned up, burned down, and we’re going to be providing over $42 million to support public safety statewide, including direct support for law enforcement, and funding for additional prosecutors to punish criminals and resources, to provide services to victims of crime, and that was Bill Barr who wanted that money put in. So that’s $42 million that’ll help with prosecutors and all of the other things that are so important to you. You need that, because when you grab them and then nothing happens, and they’re back on the street, that doesn’t work out too well. My administration is restoring public safety. We’re hiring more police, surging tough on crime federal prosecutors, increasing penalties for assaulting law enforcement, and for dismantling Antifa. They don’t want to mention the word Antifa. Nobody mentions that there’s a bad group of people. Very, very bad, very dangerous group of people, and we are doing a big number on Antifa. They’re bad. Earlier this year, we announced Operation Legend to surge federal law enforcement to high crime neighborhoods. It is a thing that has really worked out amazingly well, Bill, but it’s really understated, in a sense. We’ve already conducted more than 1,000 arrests in our first month in Chicago, we went to Chicago very recently. Obviously, that’s been a disaster, Chicago, total disaster, with again, radical left Democrat, and we just have to… It’s all Democrat, everything’s Democrat. All of these problems are Democrat cities. We don’t want to say it, but it is. The top 10 are Democrat. Then you go into the top 25, and take a look at that. It’s the same thing. We cut the number of murders in Chicago last month in half, still way too many, but Operation Legend was very, very, very successful. Now it’s just really getting going, but they cut it in half, and just at its very early stage. This is in sharp contrast to those who want to slash police funding, oppose using the National Guard, and want to hire radical judges and prosecutors who will release rioters, looters, and criminals. We have that in Portland, where the prosecutors don’t want to do anything. You can catch somebody doing the worst crime, and they don’t want to do anything, so we’re very, very upset about that. So we’re not going to cut police funding. If you look at what they want to do, they want to cut police funding. We want to increase police funding substantially. They want to end cash bail, which has been a killer for New York. If you look at what’s happening in New York, they allowed thousands of people out of jail in New York, and they’re walking around and they’re causing nothing but problems. Who would not know that? You don’t have to know anything about policing. I’m not a policeman, but I would know that if you let these people out, many of them are going to cause tremendous problems. So they want to end cash bail, incentivize prison closures, they want to close the prison so that you can’t hold anybody. Reimagine public safety, end immigration enforcement, resume catch and release at the border. As Chad will tell you, we’ve had tremendous success on the border. We’re up to over 300 miles of border wall, and we’re having the best year we’ve ever had in the border. People are coming in, but they only come in legally, or for the most part, they only come in legally. The wall will be finished very shortly, it’s had a tremendous impact. So, and the other thing, we want to appoint Supreme Court justices and judges, we’ll be up to almost 300 judges by the end of the term, and two Supreme Court justices. And so, we have a lot of things to do. We have a lot of great things to do, but it’s an honor to be in your neighborhood, it’s an honor to be in your great state, Wisconsin, and we’re here for you all the way. Some people thought it would be a good thing for me to come, a bad thing. I just wanted to come. I really came today to thank law enforcement, and to just really… What you’ve done has been incredible. It’s been really inspiring, because you see it happening all over and it just never seems to end, and it never seems to end because it’s almost as though they don’t want it to end, because you ended it really fast. And Congressman, I want to thank you for the job you did. You were the first call, and I want to thank you very much, Brian. Really great job. With that, I’d like to introduce Bill Barr, Attorney General of the United States to say a few words. Thank you. Thank you very much. You’re doing a great job. Thank you. Senator Ron Johnson, from your wonderful state, and he’s one of the great senators, I can tell you that in the US Senate. He’s one of the best. Ron, please. Thank you very much, Ron. Appreciate it. Congressman, please. Bryan Steil? Good. Thank you Brian. Great job. David Beth, sheriff, please? Thank you Sheriff. I’ll tell you, you’ve done a great job and just if they’re watching, Portland or Chicago or New York or any one of other cities that we’re talking about, Portland probably would be so easy. Maybe that will be the first one because I see it every night, it’s on the news, it’s burning. They’re always playing games and I don’t know, then he gets up and says, “We’re trying to work together,” the whole thing is … [inaudible 00:31:12] want to burn down his house last night, the mayor, but we’re ready, willing and able to send in a massive group of people that are really highly trained. You saw that –With your experience, right? We could solve that problem in less than an hour in Portland so I hope they call. Eventually they’ll call and at some point Bill, we’ll just have to do it ourselves. We’re going to have to do something that’s … I think the people will be extremely happy with. Maybe the mayor won’t and maybe the governor won’t but I don’t know if they know what they’re doing. I just … So sad to watch it happen, but here you acted and acted appropriately. Please Daniel, go ahead. That's right. Thank you Daniel. Great job you did, thank you, and you two worked together beautifully. It’s truly good. Really good job. Please. Really nice. Thank you. Pastors, would you like to say a prayer. I’d love to have that because you are so highly thought of in the area so please, James, share. Please. Thank you very much. Sharon, would you like to say something? That's really put. Yes James? So you know what I think? I think you're an incredible couple, I really do. And thank you very much for being here. Really great, beautiful. Do you have any questions, please? Yeah. No, it’s not, it’s just that we’re tired of watching every night with Portland. They’re on night 104 now, and we’re tired of watching it because it could be solved in an hour. And we’re tired of watching a mayor that has no clue what’s going on. And people are calling our office, and people are calling Washington that live in Portland and live in the state. And they’re saying, “Please send help.” And the governor… We used to call the governor often and they say, “No, we don’t need your help.” But I say, “Your community is burning down.” They don’t need our help. Now, I don’t know if that’s political, I don’t know what is going on, certainly not common sense, but we could solve it just like here. We all worked together, we came in, the federal government, the state government, the city government, everybody worked together, the senator, the congressman, it was a beautiful thing, it just came… It just worked. And it was done almost instantly, people were amazed. And as you probably will have to report, maybe people are surprised, there’s been zero problem in terms of your safety, our safety, I feel so safe. Four or five days ago, James, we couldn’t have done this, the law enforcement has been so great. And we could do this in Portland so quickly, so easily, it would be incredible. We would have done it in Seattle. We were all set to go into Seattle as you know, the following day, and they heard that and they sent the police, and the police did a good job, but they… The people gave up, they were exhausted, they were there for a long time and they gave up, they were exhausted. So, we’re there. I mean, we’d love to help Oregon, we’d love to help, really love to help, Portland. Because we could solve that problem so easily. We have the people, they’re ready they could be there in less than an hour, and it would all end. And they got a glimpse of that in this great state, they got a really good glimpse of it, it happened very quickly. And now… I mean, I see it, they’re already rebuilding, you’re already rebuilding your stores, you’ll be rebuilding your store soon, your camera shop. So, we don’t want to do that, but at some point we’re going to have to do it, okay? Well, I feel terribly for anybody that goes through that, that’s why I was so honored to meet the pastors. As you know, it’s under investigation, it’s a big thing happening right now, I guess it’s under local investigation, I know, [Barr 00:03:19], you’re also participating, but it’s under your local investigation group unit. And I hope they come up with the right answer, it’s a complicated subject to be honest with you, but I feel terribly for anybody that has to go through. And I didn’t get to speak to the mother, I hear she’s a fine woman, I’ve heard that from the pastor, a really fine woman. But, you can see when I spoke to the pastors, I see exactly what it is and they understand where I am. And if we can help, we’re going to help. But, it is a question, it’s under investigation. A lot of things happened with that and other things, frankly, that we’re looking at very, very closely. Okay? A body cam? Well, that’s very interesting. Let me ask, Barr, to answer that question. Go ahead, Barr. It’s a very tough… It’s a very… The whole thing with a body cam, you read it and you read two sides of the story, how do you feel about it, Daniel? You think they're good? But you overall...How about you? Okay. So, you'll be having them? Okay, good. They like them. You're going to have to speak up, please. No, I don’t believe that. I think the police do an incredible job. And I think you do have some bad apples, I think you’d agree every once in a while you’ll see something. And you do have the other situation too, where they’re under this tremendous pressure and they don’t handle it well, they call it choking, and it happens. And no, but I don’t believe that at all. I think there… I’ve met so many police, I have the endorsement of so many, maybe everybody, and frankly, I think they’re incredible people, they want to do the right thing. It’s a tough job, it’s a dangerous job. But I have to say this to the police, the people of our country love you. You don’t hear that, you don’t hear it from them, but the people of our country love you and they respect you, and they… And you know it, you feel it in your heart or you wouldn’t be doing it, but there’s a great love. And when they see what goes on… And when they see a case like this where it solves so quickly, they respect the police a lot, really a lot. So, you should hear it at least. Well, you just keep getting back to the opposite subject. We should talk about the kind of violence that we’ve seen in Portland and here and other places, it’s tremendous violence. You always get to the other side, well, what do you think about this or that? The fact is that we’ve seen tremendous violence and we will put it out very, very quickly if given the chance, and that’s what this is all about. I keep hearing about peaceful protests, I hear it about everything, and then I come into an area like this and I see the town is burned down. I mean, you look at Minneapolis, they should have acted much quicker, when we got the National Guard and it took literally half an hour. You saw the scene, they formed, they walked, it was over, and they haven’t had a problem of any consequence since. Their police weren’t allowed to do the job that they could do, they have a very good police department, but they weren’t allowed. Now they want to break it up, they want to end it, they don’t want to have a police department. They want to not only defund, they want to get rid of it, it’s ridiculous. So, I just say this, that the kind of violence that I saw… You may have protestors, but you have some really bad people too, you have anarchists, and you have the looters, and you have the riders, you have all types, you have agitators, and that’s what you should be focusing on with your question. I keep hearing about peaceful protest, it’s become… Really, I think it’s hurt the media very badly because you’ll have somebody standing on one of the networks, I won’t say which one, but there are more than one, many of them saying how it’s a peaceful protest and over the shoulder you see the whole place is burning down, it’s become a pretty common site. So, I don’t view the peaceful protest. I think peaceful protesting is fantastic, I think it’s great. But, by and large, this is not peaceful protest when you walk into an area and you see buildings that have burned down. And fortunately, here we stopped it early and so the damage is relatively minimal. But when you look at some of these areas that they just don’t ask for the help, they refuse to allow us to go in and help them, and by the time you get there the place is disintegrated. And then they say it was a peaceful protest, it’s not a peaceful protest and you shouldn’t call it a peaceful protest. One more, please. Say it again. You're going to have to speak up, sir. Well, I think people are calling for structural change and then you could take the people of Kenosha that aren’t here and that you won’t see and that aren’t protesting, but they want change also, they want to see law and order, that’s the change they want. They want the police to be police, they want the police to do what they do better than anybody else in the world, and that’s what they want too. You don’t see them marching and you don’t see them on the streets, but what they want is they want great police force, they want people that are going to keep them safe, where their houses aren’t broken into, where they’re not raped and murdered, that’s what they want. And they’re protesters too, but they don’t walk down the street, up and down the street. So, just the way it is. So I want to thank you all and I’ll see you back at the plane. Thank you very much. Great job, fantastic job. Thank you everybody. Thank you very much, appreciate everything.

"49","09-02-20","They had some interesting polls. I don’t know, do I like it or don’t I like it, I guess I probably do, but they say no matter what it is, there are more votes for Trump because a lot of people say, “Just leave me alone, I’m going to vote the way I want to vote.” And then they go and they vote for Trump. On your ballots, if you get the unsolicited ballots, send it in and then go make sure it counted, and if it doesn’t tabulate, you vote. You just vote. And then if they tabulate it very late, which they shouldn’t be doing, they’ll see you voted so it won’t count. So send it in early and then go and vote and if it’s not tabulated, you vote and the vote is going to count. You can’t let them take your vote away. These people are playing dirty politics, dirty politics. So if you have an absentee ballot, or as I call it a solicited ballot, you send it in, but I would check it in any event. I would go and follow it and go vote. And everybody here wants to vote. We vote the old fashioned way. You know, we voted in World War I, we voted in World War II. We’re going to see some great World War II heroes right now, but we voted in World War II and today they want to give everybody ballots. And every place where they’ve done it it’s been a mess. It’s been a mess. They don’t know where they are, they don’t know who they’re sending them to. It’s a terrible thing. Follow your ballot and vote. That’s very important, I think everybody understands. Take care North Carolina, we have to win it big. So we just got a poll, we’re up seven in Georgia, we’re up a lot everywhere. I think a lot everywhere."
"50","09-03-20","Thank you very much. We had a very successful day. Pennsylvania was incredible. The crowd was incredible. You saw what was unable to get in. We had thousands of people unable to get in. And I appreciate everybody being there. That was really a terrific moment, I think, coming off the plane. It doesn’t get any bigger than that. I did hear though, when reentering the plane, I was told by Mark and Hope and some others that some horrible things were said. Fake things. Fake news. Corrupt news. The kind of news that’s ruining your profession. And everyone knows it’s totally false. General Keith Kellogg, who’s a highly respected man, couldn’t believe when he heard it. And he knows everything about all of it. And to think that I would make statements negative to our military and our fallen heroes when nobody’s done what I’ve done with the budgets, with the military budgets, with getting pay raises for our military. It is a disgraceful situation by a magazine that’s a terrible magazine. I don’t read it, but I just heard about it. They made it up, and probably it’s a couple of people that have been failures in the administration that I got rid of, and I couldn’t get rid of them fast enough. Or it was just made up. But it’s unthinkable. As far as John McCain is concerned, I was never a fan. I will admit that openly. I disagreed with him on the endless wars. I disagreed with him with respect to the vets and the taking care of the VA. I wanted to do it a much different way, and I think it’s proven to be a much more successful way when you look at the success we’ve had with the VA and with our vets with choice and with accountability, all the things I’ve got. So I disagreed with John McCain, but I still respected him. And I had to approve his funeral as president. We lowered the flags. I had to approve that. Nobody else. I had to approve it. When you think, and I’m just thinking back, I had to approve either Air Force One or a military plane to go to Arizona to pick up his casket. I approved it immediately. I had to approve the funeral because he had a first-class AAA funeral that lasted for nine days, by the way. I had to approve it. All of that had to be approved by the president. I approved it without hesitation, without complaint. And I felt he deserved it. I disagreed with him on things, and he was a tough guy, but I felt he deserved it. For somebody to say the things that they say I said is a total lie. It’s fake news. It’s a disgrace. And frankly, it’s a disgrace to your profession. Now, with all of that being said, you’ll speak to Keith Kellogg. You’ll speak to other people, because many people knew. Let me just go into the trip to Europe and to France. I was ready to go to a ceremony. I had two of them, one the following day. It was pouring. I went to that. But the helicopter could not fly. The reason it couldn’t fly, because it was ranting about as hard as I’ve ever seen. And on top of that, it was very, very foggy, and the helicopter was unable to fly. It was a fairly long helicopter flight, but it was a very long drive. In order for me to go, we would have had to leave immediately and go through very busy areas of, I guess, Paris, but a very, very heavily traveled area, a big city. I think it was Paris. The Secret Service told me, “You can’t do it.” I said, “I have to do it. I want to be there.” They said, “You can’t do it. We’ll get you confirmation of this. For you to do that, make that trip not by helicopter flying over everything, we have to work with the police. We have to work with everything.” And I think you’ll find on record in the police force in the areas that we’re talking about, areas of Paris that we’re talking about, I think you’ll find on record requests, and we actually have Secret Service that I’m going to ask to give you details. They said, “You can’t do it.” It was two and a half hours or two hours of driving. It was a long drive. They said, “You can’t do it.” So I said, “No, I want to do it.” They said, “You can’t.” There was no way I would’ve been able to do it. And they would never have been able to get the police and everybody else in line to have a president go through a very crowded, very congested area. So I went and I called home. I spoke to my wife. I said, “I hate this. I came here to go to that ceremony,” and to the one that was the following day, which I did go to. I said, “I feel terribly.” And that was the end of it. Now, all of a sudden, somebody makes up this horrible story that I didn’t want to go. And then they make up an even worse story, an even worse story calling certain names to our fallen heroes. It’s a disgrace that a magazine is able to write it. If they really exist, if people really exist that would have said that they’re low lives and they’re liars. And I would be willing to swear on anything that I never said that about our fallen heroes. There is nobody that respects them more. So I just think it’s a horrible, horrible thing. We made a great evening into, frankly, a very sad evening when I see a statement like that. No animal, nobody, what animal would say such a thing? And especially since I’ve done more, I think, than almost anybody to help our military, to get the budgets of our military, to get the pay raises for our military. I just think it’s a horrible thing that they’re allowed to write that. We can refute it. We have other people that will refute it. The one I would like you to speak to is General Keith Kellogg, because he knows exactly the story, but you can also speak to Secret Service. They wouldn’t let me go, no matter what happened, because of security, because of safety. I want to thank you for being here. There’s nothing much more that I could say. All they’re trying to do is influence a presidential election where we’ve gone very high in the polls in the last short period of time, where we’re doing very well, where we’re going to win, and they’re going crazy. The magazine in question is a never Trumper magazine, probably doing badly. I know nothing about it. I don’t read it. I just heard about it now, about this story. But it’s a total never Trumper magazine, and other people that are trying to influence the outcome of a presidential election. And you know what? People are to smart for it. And somebody has to make a stand. This fake press is a disgrace. Thank you very much, everybody.

"51","09-04-20","Thank you. So as we begin Labor Day weekend, America’s unprecedented economic recovery continues. You see what’s going on. It’s been pretty amazing. The United States economy added today, announced this morning, 1.4 million jobs last month, bringing the total to over 10.6 million jobs created in just four months. That’s a record by far. In August, we added 249,000 retail jobs, 174,000 leisure and hospitality jobs, and 29,000 new manufacturing jobs. The unemployment rate plummeted to 8.4%, the second largest single month drop ever recorded, surpassed only by our big decline in June. Last month, we saw large declines in the unemployment rate for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans. Very big declines. We’re witnessing the fastest labor market recovery from any economic crisis in history, by far. By contrast, the last administration had the slowest, weakest, and worst recovery in American history. That was well-documented, as you know. This year, the United States has seen the smallest economic contraction of any major western nation. And we are recovering at a much faster rate than any other nation business. Business confidence is higher today in America than in any other G7 or EU country. That covers a lot of territory. So we have the business confidence is higher than many in any of those countries. In July retail sales, not only recovered, but reached a new all time high. So think of that. Retail sales, that’s a very basic statistic, and it’s a big statistic. It not only recovered, but reach the highest level ever. Auto sales have surged to an incredible 74% since their April low and are nearly back to their pre-virus levels. And that’s been a tremendous thing. Used cars and new cars have been both doing incredibly well. Mortgage applications with 27% higher in August. Then during the same period last year, home builder sentiment reached the highest level on record indicating that more high paying construction jobs are on the way. Home building has been great and lending has been really incredible. US manufacturing activity reached a 19 month high in August. While my administration has fought every day to restore prosperity, however, Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats in Congress are holding additional China virus relief hostage to reasons that nobody understands. I guess I do. I think I understand, it’s called politics. And speaking of politics, I think North Carolina, I think that Michigan and Pennsylvania and other states, they should open the governor’s, the Democrat governors should open the states. They’ll open them on November 4th, but they should open them now. It’s very unfair to the people to have those shutdowns continuing at the level that they continuing. Democrats are insisting on a massive taxpayer bailout of badly run blue states, stimulus checks for illegal aliens, and the mass release of inmates from jail. They want to release a lot of inmates, some of them for very serious reasons. They want to release them from jail. They want that as part of a stimulus package. Can you believe it? It’s time for the Democrats in Congress to start working across the aisle and put the American people first. Now, we have $300 million in an account that we didn’t use. $300 million, and we are willing to use that. I would be willing to release it subject to Congress and use that as stimulus money. And it would go right to the American people. So we have $300 billion sitting in an account that we didn’t need because things are going so well with the economy, but it would be a very appropriate thing to release that to the American people. And I am willing to do it. All we need is a sign off, but that doesn’t mean that we’re going to release prisoners. Some prisoners, some very vicious people, actually. We’re not going to put them on the streets like the Democrats want us to, and we’re not going to give stimulus checks to illegal aliens. They came into the country illegally, and now we give them a check. We want to give the checks to the American people. So remember we have $300 million, it’s there. We don’t need the money. We don’t need anything. Just let that money get released to the American people. As our economy rebounds, there’s only one thing that could stop the extraordinary economic comeback and wipe out the future of American workers, and that’s what the Democrats want to do with a $4 trillion tax hike, implementing things that will be really bad for our country. And this will just absolutely cripple what we’re doing on regulations and so many other elements of success. We had the greatest economy in history prior to the China virus coming in. Now, they want to stop regulations. They want to bring up regulations to a level stop. The things that we’re doing, which are at a much smaller level and bring up regulations at a level that nobody’s ever seen before. They want to do things that will make it impossible for any economy to grow. They want to ban fracking. And as you saw ban ban ban, and all of a sudden he sees his polls going down. And now he says, “Well, I was only talking about not maybe banning fracking,” but he wants to ban fracking. And it doesn’t matter what he wants to ban. The people that control him want to ban fracking. And whether it’s Pennsylvania, Texas, Oklahoma, North Dakota, so many other states, you can’t ban fracking. That would be a disaster. Ohio. Want to abolish America and energy. I mean, that’s, what’s going to happen. Adopt disastrous trade deals and inflict a devastating shutdown. As you know, he said “We want to shut it down.” And we would be willing to shut it down. And you don’t shut down when we’re setting records. And by the way, we’re rounding the corner. We’re rounding the corner on the virus. Joe Biden’s blanket shutdown would collapse our economy would cause countless deaths from suicide, drug, alcohol abuse, heart disease, and more. Shutdowns cause a lot of problems, a lot of very serious problems, more so than the virus itself. Biden’s plan is not a solution, it’s a virtual surrender. And our country is doing so well. We’re starting to do so well. I think we’re going to have a great third quarter. I mean, you’re going to see it for yourself because the numbers will be announced sometime prior to the election on November 3rd. And as you know, Joe spent his entire career sending American jobs to China and other far, far away countries. For 47 years, people were pillaging our country, taking our jobs, taking our companies. And that’s never going to change with that mindset and with that group. Biden is not going to be standing up to these foreign countries, he’s not going to be standing up, maybe more importantly, to the people that run the Democrat party. He doesn’t have the strength to do that. He refuses even to condemn Antifa, a bad group, a far left domestic terrorist organization. He doesn’t want to say anything bad about it. His plan to appease the domestic terrorists is the exact opposite of what I’m doing. I think you saw that last night, yesterday, the US Marshals, we sent them in, US Marshals. We were waiting for a local government to take care of it, but they didn’t do that. So the US Marshals went in law enforcement, they took down the Antifa member who murdered a man in the middle of a street in Portland. The suspect was killed after drawing a weapon when officers attempted to take them into custody. They wanted to take him into US Marshals. Incredible people. So I want to thank them for their strength, their bravery, and I really do wish that the mayor of Portland and the governor of Oregon would get going and stop the crime in that city. Be so easy to do. While we’re focused on creating good paying jobs, the radical left has focused on unleashing really violent mobs. And you see that whether you’re conservative or liberal, Republican, Democrat, or Independent, we must all agree the need for peace and order and safety. Under my administration, law enforcement is conducting arrests nationwide of rioters, looters, and domestic terrorists. The reasons we didn’t put Chicago into our list, while we’re holding back funds from some of these states and cities that are doing such a poor job, such an incompetent job, a job that nobody can even imagine how bad. And we’re holding it back until they get their act together, and we are having a lot of people in Chicago right now, and you notice that their numbers are going down rapidly, but we’ve deployed a lot of federal law enforcement inside of Chicago. And they’re taking out quite a few people and they’re being arrested. They’re being put in jail. And that’s way you see those numbers going down, that’s why you see that with respect to the mayor, we did not hold back funds in Chicago. But New York is experiencing a tremendous crime wave, in some cases up over 300%, and they have to do something quickly. We just spoke to Mayor Bowser and she’s willing to do whatever’s necessary. And we had very good talk with her. That’s in DC, and the other places they speak for themselves. We’re working with the state and local authorities to comb through hours of video tape, identify and arrest suspects and prosecute lawbreakers. We’ve already got over 300 in jail and we have tremendous evidence, and I want to thank the media for helping us out because they’re taking different angles. We have it from every different angle. You can’t probably have any better than what we’ve got. We see it from the sky, and the ground, and from the right and from the left. So when they say they didn’t do it, we say, “Well, what’s this?” So we get that from the media free of charge. Under Operation Legend, we’ve surged federal law enforcement to cities plagued by violent crime. The initiative has already resulted in tremendous success. And nationwide, we have over 2000 arrests, and we don’t talk about it too much, but now we might as well. So we’ve arrested over 2000 criminals, they’re criminals. And in a single month, the murder rate in Chicago, as you know, and as I said, it was cut in half, actually. So on the China virus front, the nations of Europe have experienced a 38% greater excess mortality than the United States. 38% more greater excess mortality than the United States. A lot of you don’t want to report that. And if we took New York out of the equation, there’s nobody even close. The job we’ve done is incredible and we don’t get any credit for it, but we’ve done an incredible job. Through Operation Warp Speed, we have three vaccines in the final stage of clinical trials. Yesterday, Pfizer announced, I just spoke to the head of Pfizer, great guy. They announced that it expects to have the results of its trial very, very shortly next month. But very shortly, we remain on track to deliver a vaccine before the end of the year and maybe even before November 1st. We think we can probably have it sometime during the month of October. And Pfizer is among the leaders, as you know, and it’s a great company. Johnson and Johnson also doing well. Moderna. We have some really great companies. They’re all doing very well. They’re all in final stages. And I think you’re going to see results that are shockingly good. Finally, I want to provide you with a brief update of the virus, cases in the United States have declined 28% nationwide over the last month. And hospitalizations and deaths have continued to decline over the past week, very substantially declined. Thanks to America’s medical genius, the mortality rate has been reduced by 85% in April, mortality rate reduced by 85%. Hospital length of stay are one third of their average length in April, so the hospitalization is down, the length of stay is way down. In order to keep making progress against the virus, we ask all Americans to remain vigilant especially over Labor Day. We have the Labor Day weekend coming upon us immediately, I guess we can say pretty immediately, and we need everybody to be careful, to apply common sense, and do all of the things that we’ve told you to do as quickly, as much as you can, social distancing, wearing a mask whenever the distancing is not possible, and staying with a group that you know. Let’s just try and get through this one weekend, and I think we have a chance of doing that, just social distance, wash your hands, all of the hygiene, things that we speak about, and we’re really rounding the turn. And the vaccines are coming, the therapeutics have already come but they continue to come. The convalescent plasma has had a tremendous impact already, you see what’s happening there, and remdesivir has been incredible. So we have a lot of things happening. We have a lot of therapeutics coming out, I think, from the standpoint of common sense, I guess therapeutics to me right now you going into a hospital you give somebody a shot or a transfusion, it might be a transfusion, probably more than 50% are actually transfusions, and they’ll leave the hospital shortly thereafter. I mean, to me that’s more important in a certain sense then the vaccine, but the vaccines will be great over the long term, the therapeutics over the short term. And also knowing you have the therapeutics, I think is great from the standpoint of the mind, that’s great. So, I want to thank everybody for being here. I’m going to ask Larry Kudlow to give a couple of examples of how strong our economy is recovering, how strongly it’s recovering, and it’s setting records at every level, and we’re doing better than every other country, and we’re very proud of all of the people for doing such an incredible job, this is a V, it’s a super V. Again, we have $300 billion ready to go, all Congress has to do is say, use it. If they say use it, I’d like to use it without their permission, but I guess I’m not allowed to do that, I did ask that question. So, Congress has to just say use it, all they have to do is say use it, $300 billion gets immediately put into our system and will really help the American people. There’s nothing else to do, just a very quick statement. So I’m going to ask Larry to come up. I want to thank another man for being here today, there’s a man that’s a incredible leader, Lou Holtz. I’ve known him for a long time, he’s been a friend of mine. And I think I’ve received letters from every football coach, almost in the nation, that’s a little exaggeration, but some of the greats, Nick Saban wrote a letter, and Coach O. And Coach O as central casting, I said we’re going to have to put him in a movie, right? As a football coach. He’d really be good playing a football coach like you. And Urban Meyer wrote a beautiful letter, and so many of the other great legendary coaches, not only coaches though, people in sports and people in life and even great political people, recommending Lou for the Presidential Medal of Freedom. And we’ve analyzed it very closely, we’ve looked at all of those recommendations, we’ve looked at Lou’s life and his career and what he’s done for charity, and the football is obvious, he was a great coach, but what he’s done beyond even coaching. So, Lou will be getting the Presidential Medal of Freedom. And the date is being picked it won’t be in the too distant future. Lou is married to a great woman, right, Lou? Great woman, and she just passed away a few months ago as an incredible woman. I knew her well, she was stronger than Lou. I think she was stronger than you, Lou. I hate to tell you, you’re strong too, but she was special, right? So, I just want to congratulate coach Lou Holtz on soon to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom. And we look forward to that, Lou, thank you very much. And you can stay around and listen to Larry for a couple of seconds or-go to your friend. You probably know half of the people in the room. I’ll bet they treat you better than they treat me, they treat him good, I wish you’d treat me that way. Larry, come on up. Thank you. Okay, please. Yeah. Yeah, what about it? Well, I am. There’s a theory that I can do it without the approval, but I’d rather get the approval so that we have it, but there’s a theory I could take the 300 billion, it’s money that we have, money that we built up, and money that we haven’t spent, and I would love to give it to the American people as a very powerful stimulus. So, yeah. I think there is a theory that I could do it without having to go back, but I think it would be appropriate to go back and I would ask Congress to approve it. It’s a very simple approval, literally, it’s a one sentence approval, and the Democrats should do that, the Republicans will do that, they’d be glad to do that. So, we’ll see whether or not they do it, okay? Please, in the back. Well, I’m honored that Delaware… Because I don’t see Biden anywhere but Delaware, he’s… And I like Delaware too, but to have the law enforcement in Delaware give their endorsement to me is really a great honor. It’s really… It just shows you how pathetic the Democrats are when it comes to crime, when it comes to law and order. So, would you please extend my very great thanks? It’s a great honor to get it from Delaware law enforcement. We’ve gotten it from almost all law enforcement, but that’s… Because every time I see Biden speak, it says Delaware, he never leaves, I’m all over the country, I’m all over the place. Yeah, please. Go ahead. Did you have… Go ahead, Well, I think we have to look at it very seriously if that’s the case, and I think we will. There’s nobody been tougher on Russia than I have. I get along with almost all countries, I get along with North Korea, remember we’re supposed to be going to war with North Korea. If Hillary got elected, you’d be at war right now with North Korea, that would be a very messy war, a very bad war, many millions of people would be killed. In the meantime, we’ve got along with them, we didn’t get to war. Everyone said that if I was elected, I’d be at war in one week, it’s been just the opposite. We’re doing very well in Afghanistan, bringing the troops down very low level, and other things are happening very interestingly. We have a great peace deal going on in the Middle East, actually, with UAE and Israel and that’s been received like probably very few things that many people have done, it’s been very well received. And we’ll be having other countries announcing soon they’re joining that, and you’re going to have a lot of countries in that. A lot of countries are saying, “Hey, why didn’t you bring us in right from the beginning?” They would have loved to have been there, but they want to be in. So, we’re doing a lot of things. I think that I was the one that alerted the United States and the world, Nord Stream 2, I said, “Why is Germany spending billions and billions of dollars to Russia to get their energy from Russia?” And then we’re supposed to protect Germany from Russia. What’s that all about? And the sanctions and everything else at the same time. With Russia, we’re right now negotiating a nuclear nonproliferation treaty, which is very important. It’s a very important thing. To me, it’s the most important thing. Some people say global warming. I don’t. I say this is far more important. And we are the biggest, they are the second, biggest nuclear-wise. China’s third. They’re actually a distant third, but they’re building pretty rapidly. And at some point, we’ll include China into those talks, but we’re doing very well with Russia on nuclear nonproliferation. So I don’t know exactly what happened. I think it’s tragic. It’s terrible, it shouldn’t happen. We haven’t had any proof yet, but I will take a look. It is interesting that everybody’s always mentioning Russia. And I don’t mind you mentioning Russia, but I think probably China at this point is a nation that you should be talking about much more so than Russia, because the things that China is doing are far worse if you take a look at what’s happening with the world. Look at what happened with the China virus. Look at what they did by not keeping that within the confines of China. They should’ve kept it in the confines of China. Look what they’ve done to 188 countries all over the world. But you never ask about China. You’re always asking about Russia. So I would be very angry if that’s the case. And we’ll take a look at the numbers and the documents, because we’re going to be sent a lot of documents over the next few days. Please, in the back? Well, I didn’t understand everything you said. I know India, and I understood those young people that you mentioned. They’re very good young people. And I know their relationship to India is very good, and so is mine. And Prime Minister Modi is a friend of mine and he’s doing a very good job. Nothing easy, nothing easy, but he’s doing a very good job. I mean, while we’re at it, we’re talking about China and India, going at it pretty good on the border as you know. It’s been very nasty. It’s been a very nasty situation, and we stand ready to help with respect to China and India. If we can do anything, we would love to get involved and help. And we are talking to both countries about that, but I appreciate your nice sentiments. They think a lot of India, and so do I, and I think a lot of your prime minister. Thank you. I do. We had an event in Houston as you know, and it was a fantastic event. I was invited by Prime Minister Modi, and this was a massive… This was where they play football, the Houston football team. And it was incredible. It was actually incredible. And the prime minister could not have been more generous. We have great support from India. We have great support from Prime Minister Modi, and I would think that the Indian people would be voting for Trump. I also, as you know, went to India just prior to the pandemic setting in, because India has been hit very hard. Left, really, about a week before that. And we had an incredible time. What we saw… The people are so incredible. It’s really an incredible place and incredible country, and it’s definitely big. It’s definitely big. But you’ve got a great leader and he’s a great person. I hope not. I hope not, but they’re certainly going at it. They’re going at it much more strongly than a lot of people even understand. Yeah, please go ahead. No, I don’t. I don’t. I hear Germany has made it definitive, or almost definitive, but we have not seen it ourselves, no. But we have not seen it ourselves, but I would certainly be okay with that. They want to do something. They want to take action. Shouldn’t happen, but again, we are working very closely with a lot of countries and a lot of different things. We’ve taken stronger action against Russia than any other country in the world, as you know. I’ll tell you, President Putin would tell you that right now. But the fact that I get along with Russia and that I get along, frankly, with everybody right now… I’m not getting along with China, but that’s my choice. I don’t like what happened with respect to the pandemic, with respect to the China virus. I don’t like it at all. What they’ve done to this world and this country and Europe and every place else is terrible. But I do get along with President Putin, but I’ve been tougher on Russia than anybody else by far. If you look at the Obama administration, they were weak. Look at the land they gave up. Look at what happened with respect to Ukraine. Such a big part of Ukraine given up during the Obama administration, and I don’t think they would have done that with me. I don’t think they would’ve done that with me at all. We gave tank busters and they gave pillows. Do you ever hear that expression? They sent pillows and we sent tank busters to Ukraine. But with that being said, if we can do a nuclear nonproliferation agreement, that would be a great thing. No, but I would not be at all happy if that were the case. And it looks like it might very well be the case. I mean, based on what Germany is saying, that seems to be the case. John? I say what I say, and I never got along with John McCain. I disagreed with John McCain. You know that better than anybody, frankly. I wasn’t a fan. I disagreed with many of his views. I disagreed with his views on these ridiculous, endless wars. I disagreed with the way he handled the vets, the VA. The VA is running much better now, and we did with the MISSION Act and the accountability and all the things we’ve done for the VA. He was not able to do that. But I disagreed with John McCain on a lot of things. That doesn’t mean I don’t respect him. I respected him, but I really disagreed with him on a lot of things, and I think I was right. I think time has proven me right to a large extent. I do believe that, yeah. If I didn’t close up our country, if I didn’t stop China, highly infected, from coming in, if I didn’t stop Europe from coming in far sooner than anybody else, including Dr. Fauci and others wanted to… And Dr. Fauci was very nice. He said, “President Trump made a great decision.” We would have far more than that. But maybe even more importantly, if I didn’t close up, we would have, instead of the number that you mentioned or whatever it may be, at 180, we would have perhaps 1 and a half or 2 million deaths right now if I went a different direction, which some people wanted me to do, and I decided not to do it. We’d have 2 million deaths. Now, a lot of countries don’t report their deaths. Obviously, China’s not reporting because they had far more than we did. China had far more deaths than we did, in my opinion. It’s just my opinion, but they don’t report their deaths or they don’t report them accurately. And I don’t want to embarrass other countries, but I can tell you, there are other countries where the death toll is far higher than the United States, but they don’t report deaths. We report it to a level that nobody reports it. We also do testing and cases. I watch your broadcasts and read your information, your media outlet very, very carefully. And I look at the word “cases” and the reason… I say it a hundred times, nobody wants to pick it up. But we do testing at a level that nobody ever dreamed possible. We have the best tests and we have by far the most tests. Actually India, as per your question before, India is number two. And they’ve done a good job, but they’re about 40 million tests behind us. And they’re a country of 1.5 billion people. Now, because of all these tests, we have far more cases. If we cut our cases in half, if we cut our testing in half, we’d probably have about half the number of cases. If we cut it down to levels… There are some countries that don’t test. They test when somebody walks into a hospital. That’s the test you get. They walk into a hospital, they’re sick, that’s your test. We have tested more and better. And you just see where we now have millions of tests coming in from a certain company that’s done a fantastic job, and it’s going to be anywhere from 5 minutes to 15 minutes on the spot, very accurate test. But if we had much less testing, no testing, you wouldn’t be reporting cases. But you saw the… I don’t want to go over the statistics. You all wrote it down, but you see how we’re doing compared to the rest of the world. And if you took out in New York, which has been a tragic situation with the amount of people that died in New York-No, I'm just saying-I’m just saying, New York has been in particular run, whether it’s badly and competently, whether it’s unfortunate. And I appreciated Governor Cuomo saying that I’ve done a phenomenal job. And he said very good things. He said bad things too, later on when he had no real other choice. But if you took out New York from those numbers, you can multiply our tremendous success by a lot. But look, the bottom line is that the job we’ve done on COVID-19 or the China virus, China plague… Call it whatever you want, and a lot of different names, but it’s been incredible. We’ve also helped a lot of other countries, especially with ventilators, because we are now… We build ventilators at a level that nobody ever thought possible. Yeah, but you didn’t hear me. If we didn’t do what I said, we would be at 2 million deaths right now. No, they’re not taking that into account. I had a choice to make. If we made the wrong choice, the number that you have, which is less than other countries, but the other countries don’t report deaths. They don’t report them to the extent… And they’re not accurate. You know that, and so do I. You take a look at some of the things happening in certain other very large countries. First of all, we’re a very large country. But you take a look at things happening with respect to the reporting of deaths in other countries, and I say, “Give me a break.” So it’s been amazing, but we made some moves at the beginning. China, big, Europe, big. But the biggest of all was closing it down, understanding the disease and we did, and now we know it’s the elderly, it’s especially elderly. If they have heart, diabetes, if they have problems and we’re watching it and we’re watching it very closely. And by the way, we’re doing super testing with respect to that, super testing. But if we did it a different way, instead of the number that you said, but basically the number that we’re at now is approximately 180,000, we’d be at two million people right now. It could be higher than that. I don’t about the Russia vaccine. I’m not sure we have our vaccine and our vaccine is … I think it’s going to be the standard. It’s going to be great. These companies are incredible. They’ve come up with great vaccines over the years. And that’s the vaccine that probably most of the people in this room are going to want to take. It’s sitting in an account, has not been spent, but we’re willing to spend it … no, we’re willing to spend it. I’d like to get approval from Congress. There’s a theory that I don’t have to do that, but I’d rather be up front and I’d like to get approval from Congress, let it go directly to the people. It would be a great stimulus. It’s actually more stimulus than we’re asking for in terms of pure stimulus, this would be pure stimulus. I wouldn’t have to let prisoners go, some very evil prisoners go. Think of it, the Democrats in order to get what they want, and in order to give us what we … they’re talking about, allowing prisoners to be released, prisoners that we don’t want to be released. So in order that we get money to the American people, they want to say release prisoners and other things like that that are very bad. And we just can’t do that. We don’t want to do that. No, no, we have 11 people. I was just told, I was just told, we have 11 people. There is nobody that feels more strongly about our soldiers, our wounded warriors, our soldiers that died in war than I do. It’s a hoax, just like the fake dossier was a hoax. Just like the Russia, Russia, Russia was a hoax. It was a total hoax, no collusion, just like so many other things. It’s a hoax. And you’ll hear more of these things totally unrelated as we get closer and closer to election. The magazine is a failing magazine and nobody called me. Nobody called me from the magazine, said, you have a comment about it. Now they just write whatever they want to write because they figure you can’t get sued. You can get sued, but it’s a very hard bringing lawsuits. But we have many witnesses and it’s a total, it’s a total, it’s just a continuation of the witch hunt so that it can hopefully affect the election. But the American people are too smart. So whether it’s the fake dossier that turned out to be a total fraud or so many other things, so many other things have turned out. I’ve been under investigation from before I even got elected. These people have gone after me more than any president in the United States in history, in the history of the United States. And it’s a shame, it’s a shame. And despite that, we’ve done more in the first three and a half years than any administration. There has been no administration that’s done more when you add it all up. Despite all of the horrible political games that have been played, but there’s nobody that’s been able to do what I’ve done. And that includes the great Mission Act because what Obama passed was a joke. It was a joke and we took it to a level that nobody thought possible. And that includes accountability. So it’s a disgrace that somebody’s allowed to write things like that. It could have been … a lot of times the sources aren’t sources, they don’t exist. And sometimes the sources are just people that are disgruntled former so-called employees. Look, here’s the thing, I know John Kelly, he was with me, didn’t do a good job, had no temperament. And ultimately he was petered out. He was exhausted. This man was totally exhausted. He wasn’t even able to function in the last number of months. He was not able to function. He was sort of a tough guy. By the time he got eaten up in this world, it’s a different world than he was used to. He was unable to function. And I told him, “John, you’re going to have to go. Please give me a letter of resignation.” And we did that. And now he goes out and bad mouths. Now there are people that are jealous. There are people that are upset that they’re not here anymore. There are people … we’ve done an incredible job. The virus came in and now we’re doing an incredible job again. We’re going to build it up bigger than it was before the virus came in. But I don’t know that it was him, I haven’t seen that. I mean, I see anonymous, but it could have been a guy like a John Kelly, because he was [crosstalk 00:44:23] … Just so you understand, he was a very, you look at some of his news conferences what happened to him, he got eaten alive. He was unable to handle the pressure of this job. This job was a tough job. Mark Meadows doing a great job, but Kelly was unable to do that. And as far as that day, I mean, we have so much proof as to going to the … I went to Paris and the environs and I was all set to go. They had a rainstorm, the likes of which you rarely see. The fog was so great. It was as dense as I’ve ever seen. And I almost knew that you couldn’t use the helicopter. And because they had a drive through, I guess certain parts of Paris, the Secret Service, who by the way, we have people here that were on the trip, they’re writing a report, unable to even think about it. And I said, “Nope, I want to go. I insist on going.” It would have taken us forever. The Paris police said, “Please, you can’t do this.” They’d have to shut down various parts of Paris. And it just was not a possible situation. The helicopter would have been very quick. They had the helicopter all set, but the helicopter could never fly in that kind of weather. And that’s all documented by the way. We have all of the information from … and probably will release that information. But I think it’s a shame when a second rate magazine, I don’t read it, I know very little about this magazine. But when a second rate magazine can write things like that, about somebody that’s done so much for the military, can write things like that and get away with it where you actually ask questions on it. It’s a disgrace and you want to be ashamed of yourself. And let me just tell you, I watched the interview with sleepy Joe Biden, and he didn’t ask questions. You didn’t ask questions like that. Read the questions you asked, they were like meant for a child. Those questions were meant for a child. Smiles on faces of reporters, not like you and you. They were smiles on the reporters. What do you think? Take a look at those questions that they ask him. They were not meant for a grownup. They were meant for a child. So I just wanted to just tell you, I just want to tell you it’s a disgrace because you look at what I’ve done for the United States military. I love those people. I’ve gotten them pay raises when they didn’t get anything near what I’ve been able to do. And I’ve rebuilt $2.5 trillion. I’ve rebuilt the United States military. Now we’re including Space Force. Nobody’s done more for them. And then when I have to have a report read like that from a third rate magazine, that’s not going to be in business much longer. I look at that and I think it’s a disgrace. And then when I watch Biden getting asked questions that are really meant for a child to answer, anybody could answer. And I look at the level of question that you people ask. I mean, honestly, it’s disgraceful. So I want to thank you all very much. We appreciate it. And we’re doing very well. We’re very, very proud of what’s happened with respect to the economy. And I think that before the election, you’re going to see a third quarter announced. The third quarter will be at a level that our country has never seen before. Next year, we’ll go going to have a year that was better than last year. And I feel very certain. It will be better than last year. It’ll be the greatest year we’ve had. And the whole reason this is working out this way is because we set a foundation for this country like we’ve never had before. So next year is going to be a fantastic year. But remember this, the third quarter is going to be announced sometime prior to the election by a few days, actually. And I think it’s going to be record setting type numbers on GDP and other things. Thank you all very much.
















"
"52","09-07-20","We called some people, wished them a very happy Labor Day and they told us how they’re doing. And we really celebrate the American worker. We are in the midst of the fastest economic recovery in US history. So we have a lot to be thankful for including this really beautiful day. So I thought we’d do this outside as opposed to your more normal place. The United States experience the smallest contraction of any major Western nation. You probably know that you look around and see how we’re doing compared to every other nation. And our rise is spectacular and we’re rebounding much more quickly from the pandemic. The US economy added 1.4 million jobs last month. We’ve added a record setting 10.6 million jobs since May… 10.6 million jobs since May, that’s a record that is not even close as second place it’s a long ways away. In July the congressional budget office was projecting unemployment over 10.5% through the end of 2020. So they thought 2020, and maybe it would be a lot longer than that. Some projections where you go through the entire year, and that includes a lot of months in the following year, 2021. And instead the unemployment rate plunged, really to the surprise of many all the way down to 8.4% in August and that’s the second largest single month decline on record and we have the first, we have both of them. So we have the two number one declines, decline meaning positive, not negative. We’re currently witnessing the fastest labor market recovery from an economic crisis in history, world history. By contrast Biden presided over the worst, the weakest and the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression. It was a long slow slog and it was a very small … Very small in growth and very small in every other factor that you need. It was the weakest recovery. Under my leadership, next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country I project and some people are starting to agree. We have a V shape, it’s probably a super V and you see what’s going on with the stock market where it’s … In certain cases already setting records. The NASDAQ has set 17 records already and this is as we’re hopefully rounding the final turn in the pandemic. First we’ll end the pandemic under Operation Warp Speed. We’ve pioneered groundbreaking therapies reducing the fatality rate. 85% since April. You don’t hear that from the press very often. They don’t like to talk about that. So the fatality rate, 85%. Think of that since April. The United States has experienced among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country in the world and we are an absolute leader in every way. Under my leadership we’ll produce a vaccine in record time. Biden and his very liberal running mate, the most liberal person in Congress by the way, is not a competent person in my opinion would destroy this country and would destroy this economy. Should immediately apologize for the reckless anti-vaccine rhetoric that they are talking right now, talking about endangering lives and it undermines science and what’s happening is all of a sudden you’ll have this incredible vaccine and because of that fake rhetoric, it’s political rhetoric, that’s all it is, just for politics because now they see we’ve done an incredible job and in speed like nobody’s ever seen before, this could have taken two or three years and instead it’s going to be done in a very short period of time. Could even happen during the month of October. So contrary to all of the lies, the vaccine … They’re political lies, they’ll say anything and it’s so dangerous for our country what they say but the vaccine will be very safe and very effective and it will be delivered very soon. Now you could have a very big surprise coming up. I’m sure you’ll be very happy but the people will be happy, the people of the world will be happy. Next we’ll return to unprecedented prosperity through our pro-American policies. We’ll pass new tax cuts to boost take home pay, we’re going to be cutting taxes very substantially, we get it back through growth. We had tremendous growth until we got hit with the China virus. We’ll continue our historic regulatory reduction campaign. As you know in three and a half years we’ve cut more regulations than any other administration, no matter how long, what period of time you’re talking about. We’ll enact fair trade deals and we’re working on seven major fair trade deals right now and when I say fair, fair to our country because our country was ripped off by every nation, friend, foe, didn’t matter. Every nation was ripping us off at a level that it’s just unbelievable to be honest. We’re going to be expanding opportunity zones and we will keep that going, it’s been a tremendous program. I want to thank Senator Scott in South Carolina for coming up with that whole concept because he came up and I liked it right away, it’s really turned out to be a tremendous thing, especially for African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans. We’ll continue to unleash American energy, we’re number one in the world and we’re totally energy independent right now and in 2021 we’ll create 10 million jobs at least in the first 10 months. Joe Biden and the radical socialist Democrats would immediately collapse the economy. If they got in they would collapse it. You’ll have a crash the likes of which you’ve never seen before. Your stocks, your 401(k)s. Remember, it’s the people that own these massive listed companies. A lot of people, rich people, not so rich people, middle income people and those stocks will crash like you’ve never seen before. The Biden plan begins with a four trillion dollar tax hike and that will end everything including growth. It won’t be growth it will be total contraction. Biden’s also pledged to demolish the U.S. energy industry and implement the same policies causing blackouts in California. He wants to have things lit up with wind. He’ll have to talk to China, Russia, India, lots of other countries because they’re not doing that and if they’re not doing it, puts us at a tremendous economic disadvantage and it doesn’t work. You take a look at the blackouts in California, it’s really rather amazing what’s going on [inaudible 00:05:54] they’ve tried to go and that’s just with a small portion going that route. That doesn’t work and it can’t fire up our big plants. We’re going to have this great industry that we’ve created. Can’t fire up our big plants. Biden’s plan for the China virus is to shut down the entire U.S. economy. He’s going to totally rely on somebody to walk up, “Yes sir, it’s time to shut it down.” He’d be laying off tens of millions of workers and causing countless deaths from suicide, substance abuse, depression, heart disease and other very serious illnesses. Because when you do a shutdown, there’s a problem on the other side. It’s not just from the virus, you have a big problem with suicides, with losing your jobs, with all sorts of things that you just take a look. Depression is a massive problem and what happens is they turn to substance abuse, alcohol, drugs. So we can’t do that and then we’d have to give up all the gains that I’ve been talking about over the last three months. What we have done is incredible. We’re setting records all over the world no matter where you go. Nobody has done what we’ve been able to do. So we’re setting records in jobs, we’re setting records in numbers, and you’re going to see some very big numbers. Third quarter numbers are coming out right before a very special day, November 3. So you have the numbers coming out and they’re I think going to be fantastic. I think they’re going to be fantastic. The best numbers of all if somebody doesn’t come along and raise taxes, double, triple, quadruple your taxes will be the numbers from next year but you’re going to have a good third quarter number coming out and I think it’s going to be hard for even the media to disparage that number. Biden wants to surrender our country to the virus. He wants to surrender our families to the violent left wing mob and he wants to surrender our jobs to China. Jobs and our economic well-being. I’ve taken in billions and billions of dollars from China, no other president’s done what I’ve done. I’ve given much of it to the farmers, I’ve given it to farmers, manufacturers, but I’ve given most of it to the U.S. Treasury. Nobody’s done that, we haven’t taken in $0.10 from China ever. They targeted our farmers and I targeted them and I gave $28 billion to our farmers. Our farmers wouldn’t be existent right now. Right now they’re very happy. In fact they’re setting records on purchases. China is purchasing more corn than they’ve ever done, record purchase of corn and soybeans, beef because they know I’m not happy with them. They know I’m not happy at all and frankly I don’t want to set the world necessarily to thinking too much about it right now but there’s been no country anywhere at any time that’s ripped us off like China has. We lose billions and billions of dollars, for years and years, decades. We’ve lost billions and billions and billions of dollars by dealing with China. We get nothing from China. They give nothing other than getting our money and they take that money and they build their military and you see they’re building up a powerful military and it’s very lucky that I’ve been building ours up because otherwise we’d be dwarfed right now by China. we would be a terrible thing. A terrible thing. We’re way ahead on the nuclear front. We’ve upgraded our nuclear, hope to God we’d never have to use it but we would be in a position that we are not in right now with China spending the money we give them to build up their military. So when you mention the word decouple, it’s an interesting word. So we lose billions of dollars and if we didn’t do business with them we wouldn’t lose billions of dollars. It’s called decoupling see, you’ll start thinking about it. You’ll start thinking. They take our money and they spend it on building airplanes and building ships and building rockets and missiles and Biden has been just a pawn for them. He’s been so easy they dream about Biden. There was a report today that they hope that Joe Biden becomes president. If Joe Biden becomes president China will own the United States and every other country will be smiling also. They’ll be smiling. When reports come out that certain countries don’t really like me too much, that’s not because of my personality although it could be that also frankly. It’s because of the fact that I’ve been very tough on countries that have been ripping us off for so many years. If you look at NATO, with the exception of eight countries, we’re one of them, every country is way behind, they’re delinquent, especially Germany, in paying their NATO bills. That means we end up paying it and we’re not doing it. I told them, we’re not doing it, and they’ve increased their spending now $130 billion going up to $400 billion a year. It’s all because of me. Then you hear the country doesn’t like me, I mean I can understand that. Because President Obama and other presidents in all fairness, we’d go in there and they’d make a speech and they’d leave, I went in there, I looked and I said, ” This is unfair. We’re paying for NATO. We’re paying for NATO. Almost all of it.” So they rip us off on the military and then they rip us off with the European Union on trade. Biden doesn’t have a clue. You know he doesn’t have a clue. Everybody knows he doesn’t have a clue. In primetime he wasn’t good and now it’s not primetime. He’s spent 47 years sending American jobs to China, to Mexico and to other countries while collecting millions of dollars in campaign and super PAC contributions from global corporations that got rich by making American workers poor. His son Where’s Hunter, Where’s Hunter? I call him Where’s Hunter walked away with one and a half billion dollars to manage even though he never did that before. He walked away with a fortune from Ukraine, from China and from other countries. Between his son and his brother, you ought to read the statements and the press doesn’t pick that up. If I ever did that, it would be hell even worse than it’s been, even worse than it’s been. What he’s done is so incredible. “I won’t give them the billion dollars,” he says. “I won’t give them unless they get rid of that prosecutor.” Then woola, they got rid of the prosecutor and the press doesn’t even want to talk about it. You talk about quid pro quo. With me, there was none. With him, he’s right on tape and you don’t want to cover it. You should be ashamed of yourselves. The press should be ashamed of themselves. With Biden, shipped away our jobs, threw open our borders and sent our youth to fight in these crazy, endless wars. I’m not saying the military is in love with me, the soldiers are. The top people in the Pentagon probably aren’t because they want to do nothing but fight wars so that all of those wonderful companies that make the bombs and make the planes and make everything else, stay happy. But we’re getting out of the endless wars, you know how we’re doing. We defeated 100% of the ISIS caliphate, 100%. When I came in, it was a mess. They have it in a certain color, all ISIS. A year later, I said, “Where is it?” “It’s all gone, sir. Because of you, it’s all gone,” because of my philosophy, but all gone. I said, “That’s good. Let’s bring our soldiers back home.” Some people don’t like to come home. Some people like to continue to spend money. One cold-hearted globalist betrayal after another and that’s what it was. Biden supported NAFTA. He supported China’s entry into the World Trade Organization, two disasters, the most disastrous trade deals in history. Both of them. I can’t tell you which was worse. They were both terrible. As you know, I ended it and I ended NAFTA and we’re looking at the World Trade Organization. They think I’m much better. I will say that. We were tough and world got out of it because we’re spending $500 million. China was spending $38 million and Chine controlled it. But World Trade, we’re looking at it. They’ve been very nice to us lately. I will say that. Amazing. We never used to win anything at the World Trade. We’d lose every case. Now, all of a sudden we’re winning a lot of cases. We just won $7 billion as a case and they’re talking to us much differently than they used to because if they don’t shape up, we’re going to ship out, that’s all, if we’re not treated fairly. China is treated as a developing nation, developing nation. We’re treated as a nation that’s fully developed. We’re not fully developed as far as I’m concerned. When you look around at Portland and you see what these Democrats are doing to our cities, take a look at what’s happening in New York and Chicago. We have Democrat-run cities, mayors that are running and governors that are running states so badly and mayors running city so badly. It’s very sad to look at it. It’s Democrat-run, every one of them that I see. I guess we could probably find one or two that aren’t, but so far, I haven’t been able to. If you look at Biden, he supported TPP, Tran-Pacific Partnership, which would have been a disaster. It would have destroyed our automobile business. By the way, many plants are being built right now, auto plants in Michigan, just like I said. They’re big built in Ohio. They’re being built in South Carolina, North Carolina. They’re being built all over and expanded at a level that we’ve never seen before, because I said to Japan, Germany and others, “Sorry, you got to come here and build plants. Otherwise, we’re going to have to make it very tough on you with tariffs. We got out of the horrible Paris Climate Accord that he’ll go back into it because it sounds wonderful. It’s a disaster for this country. They’ve basically taken away your wealth, the Paris Climate Accord, and the other countries don’t have to adhere to it. China doesn’t kick in until 2030. They’re not going to do anything until 2030. We had very high standards. We went out and closed other some scenarios, 25% of our businesses in order to qualify under this ridiculous Paris Climate Accord. It sounds good. It was very bad and very expensive. The New York Times has just published an entire story on Biden’s China sellout, which is amazing for the New York Times. I appreciate that. In 2001, Biden said, “The United States welcomes the emergence of a prosperous, integrated China at the global stage, because we expect this is going to be a China that plays by the rules.” They didn’t play by the rules. They didn’t play the rules. The World Trade Organization, one of the reasons it’s so bad is that China didn’t lay by the rules. We did. We did, but their rules were easier because they’re considered a developing nation. So they had a much lower standard, but even that they didn’t play by the rules. That’s when they became a rocket ship. They were flat in line for years and years and years, then they joined the World Trade Organization and frankly, they cheated. They cheated. I’ll say it. What difference does it make? I made a great trade deal with China, great, and they’re buying. You know why they’re buying because they know I’m not happy. That’s why they’re buying. I talk about it because today is Labor Day. It’s a good time to talk about when we’re being ripped off by countries, but nobody’s even close to China. Biden cheered China’s rise at great power because great powers adhere to international norms in the areas of non-proliferation, human rights and trade. Well, they didn’t. They took advantage of stupid people, stupid people and Biden’s a stupid person. You know that. You’re not going to write it, but you know that. The cost of Biden’s economic treachery was 60,000 shuttered American factories and I hear this morning, that the real number is probably 70,000. Seventy thousand shuttered American factories and he’s talking about how wonderful it is with China. Now, China has been very bad on top of which we had the China plague sent to us and other viruses, nothing near this serious, but this one. We had other viruses sent in over the years that came from China. I wonder why. If Biden wins, china wins because China will own this country, if Biden wins, China will own this country and hopefully you’re not going to be able to find that out. It’s the most important election in our history right now, most important election in our history. Under my administration, we will make America into the manufacturing super power of the world and we’ll end our reliance on China, once and for all, whether it’s decoupling or putting in massive tariffs like I’ve been doing already. I’m going to end our reliance on China because we can’t rely on China. I don’t want them building a military like they’re building right now. They’re using our money to build it. We’ll manufacture our critical medical supplies in the United States. We’ll create made in America tax credits and bring our jobs back from China to the United States and we’ll impose tariffs on companies that desert America to create jobs in China and other countries. If they can’t do it here, they let them pay a big tax to build it someplace else and send it into our country. We’ll prohibit federal contracts from companies that outsource to China and we’ll hold China accountable for allowing the virus to spread around the world. Now you can understand why China would much rather see sleepy Joe than Donald Trump, but as long as I’m president, we will never waiver in our undying loyalty to the American worker and to our country as a whole. So happy Labor Day, everybody. Go ahead. You’re going to have to take that off, please. You can take it off. How many feet are you away? Well, if you don’t take it off, you’re very muffled. So if you would take it off, it would be a lot easier-It's better. Yeah. It's better. No, I don't understand it. No, I don’t understand it at all because I’ve always been on the opposite side of John McCain. John McCain liked wars. I will be a better warrior than anybody, but will we fight a war we’re going to win them? Frankly, I was never a fan of John McCain. You know that. It’s been very obvious, but I had to approve his entire, his funeral I wanted him to get. He deserved a first class … you know that all was approved by me. We sent Air Force One to pick up the casket, a lot of things. But no, I was not a fan of John McCain because he wanted the endless wars and I didn’t. I thought that the way the vets were taking care of, our great vets, was not good, not appropriate. Of course he took the fake dirty dust and gave and gave it over to the FBI. So if this is not somebody, am I supposed to say, “What a wonderful guy?” So, you know what? I lived with him. He lived with me, but we had different philosophies. I think my philosophy is right. I think it’s turned out to be right, but I wasn’t a fan, but I respect people. I respect a lot of people, that doesn’t mean I necessarily have to agree with them and I didn’t agree with him on a lot of things. The story is a hoax written by a guy who’s got a tremendously bad history. The magazine itself, which I don’t read, but I hear it just totally anti-Trump. He’s a big Obama person. He’s a big Clinton person and he made up the story. It’s a totally made up story. In fact, I was very happy to see Zach Fuentes came out and said, “Now, I think that’s number 15,” and these are the people who were there. That’s the 15th person, General Kellogg, everybody that was there knew what happened, so I was happy to see that Zach came out and said it’s not true. It just came out and it’s a disgrace. Who would say a thing like that? Only an animal would say a thing like that. There is nobody that has more respect for, not only our military, but for people that gave their lives in the military. I think John Kelly knows that, I think he would know that. I think he knows that from me, but Zach Fuentes who does work for John, I think they both know that. But Zach came out, as you know, today or yesterday, last night and said very strongly that he didn’t hear anything like that. Even John Bolton came out and said that was untrue. Now what was true is that we had the worst weather. I think it was his bad a rain as I’ve just about ever seen and it was a fog. You literally couldn’t see. I walked out. I didn’t need somebody to tell me. I walked out. I said, “There’s no way we can take helicopters in this.” I understand helicopters very well. They said, “No, sir. That’s been canceled.” Secret Service, I have the whole list, they would’ve had to go through a very, very busy section during the day of Paris. They would have had to go through the city. The Paris police were asking us, “Please don’t do it,” because they’re not ready. When you do that, you need a lot of time. That take days and days and days to prepare for that. I wanted to do it very badly. I was willing to sit in the car for two hours, three hours, four hours, I didn’t care. It didn’t matter. I had nothing else to do. I went there for that. I had nothing else to do. It was ended because of the terrible weather and nobody was prepared to go through in terms of Paris, the police, the military, and the secret service, and they came out very strongly and said, “Sir, we can’t allow you to make this trip.” If I wanted to, “Sir, we can’t allow you from a safety standpoint.” It was a phony story just like the dirty dossier, the fake dirty dossier. Just like the Russia collusion, just like all of the other phony stories. And there’ll be more phony stories. But I do appreciate Zack coming out, but Zack now is the fifteenth person that’s denied it. Zack now I think also talked about the weather aspect of it, and he’s probably the fourteenth or fifteenth person that blamed it on weather, so that’s enough of that. Yes please. Thank you. We're talking about where nonlethal force? The riots? Well I think what’s happened is the toughness. These are Democrat run cities all, and there’s no retribution. There’s no … They stand there. They throw things at the people that are supposed to be protecting something, and nothing happens. They throw rocks, they throw cans of soup, they throw lots of hard objects. And rarely does anything happen. But I’ve told when we have the federal in there, as you know I told the U.S. Marshalls to go get the man who killed another man, and they know who it was, and you have to arrest him. You have to arrest him. After two and a half days they didn’t arrest him. The U.S. Marshalls went in, and it ended up being a gunfight, and then man was killed. But this is a man that had a bad record, and this is a man that killed a man in the street. I witnessed it. Most people witnessed it. And the U.S. Marshalls went in. They weren’t playing games. They can’t play games. If somebody is breaking the law there’s got to be a form of retribution. I watch so often, when I watch some of the areas that we’re talking about … Now we have Rochester. That’s again, Democrat governor, Democrat mayor, all Democrats every one of them, and it always will be. I was with the governor of Texas. He looked at me and said, “I can’t imagine how they allow this to happen.” And it’s different, it’s different. I could talk about other governors saying the same thing. Yeah, please, go ahead. So we have now over 1,000 people, federal, in jail. We’re prosecuting many people. A big thing was when I signed the law putting people in jail if you knock down monuments. That was three months ago. There hasn’t been a federal monument knocked down in three months or even thought about. I don’t think they’ve even thought about it, so that’s had a very big impact, very big impact. But, yeah, we’re going around. And the nice part is you people take … See those people up there. They take nice pictures of everybody, so we don’t even have to bother. We can use the news photos. We had a photo right over there of Andrew Jackson the monument. He was getting ready, and this guy was a big, brave guy, and he was up like this, and he was showing off to all his friends. He got arrested, so did a lot of other people get arrested. And I would say we have the ultimate proof. Now, in that case we got there before they ripped down the statue of Andrew Jackson, which is so beautiful, which is right over there. But they never got it. But right after that I signed an order saying you go to prison for 10 years. And as soon as I signed that order that was the end of the statues coming down. But they have other ideas. They’ve got plenty of ideas. They’re not at want for ideas. Please, go ahead. Don’t say there’s no hope. Why do you say there’s no hope? What do you know? What do you know? Let me just tell you, I know my customers. That’s what I do. I know Pelosi. I know Schumer very well. They don’t want to make a deal because they think it’s good for politics if they don’t make a deal. This has nothing to do with anything other than you have to know who you’re dealing with. I do. These are people that I don’t have a lot of respect. I don’t think they have a lot of respect for the American people, and I know who I’m dealing with. I don’t need to meet with them to be turned down. They don’t want to make a deal because they know that’s good for the economy. And if they make a deal that’s good for the economy, and therefore it’s good for me for the election in November, November 3rd, and therefore they’re not going to make a deal. Now, if we gave the store away, if we bailed out all of their Democrat run cities where we give them a trillion dollars, which is the kind of money they want. They want a trillion dollars to bail out badly run Democrat cities and states whether it’s New York or Illinois or others, they want to bail them out. And we’re saying, “We’re not going to pay that kind of a price in order to bail the … We’ll do something to help cities, but that’s going to have to rest on its own. And why didn’t you do this at the beginning?” Because they could’ve done it in the beginning. So I know who I’m dealing with. I’m on the phone with Mnuchin and with Meadows and with all of these people constantly, but while they’re there. But I also know when it’s time to meet with people. I’ve done very well with deals. Okay, that’s what I do. And I know when it’s time to meet. But I don’t have to meet them in order to be turned down and in order for them to walk out to the sticks, which is the microphones, and give you people a false report of what just took place in the Oval Office. They don’t want to make a deal because they think that if the country does as badly as possible even though a lot of people are being hurt that’s good for the Democrats, but David, that’s a bad thing. Yeah, please go ahead. I am taking the high road. I’m taking the high road by not seeing them. That’s the high road. Yeah. And if I thought it made a difference or would make a difference I’d do it in a minute. Yeah, go ahead. Yeah, sure. They spied on my campaign, that's right. They spied on my campaign, and if they were Democrats they would’ve been in jail two years ago. They would’ve been in jail literally. If this side were the Democrat side they would’ve been in jail two years ago for 50-year terms for treason and other things. I’m not going to say that. I have to see the report. I haven’t seen it. I purposefully … I don’t know if that was a good thing, smart thing, I don’t know. But nobody can complain about it. I have every right to have been very much involved. And maybe someday I’ll get involved in it. They spied on my campaign, and that includes Biden and Obama. They spied on my campaign, tried to defeat me. They wrote up a fake dossier that has proven to be totally fake, written by Christopher Steele, paid for by Hillary Clinton and the Democrats. And they use that illegally in the FISA codes. If we did what they did you would have many people in jail right now, and you have other than the one agent that admitted his guilt, that he forged documents, we don’t have that yet, but the report hasn’t been issued yet. Let’s see what happens, but let me just say something. President Obama and Biden, Sleepy Joe, he knew everything that was happening. They were spying on my campaign, and they got caught. Now let’s see what happens. But if this were the opposite way people would’ve been jailed. They would’ve been in jail already for a period of at least, it would’ve started two years ago, and it would’ve been for 50 years for treason because you can’t do that. Nothing like that’s ever happened before. Then they created, at tremendous expense … The money they paid is tremendous. I’m sure you know the money that was paid, millions of dollars. They created a fake dossier, a fake dossier, proven to be now fake, everyone, and they used it in the FISA codes. That’s a crime. So far I haven’t seen anybody have a problem, but the report hasn’t been issued yet. Let’s see what happens with the Durham report. But this started at Obama, and some people would say, and some people go, “Well, but he was the president,” like, “Let’s leave him alone.” If it were me they wouldn’t be leaving me alone, I can tell you. It’s a totally double standard, and it’s a disgrace. And if I were a Republican senator, and if were a Republican congressman, and we have some great ones, but we have a lot of them that don’t fight the way that the other side fights. We have much better policy. We have much better things going for us like borders and walls and immigration and no sanctuary cities. They have a lot of bad stuff going, but they’re dirty fighters, and the dirtiest fight of all is the issuance of 80 million ballots unrequested. They’re not requested. They’re just sending 80 million ballots all over the country, 80 million ballots, non requested. I call them unsolicited ballots. That’s going to be the dirtiest fight of all. People are going to get ballots. They’re going to say, “What am I doing?” And then they’re going to harvest, they’re going to do all the things. And if you look at the last period of six months, take a look at the races where they’ve sent ballots out. Take a look at Carolyn Maloney whose race should be redone because she won that race totally unfairly to her opponent. Her opponent did very well against her. That race should be rerun, but they declared her the winner because they heard I found out about it. But take a look at what’s happened in New Jersey and in Virginia and different places. It’s a disgrace. That’ll be a beauty. Yeah, please. I don’t know too much about it. I read something this morning, but other than that I’d have to see it. He’s a very respected man. He was approved very much by both parties I guess. It was an approval that took place by both parties. I don’t know exactly what the story is. I’ll certainly know within a short period of time. I just read it for the first time. I read it this morning just like you did. Sure, sure. Let the investigations go, but he’s a very respected man. Again, it was a bipartisan commission. Postmaster general is appointed by a bipartisan commission. And we’ll see how that goes, but I think he’s a very honest guy, but we’ll see. Yeah. Yeah, if something can be proven that he did something wrong always. Always. They’ve been looking at me for four years. They found nothing. Four years, think of it, for four years, from the day I came down the escalator I’ve been under investigation by sleaze, and they found nothing. They found nothing. A friend of mine said, “You have to be the most innocent, honorable man ever to hold the office of president.” Think of it, they spent, just Mueller alone he spent …I guess the real number turned out to be $48 million, but whatever it was many, many millions of dollars. They had 18 angry Democrats looking, they had FBI agents all over the place, and they’d have no collusion. Friends of mine have said… Sophisticated friends have said, “You’ve got to be the most innocent guy ever to hold this office.” And there’s a lot of truth to that. Yeah, please. Sure. Sure. Well, I’ve been supportive of that. I was the first one that brought it up, you’d never heard of Nord Stream 2 until Trump came along. When I came along, I said, “Wait a minute, we’re protecting Germany from Russia, right? NATO. We’re protecting Germany from Russia. Germany’s paying Russia billions and billions of dollars to get their energy, and the real number is probably 60 to 70%. Ultimately of their energy is going to come from Russia, and I said this for years and nobody talks about it. One of the many things between sanctions and all of what we’ve done for Ukraine relative to what the past had. They used to send pillows, and we sent tank busters. But I brought that up a long time ago, Russia is unhappy that I brought it up, but you never heard of North Stream 2, nobody did until I got elected. And I said, “Why is Germany making a deal to give billions of dollars to Russia? And then we’re protecting Germany from Russia. How does that work?” Then on top of it, Germany is delinquent because they’re only paying a little more than 1% and they’re supposed to be paying 2%, and even the 2% is low, but just remember Trump me, I got the countries of NATO to spend 130 billion going to $400 billion a year. Think of it, $400 billion a year more for NATO. The purpose of data primarily is your protection against Russia. Now they can use it for other, I guess, and they have a little bit in the Middle East, et cetera, et cetera. But I’m the one that did that, but nobody talks about that. Nobody talks about North Stream 2 the answer is absolutely, if they feel that something happens. But I don’t know that Germany is in a position right now, because Germany is in a very weakened position energy wise, they’re closing all their plants, they’re closing their nuclear, they’re closing their coal, they’re closing a lot of plants. They have put themselves in a very bad position, frankly. Very, very bad position. Yeah, please. No, I have nothing against John. I have nothing against anybody, no. I was very heartened to see that a friend of his, because I know Zach is a friend of his and worked for him. I was very heartened to see that Zach [Forenz 00:39:12] just came out with the statement that he did I guess late last night that it was not true. Well, we’re going to do a report. Yeah. I find those people… They’re all gone. It was a disgrace, frankly. We’re going to give you a big report, that’s going to make you very happy. All right, yeah please. Okay. No, they say worst. They say negative. They say negative. They’re going to make the vaccine into a negative, so then when do we have it. And I spoke to the head of Pfizer, I spoke to the head of Johnson & Johnson, I spoke to the heads of greatest medical companies in the world, we’re doing great, we’ll have it soon. Wait a minute, so now what they’re saying is, “Oh wow, this is bad news. President Trump is getting this vaccine in record time.” By the way, if this were the Obama administration, you wouldn’t have that vaccine for three years, you probably wouldn’t have it at all. So we’re going to have a vaccine very soon. Maybe even before a very special day, you know what date I’m talking about? Let me just tell you wait. What they’re doing because they think it is going fast, and if you talked to a lot of your sources, if you have sources. If you talk to your sources in the FDA, you’ll see it’s going very, very well. The numbers are looking unbelievably strong, unbelievably good. So now they’re saying, “Wow, Trump’s pulled this off. Okay, let’s disparage the vaccine.” That’s so bad for this country, that’s so bad for the world to even say that, and that’s why they’re saying it, but I watched Kamala’s whole numbers drop from 15 to almost zero and then drop out even before she ran in Iowa because people didn’t like her, and I understand why. She will never be president, although I have to be careful because Obama used to say that about me so I have to be a little bit careful. But you have to look at her a little bit more closely because obviously Joe’s not doing too well. So you’re going to have to look at her a little bit too closely, but she’s talking about disparaging a vaccine so that people don’t think the achievement was a great achievement. I don’t want the achievement for myself, I want something that’s going to make people better that people aren’t going to get sick with that includes therapeutics, where we’re doing equally as well. Therapeutics, go ahead. Yes. No, I didn’t say they were. [crosstalk 00:41:54] by the end of the year. No, but you’re not quoting me accurately. I said that vaccines will be on the market before the end of the year, but they may even be on the market, they may even be developed and fully developed, tested, everything else. We have 30,000 people in just one vaccine right now under test in very, very highly infected areas, so we’re going to be able to get a good result one way or the other very soon. So I didn’t say what you said, what I said is by the end of the year, but I think it could even be sooner than that. It could be during the month of October actually, it could be before November. No, I’m saying that because we want to save a lot of lives. With me, it’s the faster the better. If somebody else made me they would say it politically, but I’m saying it in terms of this is what we need, we have to have, if we get the vaccine early that’s a great thing, whether it’s politics or not. Now do benefits in Newark, if you’re able to get something years ahead of schedule, I guess maybe they do. But the most important thing to me is saving lives, that’s the most important thing. Yeah, go ahead. You sound so clear as opposed to everybody else where they refuse. Yeah, so I want everybody to know everything they can about our history. I’m not a believer in cancel culture, the good and the bad. You don’t study the bad, it could happen again. So I do want that subject studied very, very carefully, and very accurately. But we grew up with a certain history and now they’re trying to change our history, revisionist history. That’s why they want to take down our monuments, that’s why they want to take down our statues. I saw something the other day, which was absolutely horrendous, a Washington monument they want to rename it, the DC committee, but the DC committee is all Democrats, Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson. I mean, we’re talking about… This is the big stuff now, this is the big stuff. And they want to rename it, they want to re-designate it, they want to take some down. Now we don’t do that, never going to happen with me I guarantee you that. Well, I want to thank you all and I just want to wish you a very Happy Labor Day and we’re having tremendous success whether it’s on the vaccines, whether it’s on the pandemic, the plague that came in from China, that China should have never let happen because I will never feel the same about China. And I just want to again, wish you a Happy Labor Day. Thank you very much.
















"
"53","09-08-20","Well, thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. It’s a great honor to be in North Carolina. We had great, great luck and great people backing us in North Carolina. And I’m thrilled to be in Winston Salem with thousands of loyal, hard working American Patriots. You are great people. Great people. I don’t know how many people here, but there’s a lot. We said let’s keep it down. They didn’t do too good a job, but that’s good. That’s good. Now these crowds, I tell you it’s beyond what we had in terms of enthusiasm, beyond what we had four years ago in 2016, and that was a record enthusiasm and we are breaking that record by a lot. This is the most important election we’ve ever had. 56 days from now, we’re going to win North Carolina. We’re going to win four more years in the White House. This is a choice. And I must say, this is a choice for many, many decades. I don’t think you has a bigger difference and maybe you’ve never had a bigger difference. This is the American dream and the other, I don’t want to say it because I’ll get myself in trouble with the fake news back there. But the other is a basic disaster for our country. Joe Biden devoted his career to offshoring your jobs, throwing open your borders, dragging us into endless foreign wars, along with some of his other friends and surrendering our children’s future to countries like China. Remember this, very simple to remember. If Biden wins, China wins. It’s as simple as that. So you have a situation where we built the greatest economy in the history of the world. We were forced to close it because of the China plague that came in and now we’ve opened it. And by the way, your state should be open. Your state should be open. Any governor that does that. And even if you look statistically, it’s you it’s Michigan, it’s a couple of others. They’re closed. New York. Look what they’re doing in New York, what they’re doing to our beautiful New York. It’s so sad. But you just take a look at what’s going on in North Carolina. They want to open. They want to open. They want to open in Michigan so badly. They want to open. They want to have football. They want to have their schools open. And it’s a shame what’s going on. And I’ll tell you what, on November 4th, every one of those states will be open. They’re doing it for political reasons. They’re doing it for political reasons. They think by hurting the economy, by keeping all these store owners and all these people that work in shops and stores and buildings, offices, they think by keeping them and hurting them, you’re hurting the economy. Our economy is doing phenomenally well. And it’s not only is it a V, it’s a super V. You see what’s happened. We just had a jobs number come out, 1.4 million. It’s down to 8.4%. Nobody thought that, 8.4. So we had the greatest economy, we closed it up and now we’re opening it up and your state should go with it. We’re opening it up. And we will have a great third quarter. It’s going to be announced, by the way, just before the election, but we’re going to have a great third quarter. We have unbelievable retail numbers, unbelievable numbers all over. And this is that super V. But next year is going to be one of the greatest years in the history of a country economically, unless the wrong person gets in and quadruples everybody’s taxes in which case you will see a depression the likes of which you haven’t seen. And remember this, if Biden wins the violent mobs, you see these mobs all over the place. They’re Biden people. They’re Biden states and cities. They’re Democrat states. If they win, the mobs win. You see these guys, they go around saying, yeah, I want your meal. Give me that food. Give me that. A woman sitting there, she wants to eat. And they come and they grab her food. They grab her drink. Nobody’s ever seen stuff like this. This is all that ideology. We’re not going to let it happen. We’re not going to let it happen. And in Portland, you see what happened last night, they arrested over 50 people the first time. We said, either do it or what going in. We’re going to have to go in, do it. Let us go in. We’re saying I spoke to the governor of Oregon the other day. Let us go in. I said, let us go in. We’ll straighten it out in less than a half an hour. Now the US Marshals did go in to take care of that one guy who killed somebody. You saw that. He killed a young man in the middle of the street violently. He had other charges against him. And I put out, when is he going to be arrested? And they went in about 15 minutes later. And I’ll tell you what our federal government is so ready to go. All they have to do is call us. It’ll all be solved very quickly. They have to call them. But all of these places are Democrat run places, radical left run places. They don’t know what the hell they’re doing. If Biden wins, the rioters, arsonists and anarchists win. He said the other day, well, if I win, that doesn’t mean that’s going to stop. He doesn’t, he will never stop. If they win, it’s not going to happen, hopefully. Because this is not like a second place crowd. Let’s face it. Are you seeing? Are you seeing all the polls numbers are coming out? That’s why he left. Finally, he left his basement. He said we got problems. I don’t think he knows that, but the people that manage him know it. They understand it. He doesn’t. So I’m running for reelection to keep jobs at home, to put violent criminals behind bars and to ensure the future belongs to America, not to China and other countries. Because if we win, America wins. You know that. You’ve seen that. Over the last three and a half years, we’ve secured America’s borders, fixed our broken trade deals, and they were broken like you’ve never seen. They weren’t even broken. They were bad. They were bad from day one. Rebuilt the awesome power of the United States military, obliterated the ISIS caliphate 100%. In fact, I got it down to 98%. Remember a year and a half ago, I got it down to 98. And they all said, no, no, it’s got to be a 100. I said, somebody else could finish. We want to get home. They said, no, you’ve got to finish it, so we took another two months, we finished it and we’re bringing them home. We’re bringing them home. These great, great warriors. People don’t like it when I say that. Secured American energy independence and built the greatest economy in the history of the world. And now we are very simply, we’re doing it again and we’re on track to have, as I said, the best year we’ve ever had next year. You just had the best year. You just had the best year of the history of your state last year. We’ve created a record breaking 10.6 million jobs in the last four months. Next year will be the single greatest economic year in the history of our country and probably in the history of your state, if your governor ever opens up. But hopefully you’re going to have Dan Forrest. You’re not going to have [inaudible 00:09:31]. But if sleepy Joe Biden takes power, the economy will collapse. He won’t even know the difference. How’s the economy? Not good, sir. We’re in a depression. We are? What’s that? Joe Biden, who spent 47 years shipping North Carolina jobs to China and other countries, you know that. And I’ve spent the last four years bringing jobs back to our country. We’ve never had so many jobs. We’re up to 160 million jobs. We were never anywhere close. We got up to 160 million and we were never anywhere close to that. Here in North Carolina, voting is already underway. On November 3rd, Americans will decide whether we will quickly return to record prosperity or whether we allow the same left wing extremists that have no idea what they’re doing to burn down buildings or take control of government, set fire to a whole country. You know, when they started knocking down the monuments and statues a few months ago, I signed a very strong executive order. You want to knock them down? That’s fine. But you go to jail for 10 years. It was amazing. It was amazing how that stopped. And then they said, well, we’ll do it easily. We’ll do it through the process because they don’t want to spend 10 years. You know, they’d look at it. They’d say not worth it. 10 years is too much. But the DC committee, did you see about that? They want to change the name of the Washington Monument. They want to get rid of the Lincoln Monument, Jefferson Monument. Now, we’re talking the big stuff. They finally hit the big time, took them awhile to get there. But I said that was going to happen. Don’t worry about it. You don’t have a thing to worry about. If our foreign adversaries were devising a scheme to cripple America, they could hardly do better than the Biden, Kamala Harris, Kamala. Remember Kamala? She started at 15. She was supposed to win. Problem was she went from 15 to 14 to 12 to 10 to seven to four. It’s like a free fall. You know what, people don’t like her. Nobody likes her. She could never be the first woman president. She could never be. That would be an insult to our country. Biden wants to impose a $4 trillion tax hike, a ban on American energy, eliminate America’s borders, confiscate your guns. He wants to get rid of your second amendment. We’re going to be appointing very pro crime judges, but they want to destroy your suburbs. You know, the rule, the regulation that I just terminated. They want to build low income projects in the suburbs. They’ve been doing it. They’ve been destroying suburbs. We’re not doing it anymore. Somebody said suburban women, how’s Trump doing? But do you remember last time too? They said women don’t like Trump. I said, I think they do. I think they do. They said women don’t, and then we did great with women. And remember that great. Was that one of the greatest evenings ever? Four years ago. That was one of the greatest. But one of the things they did, first of all, we did much better. Now we’re doing really well. African American vote, much better Hispanic vote, much better. He did better with African Americans than we thought. He did better with Hispanic than we thought. He did better with Asians than we thought. He did really well with women. What’s this all about? Ladies and gentlemen. And they said, Donald Trump is projected the winner of 2016. You remember that evening? Was that the craziest? That was the craziest thing. And they thought, I think they didn’t think it, but I’ll tell you what anything we had then, we have much more now. They don’t understand. They do understand it. They do. Right? They understand it. Look at that beautiful dress. And she wears that dress right through the middle of Hollywood and everyone says, thank you very much. Beautiful. Like it. But they want to indoctrinate your children and implement a ruin or shutdown of the United States economy again. Biden said the other day, well, if the experts told me. We’re not shutting it down again. We don’t have to. We learned about the disease. We did the right thing. We saved millions of lives. People don’t realize we saved millions of lives and hundreds of thousands of lives by not letting China. We put a ban on China, heavily infected. And Biden was against it. Three months later, he said he did the right thing, I have to admit. It’s clear why both China and the flag burning rioters want Biden to win. They know his policies will be the downfall of America and they know my policies will lift America to new heights of national greatness like we’ve never seen before. That’s what’s happening. That’s what’s happening. And never forget, they’re coming after me because I’m fighting for you. There’s a lot of truth in that one. And they do come after me. They do come after me. They have more things to say about me. Every day, it’s something. They said, you see the plane where it is? Sir, would you like to take the car? I say, why? I’m saying what? Well, I heard you had a limp. I do? I don’t know about a limp. I don’t have a limp. Hey, someday, I’m going to have a limp. I’ll let you know when. You’ll see it. No, they make this stuff up. They make it up. They make stuff. It’s called disinformation. They give a phony deal out. They did it two days ago with the military. There’s nobody that loves the military more than me. I was very lucky though. I had 15 incredible American Patriots that came by and they said, he never said that. They were there. They were there. But they make up stories, horrible stories, many, many. Hey, look, look at last time, the fake dirty dossier. It was all made up. And frankly, if the shoe was on the other foot, if it was on the other foot, you’d have many people, 20, 25 people right now in jail for two years and they’d be there for 50 years because they got caught spying on our campaign and it’s treason or whatever else you want to call it. And it’s a disgrace that it’s taken this long. It’s a disgrace that it’s taken this long. And let me just tell you a little secret. Obama got caught and so did sleepy Joe Biden. Remember Biden just sitting in the room saying, why don’t you use the Logan Act on General Flynn? Look at General Flynn, what he’s going through for years. If that were ever reversed, I’m telling you, you’d have many people in jail for many, many years and it would have started three years ago. It’s a disgrace, but let’s see what happens. Biden’s a globalist sellout who spent his career laying waste to American communities. And you know, he talks about like, well, he’s going to do this. He’s going to … He doesn’t have any idea. He has no clue. He’s going to do this. He’s been there for 47 years. And he just really left. He left three and a half, four years ago. So he just left, but he’s been there for 47 years. I’m going to do this. After 47 years, he’s had a change of heart. This is the craziest election. This is the craziest … Look, somebody said, what’s the difference between crooked Hillary Clinton and slow Joe? So the difference is the following. She’s meaner, probably not as nice. I don’t know. You can’t get any worse than her, when you think. But the big difference is she’s smarter than he is. Okay. He’s a nicer person, but he’s not smart. He never was, not in prime time and certainly not now. The Washington vultures ripped apart our towns in exchange for his party’s nomination. Biden has now formed an unholy alliance with the most extreme and dangerous elements of the radical left, you know that, with crazy Bernie and everyone. And by the way, you know who’s further left than crazy Bernie? Kamala, Kamala, Kamala. You remember she left the race. Sort of interesting that they picked her because in theory, they should be able to win in California. I don’t know. Maybe we’ll make a play for that one too. But they picked somebody from California. I don’t quite get it, but you always pick somebody that’s hot. That’s going up in the polls, going up. Frankly, I’m not sure. I don’t think I’ve ever said this, but probably Hillary should have picked Bernie Sanders to be her running mate. Right? Because as crazy as it sounds, he was hot. He gave her a hell of a fight. A lot of people think he won and it got taken away. One thing about Bernie, he’s the greatest loser I’ve ever seen because look, any children here? No not too many, but they’ve heard it before. He got screwed four years ago and he got screwed again. Biden got the nomination. He got the nomination. But if Biden would have sat back and if Elizabeth Warren, Pocahontas, you remember Pocahontas? She finally faded. She faded badly. But if she would have dropped out on Super Tuesday, prior to Super Tuesday, Bernie would have been the nominee. And I don’t know who I’d rather run against. One is super left. The other one’s had to become super left. One is competent. The other one is only half competent now and heading south. He’s half competent and heading south rapidly. But the globalists and the leftists make natural partners because they’re united by their contempt for the American middle class in the truest sense. That’s why powerful corporations and far left politicians have both sided with radical demonstrated over. If you look at that, it’s over the law abiding areas that we have. Republican cities and towns are doing great. We’re doing great. And we don’t have crime and we don’t have this violence. Chicago over the weekend, many people killed, many people shot, shot. They’re actually shot and killed. New York, the same thing. New York’s gone through the roof. They were up 300% in certain categories. And you say, what’s happening? And we want to send them in so badly. Joe Biden and his party spent the entire summer cheering on the rioters rampaging through a Democrat run cities falsely labeling them as peaceful protesters. And you know, we call you peaceful protesters, you know why? Because they have rules in these Democrat run states that if you’re campaigning, you can’t have more than five people. They did that for me. If you are going to church you can’t go to church anymore. You can’t go to church. You can’t go to church, you can’t do anything. You have to stay in your house but if you’re willing to riot, running down Main Street, if you’re willing to riot and stand on top of each other’s face and do whatever the hell you want to do, you’re allowed to do that because you’re considered a peaceful protester so we decided to call all our rallies peaceful protests. Instead of standing up to the far left rioters, Biden condemns law enforcement and condemns America. Didn’t even mention the words that we love and respect, law and order. You know [inaudible 00:21:51] even my people, my very brilliant consultants who I don’t listen to too much, maybe I should. “Sir, please don’t say law and order. That’s too tough.” Now in the meantime you look at these streets, people crazy. They say, “Say law and order but with safety.” I said, “Look, people get it. It’s just law and order, is that okay?” We want law and order. They say, “Law and order and safety, sir. Could you add the word safety? Because it’s …” I said, “I don’t want to add.” It’s sort of obvious, right? We want law, we want order. Biden is fueling the violence with his relentless attacks on police and his constant slander that America is racist. By the way I’ve gotten the support of almost every police group in the country. Sheriffs in Florida, Ohio, Texas, North Carolina. All over the country, but did you notice he’s starting to talk a little bit tougher now, did you notice that? He sees what’s going on, his polls are dropping like a rock and he sees what’s going on. Now he’s starting to say, “No, we need law and order.” No he didn’t say that, did he? He’ll never get to say that, can’t say that because then it’d lose the whole left and let me tell you the left is running that party. You take a look at … You don’t want to be dealing with the left. These people are stone cold crazy, you don’t want to be dealing. Meanwhile Biden, he doesn’t say a word about the thousands of African-Americans who are murdered each year as a result of violent crime in Democrat-controlled cities. They’re murdered by the thousands and they never, ever mention it. My heart is with the hardworking patriots of all backgrounds who build up our communities, not the violent criminals and extremists and agitators and anarchists who burn them down. Next time you see video of screaming far left maniacs shouting wildly at peaceful Americans, remember this. These are Biden supporters, and if he wins, they will be in charge of your government as sure as you’re sitting there. You’ll be taking your monuments down. You’ll be taking your statues down. I’m not kidding, you’ll be taking them down. You have to look at the D.C. report, I’m just telling you, go get it, you wouldn’t even believe it. It’s too crazy to even talk about, but we’re never going to give them a chance to do it. We’re never giving them a chance. We’re going to win, we’re going to win big. This is a very important state, and by the way, when they send out their millions and millions of unsolicited ballots, when you get a ballot, say, “Well I wanted to go and vote, darling. I wanted to go and vote. Why are they sending me those ballots?” There’s something really … The only way we lose North Carolina and a couple of others like Nevada, we’re doing great there. Now the governor decides we’re doing so well that they’re going to send out unsolicited. You have solicited and unsolicited. They’re going to send out millions of ballots to you. People that never really thought in terms of it. Now sometimes you’ll ask for a ballot. That’s a solicited ballot. It’s okay, you have to go through a process, you have to sign the form, you get it. Sending out millions of unsolicited ballots. Make sure you send the ballot in and then go to your polling place and make sure it counts. Make sure it counts. Because the only way they can win is by doing very bad things. That’s the only way. Look at this. If Joe Biden came here and made a … This is not the most convenient place. It’s an airport. Hi fellas. They did a good job guiding the plane. They’re great. They’re great. No, really. This is an airport. Honestly, I really … If he had 200 people, I think it would be a lot. I really mean it. You ever see the gyms with the circles? That’s his crowd. If he had 200 people. I was told we have 15,000 people here tonight. [inaudible 00:25:57] as far as the eye can see, but they’ll correct it. They’ll say, “He’s wrong, it was 14,500, he’s misrepresenting. He’s misrepresenting.” Now I was told we have 15,000 and we’re in the middle of an airport someplace. It’s a wonderful thing. I actually think … I don’t know if you agree. So we go to the arenas but because of China, the arenas aren’t working out too well, right? You can’t really do that anymore for a while but we are rounding the turn, I will tell you, we’re rounding the turn on that but because of that … So we said where because we have the same crowds. I think we have bigger crowds potentially. We were in New Hampshire the other night, we had to turn away 8,000 people at an airport. We’re doing all mostly hangar things because we’re outside. Outside is very much different than being inside according to the great doctors, right? But they say it’s very much different. So we’re doing these and we’re doing the outdoors, we’re doing the hangars, but I really believe that these crowds are bigger than they were four years ago. It’s pretty amazing. It’s pretty amazing. We started off in New Hampshire, we said, “Look, let’s have 1,000 people,” and they had like five or six show up and they had thousands more. We’re trying to be nice but then eventually we landed … Two weeks ago, we landed in New Hampshire and the entire runaway was lit up with thousands and thousands of people as the plane was landing and I mean it’s really amazing what’s going on. All over the country, it’s amazing. It’s amazing. It’s a great thing. More support than we had four years ago because four years ago I said I was going to do this, I was going to cut your taxes, I was going to cut regulations, I was going to get right to try, I was going to take care of your vets, I was going to rebuild your military, I was going to do all these things and you said, “I don’t know. That’s a lot of …” You know what? I’ve actually done more than I promised. Build a wall, build a wall, true. I’ve done more. For instance you never heard me say, you never heard me say, a lot of you were at various rallies, you never heard me talking about space force. We built, think of it. A new branch of the United States military, the United States Armed Forces called Air Force. I never talked about that. That’s something we never talked about. I only figured that one out after I became president because I saw what Russia was doing and what China was doing. I said we have to do the same thing, and if you think that was easy, that was not easy. That was not easy, it was very hard. But what we’ve done … You know the wall now is past 300 miles. It’s exactly the wall that our great Border Patrol wanted. I was hoping a nice concrete plank for the builders in here, boom, boom, you put it. “Sir, we have to be able to see through.” I said, “All right, let’s go. Much more expensive.” I said, “Let’s go.” So we’re over 300 miles now and we will be finished with it very soon and we have among the safest borders that we’ve ever had by far and it’s a good time to have it too. You know Mexico is paying for the wall just so you understand. They don’t say that. They never say it, but we’re going to charge a small fee at the border, the toll booths. We have toll booths. It’s the biggest border in the world in terms of people going across and in terms of industry, believe it or not, the southern border. We’re putting a small toll on and maybe we’re going to do something with remittance. That’s when people come here, make money and they send it back, so we’ll do something and we’re going to get all the money that we spent on the wall will be coming back so … Remember I used to say who’s going to pay for it? They’d say Mexico [inaudible 00:29:47]? That’s right. Mexico is going to pay for it. What happens if they fight us? Remember that answer? It’s going to get 10 feet higher. Remember that. What happens if they fight us on the wall? The wall’s going to get 10 feet higher but now Mexico and I get along great. In fact they have 27,000 soldiers along our southern border protecting us from people coming to our country. Can you imagine that? 27,000, and I did that so that we don’t put tariffs on their products coming in, it was very simple. I said you got to do it and the president’s been great, he’s a friend of mine, he’s doing a very good job. Not easy, Mexico’s not easy, but he’s doing a very good job, but the wall is almost completed and it’s a tremendous wall. It’s everything that the Border Patrol wanted. I gave them everything. I said, “What else do you want?” It’s wired for every single thing you could have. Remember the Democrats, “We don’t want a wall, we want drones flying.” Oh that helps us a lot, drones, so you can watch everybody pour in to our country, right? Biden supports cutting police funding and he has pledged to end cash bail. Just last week Sleepy Joe proudly accepted the endorsement of the pro-criminal anti-police Portland District Attorney who has a policy of releasing rioters, vandals, criminals and violent extremists without charge. Now last night though, they arrested more than they’ve ever done because we said you have to. We said you have to and we told them about … We will federalize them, we’ll do whatever you need and I spoke to the governor, it looks like they’re finally, after 107 days, like they’re finally doing what they’re supposed to be doing but we’ll let you know very soon. Otherwise we’re going in. The Biden-Bernie manifesto pledges to implement these same policies nationwide. Now you got to understand, Bernie’s a radical lefty but not as bad as her but a radical left and I got a lot of Bernie voters. I think 15% last time because they agree with me on trade. They understand that many of these countries including our so-called allies are ripping us off, they’re ripping us off on trade. I agree with him on that. The difference is I know how to do something about it, they don’t. They don’t have a clue. They just know they’re being ripped off, and a lot of Bernie people feel that. That’s a big point and they came over and they voted for me instead of Crooked Hillary which was a very nice thing. We appreciate it, we hope we don’t lose it. Because we’ve really implemented things. We’ve taken in billions and billions and billions of dollars for China, from China, and China’s never given us $0.10. It’s a one-way street with China. They haven’t given us … We signed a great trade deal but the ink wasn’t dry when the plague came in so I view that trade deal much differently than I did before, much differently. It’s a great deal. They just last week, they ordered the biggest order of corn in history, the biggest order of soybeans in history, and I say just shows you though they’re smart, very smart. Instead of saying he’s not talking very nicely about us and we’re not going to order any more, we’re not going to do business, no. Instead they do the opposite. They give us the biggest orders … Our farmers are very happy. Our farmers are very happy. Biggest order of corn, biggest order of beef, biggest order of soybeans, and I gave the farmers $28 billion because that’s what you were targeted for by China and I gave you 28 out of the tariffs and we had tens of billions of dollars left over which went into the U.S. Treasury but nobody’s ever done this before. Nobody’s ever done this before. With Biden it’s the reverse. His son goes, sits down for 10 minutes with the father and whoever the hell they sat down with. Walks out with one and a half billion dollars to manage, he’ll make millions of dollars a year, and he has no experience at all. Never happened before. Biden’s plan is to appease the domestic terrorists. My plan is to arrest them. So on November 3 America faces a very simple choice. Do what you want, vote for the candidate backed by violent left wing rioters if you have to, or do what you want to vote for the candidate backed by the selfless heroes of law enforcement and just about everybody else. Wait till you see the numbers. Wait till you see the numbers. You know there was a poll that just came out, I think it was Gallup, and it was a weird kind of a poll because it said 62% of the people that are polled are lying. I said, “That’s a big number, right?” I think it was 62% a couple of weeks ago it came out, and they’re only lying if it’s us because they don’t want to be bothered. In other words they’re not lying about Sleepy Joe, they’re lying about us, and I don’t know if I’m supposed to love that or hate it, I don’t know if it’s an insult or not but I will take it. We don’t give a damn. If that’s the case, we have a virtual landslide going. We have a virtual landslide and this would look like it. We’re joined tonight by some really great friends of mine, representatives, senators, just some incredible people. People that have really helped me and we have to get them in office and let’s start off with Senator Thom Tillis. Thom, thank you. He’s been by my side. Thank you Thom very much. Representatives Greg Murphy, Virginia Foxx, Mark Walker, Dan Bishop, and Ted Budd, what a group. What a group. What a group, thank you fellas. They’re warriors. Boy I’ll tell you, those House guys, they were in there, they were fighting for us. We’re 196 to nothing, right? When Crazy Nancy impeached us, right? They impeached me for making a phone call that was perfect, it was a perfect call. I’ll go down as the only president in history that got impeached for making an absolutely perfect phone call. Thank goodness I had the call because they totally misrepresented what was on the calla. If you ever heard the Shifty Schiff get up in Congress and say what I said, [inaudible 00:36:17] it would have been terrible, but you know what? Fortunately we had really talented people taking down everything word for word. We had the call perfectly and if I didn’t have it, somehow with these people I guess I’d still be here if you want to know the truth, but it was a lot easier but we were 196 to nothing, the Republicans stuck together, and Kevin McCarthy’s done a fantastic job. He really has. With the exception of a half a vote from Mitt Romney, you can have him. He’s not too popular, I want to tell you, he’s not a very popular guy in Utah. He’s not too popular. So it was 52.5 to a half. He’s a beauty, I’ll tell you that guy. He couldn’t get elected dogcatcher in Utah right now. Remember Utah, they said it’s too close to call, this was before the election, and they announced Utah, the polls are closed, Donald Trump has won the state of Utah. Do you remember that like immediately? I won by a lot and there was some guy running, McMuffin, McMuffin. McMuffin, he was supposed to be second. Even Hillary beat him. What a group. Lieutenant Governor Dan Forest, Dan? Get out and vote for him. Get out and vote for him, okay? I’ll tell you he’ll be a great governor. He loves your state, he’ll be a great governor. Thom is going to be a great, great senator for another six years, we need them both and I hope you’re going to do well, Dan. I know you’re really getting up there, it’s getting very close. I’ll be honest, if this governor that you have, I know him. You know we had to take our convention away, he said you’re allowed to have 10 people in the arena, 10, because it said one room 10, you’re not supposed to have political rallies. I said, “You know the money that your state is going to be losing?” But if this guy doesn’t open up your state, because almost all of them are open now, if he doesn’t open up your state, you have no choice, you’re going to vote for him anyway but Dan, you’ll be so good. Dan Forest, go and vote. The Republican nominee for North Carolina Attorney General, Jim O’Neill. Jim? Where is Jim? Thank you Jim, thank you very much. Good luck. Got to be careful with those ballots, watch those ballots. I don’t like it, you know you have a Democrat governor, you have all these Democrats watching that stuff. I don’t like it. I look at these crowds and if they’re going to cheat crowds are meaningless. Really, if they’re going to cheat, these big beautiful crowds, you could have 15,000, you could have 50,000, these crowds are meaningless. Watch it, be poll watchers when you go there. Watch all the thieving and stealing and robbing they do. Because this is important, we win North Carolina, we win. We’re going to win Florida, I just left Florida, we’re going to win Florida. North Carolina Republican Party Chairman Michael Whatley North Carolina, great. Thank you Michael. Thank you, great job, and a very good friend of mine, a great guy, Mick Mulvaney. Where’s Mick? Oh, I didn’t know Mick was here. Look at him. What a good guy. Thank you Mick. We have a lot of big shots over there I see but what do you think about a guy named Mark Meadows, chief of staff? We love Mark. Doing a great job. He’s doing a great job, Robert O’Brien. Robert, how many hostages have you and I negotiated to get back, not giving anything but we have a record of what, Robert? 50, 50 and 0. We’re 50 and 0 on hostages. We got them back, we got hostages back from countries that you’d never even heard of and it’s been pretty amazing. Robert, thank you very much and thank you all for being here. Mick it’s good to see you. Oh wait a minute, wait. It’s a very, very outstanding senator. Oh I’m lucky I got to see that. We love South Carolina, right? Come here. Lindsey Graham everybody, Lindsey Graham. Lindsey and Tim Scott, two great ones. Two great ones. They may be from a different state but they love you Lindsey. That’s good and Tim is another one. So we have just incredible people in the party. We’ve achieved more in four years than anyone ever thought possible and that’s driving them crazy. We passed massive tax cuts like nobody ever thought was possible for hardworking families and we eliminated a record number of job-killing regulations, more than any president in history whether it was four years, eight years or in one case more, regulations, and to keep family farms in the family, we eliminated the unfair estate tax also known as the death tax on your small farms and businesses. Remember, that was a terrible thing. People were fighting for that, your family lost the farm, lost their small business because they had to go and pay this ridiculous estate tax or death tax as they call it. And now you don’t have to worry about it. If you love your children, you leave it to them. If you don’t love your children, then it doesn’t matter what I did. Don’t leave it to them, give it to charity, give it to someone else. If they’re not good to you, if you don’t love… But does anybody here not love their children? Please raise your hand. You. Nobody. Good. I love that. Look at that one. You’re going to love that one, I guarantee. I guarantee you’re going to love that one. That’s a keeper. That’s a keeper, right? That’s great. You’ll love that one. Someday in a long time from now that beautiful child will not have to worry about estate taxes unless the Democrats do something in between, but we-No, but it was a terrible thing. You’d pass away and your kids would get the farm, they’d go out and borrow a lot of money because the estate tax was massive. They’d put big mortgages on the farm, they’d lose the farm, they’d lose the business. You don’t have that anymore. I saved the US auto industry by withdrawing from the last administration’s job-killing catastrophe, the Trans-Pacific Partnership was a disaster. For half a century, Joe Biden shook hands with blue collar workers, and then he turned around and immediately stabbed them in the back. Biden supported NAFTA, China’s entry into the World Trade Organization, TPP, the South Korea disaster deal and mass amnesty for illegal aliens. Think of it. But the big deal is, he’s changed. He’s changed. “After 47 years I’ve changed. I swear to you I’ve changed.” Did you see him in the debates? He was not too good, but that’s okay. He was better against Bernie. Something’s going on there, I don’t know. You know what I’m talking about. But he was better against Bernie. But in the other debates, he was giving them everything they want. Free healthcare for people that come into the country illegally, colleges, everything. Now the new deal, under the new deal, they get lawyers. If they come in to our country illegally, we supply them with legal advice. You believe it lawyers? This is what we need, is more lawyers. This state lost 43% of all manufacturing jobs after the twin disasters of NAFTA and China’s entrance into the World Trade Organization. That’s courtesy of Biden and his friends. Earlier this year, I kept my promise to North Carolina when we ended the NAFTA nightmare and we signed the brand new US-Mexico-Canada Agreement into law, it’s been incredible. Everyone said, “Impossible.” They all said it was impossible to get done, we got it done. And it’s a great deal. And it prevents people, it prevents companies from fleeing your state, opening up in Mexico or Canada, making a product, selling it to us with… It’s such a disincentive to do that. Now that was the thing that was most important to me. I used to hate when I’d see all these companies leaving our country, going to Mexico in particular, but Canada also, a lot of them going to Canada and they’d make a product, everybody gets fired in our country, they close their business and they make the same product in a different country, they send it back to us, no tax at the border, no tariff, no nothing. It doesn’t work that way anymore. I took the toughest ever action to stand up to China’s pillaging, plundering, ransacking, and rampant theft of North Carolina jobs and US jobs. Joe Biden’s agenda is made in China, my agenda is made in the USA. In the face of China’s economic aggression, we provided a historic $28 billion in relief to our amazing farmers. I will always stand with American agriculture. These are the greatest people, the finest people, and we’re not going to let others take advantage of them. For 20 years, for 20 years, you look at a chart, it’s just been this way for 20 years. Now, it’s going back up. I mean, it helped that I gave you $28 billion in all fairness, right? If I didn’t do that, and I took it all from China, it was very easy. If I didn’t do that, I think you wouldn’t have any farmers right now. Really. It was a difference between having farmers that are doing well and having no farmers. 28 billion over two years, they got hit one year, 16 billion, one year 12 billion. I said to Sonny Perdue, Secretary of Agriculture, great guy, an ex-farmer, governor of Georgia for eight years, great guy. I said, “Sonny, how much are they being targeted for?” He said, “Sir, $12 billion for the year before, and last year sir was 16.” So I said, “28, okay, that’s fine.” I said, “We will give them 28 billion. They were unfairly targeted.” And that was in order to get me, and by the way, China wants Joe Biden so badly. Oh, they want… And you know who else would like them very badly? Iran would like them very badly. Because I ended that Iran catastrophe that we paid 150 billion and 1.8 billion, in cash. And you know what’s going to happen? They’re just waiting for the election because the country is going down the tubes. Their GDP went down 24%. Nobody ever heard of that before. Their country is in trouble. I don’t want them to be in trouble, but they’re going to wait till after the election. When I win the election, they’re going to come to us and make a deal so fast. Watch how fast it’ll be. They’re dying to make a deal, but they do want to wait. “Let’s wait two months, maybe we’ll get lucky. Maybe we’re going to get lucky and Slow Joe gets in and we’re going to make a great deal.” No, there’ll be in immediately after the election and they’ll make a deal, we’ll make a fair deal with them. But what Obama did and Biden did with that horrible Iran deal. I ended last administration’s war on American energy. Biden has pledged to end production of American oil shale, clean coal, no fracking, wiping out millions of jobs and forcing us to buy energy from foreign polluters. We don’t want to buy energy. We’ve done that for a long time, for decades and decades. We don’t want to do that anymore. I like being energy independent, don’t you? And I’m sure that most of you notice when you go to fill up your tank of gas in your car, oftentimes it’s below $2. You said, “How the hell did this ever happen? Thank you President Trump.” Right? Thank you President Trump. And look at your electric bills, everything else. These guys, your electric would go up four, five, six times. The Green New Deal, it’s called the green new nightmare. While I’m president, America will remain the number one producer of oil and natural gas on earth and we will remain energy independent. It should be for many, many years to come. Because the fact is, we don’t have to be in the Middle East other than we want to protect Israel. We’ve been very good to Israel. But other than that, we don’t have to be in the Middle East. We don’t need… There was a time we needed desperately, we don’t need that anymore. We have more than they do, isn’t that nice? After years of rebuilding other countries, we are finally building our country. America first. It’s America first. To bring hope to our inner cities, I created opportunities zones. I worked with Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, what a great guy. He has passed criminal justice reform, prison reform, delivered permanent funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities that Obama never did, or couldn’t do. And Biden. I call it Obiden. O Biden. It’s too long to say Obama and Biden, just call it Obiden. And before the China virus, we achieved the lowest African American, Hispanic American, Asian American unemployment rates ever recorded. And we’re heading back to that level rapidly. Biden spent the last 47 years betraying African American voters. He betrayed them. Look at 1994, take a look at that. He betrayed them, what he did to them. He closed the factories in Baltimore and sent them to Beijing. They were all sent to Beijing. So many people went there. They went to all parts of the world, but a lot went to Beijing. He shattered the plants in Chicago and sent them to Shanghai. Unlike the previous administration, under my administration we put America first. And actually, if we weren’t interrupted with constant investigations that went nowhere. And nobody has been through what I’ve been through as president of the United States, nobody. They used to say Abraham Lincoln got the worst press. I said, “There’s no way he got worse than me.” But Lincoln was very, very badly treated by the fake news. Maybe in his case, it was real. I can tell you, in my case, it’s fake. It’s totally fake. But nobody’s been and should never be allowed to happen again. Let’s see what happens. We caught them cold. Let’s see what happens. But if we didn’t have to… That takes time, and energy, and all other things. The time that we spent on this impeachment hoax, Nancy Pelosi with her hairdryer and the whole thing. “Everybody has to wear a mask. You must keep all beauty parlors closed.” Then she’s in a beauty parlor with no mask on. And then she said the biggest, the biggest [inaudible 00:10:31]. She could have said, “Okay.” She could have said, “You got me.” But she said, “I got set up by the beauty parlor owner,” who happens to be a Trump person by the way. I like the beauty parlor owner. She said, “I got set up by the owner of the beauty parlor. She set me up.” I said, “How are you going to deal with Putin, Kim Jong-un, and President Xi of China?” No, it’s terrible, she’s always preaching about the mask. “You got to wear the mask at all times, indoor, outdoor. When you go to bed at night, put the mask on.” I’ve spent the last four years keeping my promises and delivering for the African American community and when I’m reelected the best is yet to come. I’ll tell you that. Perhaps in no area have our opponents more thoroughly betrayed working families of all backgrounds than on the subject of immigration. Under my administration, we’ve achieved the most secure border in American history. Now, I have to tell you the 300 miles of wall helps a lot. Remember they said, “Walls are old fashioned. They don’t work.” Really? I always say, and I’ve said it four or five times. I’ll say it again if you’d like me to, two things if you come back in a thousand years, 2000 years, or 3000 years. If you’re lucky enough, assuming we have something with the world is a crazy place, isn’t it? But if you come back in a thousand years, there are two things, with all the computers, and all the everything changes every day, you invent a new cell, you invent a new laptop. Everything is obsolete like about two weeks after you invent it, right? Two things that will never get obsolete, the wall and the wheel, right? The wheel and the wall. Maybe I’m wrong, who knows? But I would say walls and wheels have a great future. We ended catch and release, stopped asylum fraud, and we’ve deported 20,000 gang members, including the radical MS-13. We invested $2.5 trillion in the United States Military, all made in the USA by the way, We have the newest, finest military we’ve ever had, and gave our great warriors their largest pay raises in many, many decades. We passed VA Choice and VA Accountability which everybody said could not happen, and veterans satisfaction with the VA has just reached 91%, the highest satisfaction level in history. I withdrew from the last administration’s disastrous Iran nuclear deal as I said, and I kept my promise and recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the United States embassy in Jerusalem. And then I recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, and we achieved the first breakthrough in the Middle East peace for many, many decades, decades. Even the New York Times said that was an amazing achievement. Do you believe that? I said, “Let me see that one.” Now we did something that nobody thought was possible. Man, it’s Israel, as you see, and as you’ve read, Israel and UAE, highly respected leader, Mohammed, highly, highly respected, and now we have other countries in the Middle East. They all want to come in. It’s going to be a beautiful picture, going to be a beautiful picture. We killed the vicious founder and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi, we killed him. Why didn’t Biden get him?k They were after him for eight years, they never got him, I got him. The world’s number one terrorist and the mass murderer of American crews, Qasem Soleimani, we got him too. Soleimani. Al-Baghdadi and Soleimani, the two worst terrorists in the world for many, many years, many decades. We kept America out of new wars and we’re bringing our troops back home. We’re bringing them back home from all these far away places. We spend hundreds of billions of dollars, and what do we get out of it? Biden voted for the Iraq war, he supported the defense sequester that gutted our military, he opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden, he opposed the killing of Soleimani, he oversaw the rise of ISIS, and for eight years he couldn’t find or kill al-Baghdadi, the founder of ISIS. Couldn’t find him, they looked, they couldn’t find him. I found him and we hit him good. We hit him good. And you saw the Mueller family on television. You saw that at the convention, what al-Baghdadi did with their beautiful daughter, and incredible how our troops handled that. You should see it, it was incredible. Biden also cheered the rise of China as a positive development, positive development for America and for the world. How are we doing with China? We just have the plague, we’ve had other plagues sent by them. I wonder if they did it on purpose, what do you think? I got to tell you, I was sailing to an easy election. This was going to be so easy. I probably would have not been here tonight. I would have said, “No, we don’t have to bother. This is going to be…” And now we have to work against a guy that doesn’t know where he is, I can’t believe it. When I banned travel from China, Biden called it hysterical and xenophobic. Do you remember that? I banned it. Everybody told me, “No, no, no, you don’t have to do that.” But I said, “We have to because Wuhan is very infected and they’re coming here,” so I banned it. Later on it was said to be a great move. If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died. If Biden wins, China will own America, and it won’t take long, with his son, Hunter walking out with all of that money with no experience whatsoever, no investment…He didn’t even have a job. Joe Biden is weak and will always cave to China who is strong. When the virus arrived, we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II. We’re delivering life-saving therapies and we have achieved some of the great numbers. The case fatality rates, we have the lowest of any major country in the world. People don’t know that because the fake news doesn’t want to write about it. Under Operation Warp Speed, we’re producing a vaccine in record time. This is a vaccine that we’re going to have very soon, very, very soon, by the end of the year, but much sooner than that, perhaps. And this is something that’s incredible. This would have taken two or three years by the last administration, and in all fairness, by most other administrations. We have upped it to a level that nobody even believes is possible, and totally safe. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, rated the most liberal, are undermining science and risking countless lives with their reckless anti-vaccine rhetoric. That’s what they’re talking about. So now they know we have it. It’s only a question of weeks or a small amount of time. So instead of saying, “That’s a great thing. We’re going to save lives,” they’re trying to disparage it, they’re trying to make it politics. They’re trying to do so. And now what’s going to happen is we’ll have it, and people won’t want to take it. That’s really bad. Okay? That’s really bad. But the Biden-Harris effort to spread anti-vaccine conspiracy theories only because they know we’re close to putting it out, getting it out, and we’re going to get it out fast. The vaccine will be safe. These are the greatest companies in the world to do this, the greatest labs, the greatest doctors, it’ll be effective and it’ll be delivered before the end of the year. And maybe as I said, much sooner than that. Joe Biden’s plan to impose a blanket shutdown would collapse our economy and cause countless deaths from suicide, drugs, alcohol abuse, heart disease, and much more. And that’s what you’re in right now. You’re in a shutdown. It’s crazy. I’ve been to many states, they’re not in shutdowns and they’re doing better. They’re doing better. Somebody’s got to speak to this man, Dan. Maybe you got to talk to him, Dan. Go in a little early and say, “You don’t know what the hell you’re doing? You don’t know what you’re doing. They’re hurting our people.” North Carolina has to open up. By contrast, my administration is following the science, protecting those at highest risk while allowing those at lower risk to safely return to work and to school, go back to school, go back to school. You ever see the statistics on young people? I don’t know. They have a great immune system. Let’s get some of that immune system, but they’re amazing. I mean, thousands and thousands of people and they’re not even affected, very little meaning a small percentage of 1%. It’s an incredible thing. Nobody knew that when it first came here, nobody assumed a thing like that was possible. But young people are very strong against this horrible disease. Through our historic China virus relief programs, we’ve saved more than 1.3 million jobs for North Carolina workers. That worked out great. We provided $380 million in relief for North Carolina farmers and made $10 million in PPP loans to save your state’s tobacco growers. We saved your tobacco growers. We have them very much in our sites. We want to help them. The Biden agenda would crush this comeback and put our families in grave danger. Biden is promising to reimpose job-destroying regulations. We got rid of more regulations, he wants to put those regulations back plus 50%. You couldn’t build a road. We took roads from 18, 19, and even 20 years approval down to two and we’ll have it down to one. You may get rejected for a highway or for a road, but you’re going to know in the period of 12 months to 24 months. You’re not going to spend an entire lifetime and then have them raise their hand. I know all about it from the real estate business, we brought it all the way down. He wants to give illegal aliens government healthcare and taxpayer funded lawyers, establish a national sanctuary city policy for illegal aliens with criminal records. You wouldn’t believe. I mean, this stuff is not even really believable, but it is what it is. He wants to surge refugee admissions by 700% into our country. Flooding your towns with poorly vetted migrants, including many from jihadist regions of the world. Biden opposes school choice, he opposes North Carolina opportunity scholarships. And he has stated that if he is elected, charter schools are gone. He said, they’re gone. And they’ve been incredible. In the second term I’ll provide school choice to every parent in America. And we’ll also take good care of our teachers. Our teachers are very, very important to me. Very important, nothing more important. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans. And just in finishing, I have to say that over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we will end our reliance on China once and for all. We’ll make our medical supplies right here in the United States. We will enact fair trade deals that create American jobs and grow American wages. We are going to bring our companies back home where they should be. I’ve been doing a lot of it, but we are going to do it at a level that nobody ever thought possible. We will rapidly return to full employment, soaring wages, and record prosperity. We will hire more police, increased penalties for assaults or law enforcement, surge, federal prosecutors into high crime communities and ban all sanctuary cities. We will protect government benefits for American citizens, not for illegal aliens. What you’re doing when you have all of these advantages, when you’re giving them free healthcare, and free lawyers, and free college, and free everything, they all come. They didn’t think of coming, but they see this, they talk and they talk to their friends and they all come in. They want to come to America. You’re just bringing people in and we don’t want to do that. We want people to come to our country, but they have to come in through merit and they have to come in legally, very simple. We will appoint prosecutors, judges, and justices who believe in enforcing the law, not their own political agenda. We will ensure equal justice for the citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed. We will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms. We will strike down terrorists to threaten our citizens and we will keep America out of endless ridiculous foreign wars. We’ll build up our military like it’s never been built up before. We need our military for other reasons. We will have the strongest we have now. When I took over, our military was depleted. We have a lot of military people here. Our military was depleted, our planes were 50 years old. Now you have brand new, beautiful F35s, we have brand new rockets and missiles. And hopefully we never have to use them, I will say that. But the best way of not having to use them is to have them. If you have them… We learned that in the school yards, right? We learned that in the school yards, the best way is to have them. We have the strongest military we’ve ever had by far. We’ll end surprise medical billing require, price transparency, which I’ve already signed into law, which by the way, kicks in on January 1st. You better elect me North Carolina. I did price transparency and I’ve cut the price. Drugs are going to start going down at levels nobody’s ever seen favored nations. So we did price transparency, kicks in January 1st. Could you imagine if this guy’s president and your prices start to go way down, hospitalization, doctors, you can choose your own doctor unlike with Obama, right? Price is going way down, January 1st. I said, couldn’t you start it sooner, but statutorily that’s when it had it start. Could you imagine if this guy’s in and prices start dropping like a rock? And they’ll say, What a great president he is. He would have never done it. And your drug prices, prescription drug, I’m instituting favorite nations laws. So we’re going to pay what other nations pay at the lowest. And you’rr going to get back rebates that were given to middlemen who have to be the richest people in the world. We’ll protect medicare and social security, and we will protect your social security. And we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions, always. America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. Very exciting. And I will reopen NASA. That place was gone. They had grass growing out of the runways, you had to see it. Now it’s the number one space center in the world by far. You see what’s going on. We will restore patriotic education to our schools. Oh, you know what I’m talking about. Look at you. This is a very sophisticated group, Tom. You know what I’m talking about, patriotic education. Well, the first thing they do is they want to take your history away. That’s a great group behind me. I don’t know. They’re activists. But you know what? You know what it means, they want to take away your history. That’s why the monuments and the statutes, they want to knock them down. The first thing they do is take away your guts. It’s guts. They take away your guts, they take away your statues, they take away your heroes. They take away your great generals. They take away your past. And I said, it was going to happen. I said, “You know what? They started off with generals and colonels and others that nobody ever heard of.” And I thought that was bad. And then they went up a little bit and now I said, “Someday it’s going to be Robert Lee, someday it’s going to be Washington, someday it’s going to be Lincoln. Someday it’s going to be Jefferson, someday it’s going to be Benjamin Franklin. It’s all of them. They take away your past. They never taken away our past. That’s the way they do it. You study it. That’s the way they go. They take away your guts. We’ll teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, In God we trust. This is better than the arenas, I have to say, especially when you have a crowd like this. But they’re like this. They have such spirit in this country. People love our country so much. I went to Texas, I went to Ohio, I went to Florida, it’s always like this. They love our country and we’re not going to disappoint anybody. We’re not disappointed. For years you had a president who apologized for America… So you had a president who apologized for America, now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the people of North Carolina. This is the most important election in the history of our country. I wouldn’t say that lightly. And frankly, I thought the last one was, and I said it, but they’ve gone to a level that nobody even thought possible. These people have gotten stone cold, crazy. And you know what? After we get in, we’re going to have tremendous success. And it was building. We were at a point, we were so successful before the plague came in from China. We were so successful that we were starting to get together. People forget. We were starting… Success brings people together. It was so good. Our jobs numbers were so good. And whether it was the Black community, the Hispanic community, the Asian community, our jobs were so good, our numbers were so good. We were getting together and then the plague came in and we had to stop. We had to close it up. We had to open it and start all over again. If you would have told me that we have one of the highest stock market, some of the stock markets have already broken every record. You look at NASDAQ, you look at some… We’re far ahead of what I had planned. We’re far ahead of schedule. But we did it once, we have to do it again because this was an unforeseen event, a terrible event, a horrible event. So many people died. Nobody should have died, not one person. So many people died, but if we didn’t do it right, we would have lost millions of people. Just a terrible thing. But oftentimes I say, bring people together. And then I realized, if you look at that last few months, we were starting to come together. I was getting calls from, you won’t believe it, Democrats. I was getting calls from Democrats and they were saying, “Wow, things are going really well.” It was starting to happen and now we have to get it back to a level of great success because it’ll happen again. There’ll be great unity, eventually there’ll be great unity. So get your friends, and get your family, get your neighbors, and your coworkers and vote. And I say this because it’s from Charlotte to Kitty Hawk, from Durham to Asheville, and from Wilmington to right here in Winston-Salem. We inherit the legacy of North Carolina Patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for this beloved nation. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blaze the trails, settle the continent, tame the wilderness, dug out the Panama canal, laid down the railroads, revolutionized industry, one, two world Wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And we are making it greater than ever before. Proud and great citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of North Carolina, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you North Carolina. Thank you.

"54","09-09-20","Oh, we were talking mostly about the virus, and I think he’s going to have it in good shape. But it’s a very tricky situation. It goes through air, Bob. That’s always tougher than the touch. The touch, you don’t have to touch things, right? But the air, you just breathe the air and that’s how it’s passed. And so that’s a very tricky one. That’s a very delicate one. It’s also more deadly than even your strenuous flus. People don’t realize, we lose 25,000, 30,000 people a year here. Who would ever think that, right? It's pretty amazing. And then I said, ""Well, is that the same thing?"" This is more deadly. This is 5% versus 1%, and less than 1%. So this is deadly stuff. Now it’s starting out it’s not just all people, Bob. But just today and yesterday, some startling facts came out. It’s not just old, older-Young people too. Plenty of young people. We’re looking at what’s going on in-Well, I think Bob, really, to be honest with you-I wanted to always play it down. I still like playing it down because I don’t want to create a panic."
"55","09-10-20","We brought you a lot of car plants, Michigan. We brought you a lot of car plants. You know that, right? Long time, it’s been a long time since you had all these plants being built, but we brought you a lot over the last three and a half years, and we’re going to bring you a lot more. That’s happening. Hello, Michigan and I’m thrilled to be in Freeland with thousands of loyal, hardworking American patriots. Fifty-four days from now, we’re going to win Michigan, and we’re going to win four more years in the White House. This is the most important election in the history of our country. Joe Biden devoted his career to offshoring Michigan’s jobs, outsourcing-We shouldn’t be smiling about it, but we’ve changed it around. Outsourcing Michigan’s factories, throwing open your borders, dragging us into endless foreign wars and surrendering our children’s future to China and other far away lands. Biden supported every disastrous globalist sellout for over a half a century, including NAFTA, China, and DPP. You know that. Joe Biden surrendered your jobs to China and now he wants to surrender our country to the violent left wing mob and you’re seeing that every night. If Biden wins, China wins. If Biden wins, the mob wins. If Biden wins, the rioters, anarchist, arsonist and flag burners win. But I wouldn’t worry about it because he’s not winning. I don’t think he’s winning. This is not the crowd of a person who comes in second place. You do know that. The same thing happened four years ago. It was election eve but by the time I got here, it was late. Some of you are in that audience at one o’clock in the morning now election day. We had 32,000 people show up and the reason I went is that I heard that crooked Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton and Barack Hussein Obama were traveling to Michigan because they heard they had problems. They were supposed to win Michigan, but they did such a lousy job that they had to come and get some votes. They came and I heard about it. They said, “Sir, could you do it?” I hopped in the plane. We landed at 12 o’clock in the evening. I started speaking at one o’clock in the morning now election day. 32,000 people. She had 500 people. I said, “Why are we going to lose Michigan?” And we didn’t. And we didn’t. First time in a long time, but now we’re up in the polls. We just saw polls. We’re up in Michigan. I don’t know if that’s good or bad. I don’t know. I don’t know if that’s good or bad because in all those polls where we were down last time, we won. So maybe we’re better off being down a little bit. Hello, John James. I see you handsome guy. John James, get out and vote for John. I’m going to introduce you in a second John James. What a job you’ve done. I have to tell you, he took, I saw this group of people that were running, all nice people, three very rich people and one guy that was John James and I saw them all. Right? I saw them all and I said, “Wait.” With the wonderful invention of TiVo, one of the greats, you can play it back. I said, “Who was that?” He said, “I don’t know, sir.” I said, “Play it back.” I said, “That man is going to be a star.” It was John James. That was in the Republican primary. After learning about him with his incredible career and helicopter, and he’s a great, and actually a great flyer I heard the other day, a great one, a really good one as opposed to those that aren’t so good, but his incredible background and education at West Point and all of the things he did. I said, “This guy” and I endorsed him and he went like a rocket ship. Frankly, if he had a little more support, he would have won the last time. This time, I hear you’re even, and maybe even ahead, and we’re going to win with John James. He’s a great guy, but I’m going to introduce him in a second. I’m running for reelection to keep jobs in Michigan. We have got a lot of … Last year before the China plague came in, we have the China plague. Thank you China very much. Should have never let that happen. They should have never, ever let it happen. They stopped it from going into China, but they didn’t stop it from coming out here and coming into the US, in Europe and the rest of the world, 188 countries. But it is what it is and we’re not happy about it and we’re going to remember it. We’re going to remember it, but we had in Michigan and in the country, the greatest economy in the history of the world, there has never been an economy. Now, we’re building it again and it’s being built fast. By the way, it’s turning out to be John, a super V. No more V. Now it’s starting out to be a super V, but to put violent criminals behind bars and to ensure the future belongs to America, not to China, because if we win, America wins and that’s what it’s about. If we win, America wins. Not only does Joe Biden want to eliminate your jobs, he wants to eliminate your borders. He’s promised to flood your state with refugees. You know that as well as I do. You see it all the time. From terrorist hotspots around the world, including Syria, Somalia, and Yemen, Biden’s pledged to have a 700% increase. He made this deal with crazy Bernie, a 700% increase in the flow of refugees. So, he wants to lift it up by 700%. This is in their manifesto. He’s also pledged to terminate all national security travel bans, overwhelming your state with poorly vetted migrants from jihadist regions. Making matters worse, he would open the flood gates in the middle of a pandemic. By the way, the wall, it’s over 311 miles long right now doing very well. Doing very well. Make the mic louder, the mic louder. Biden is waging war against the American middle class. I think most of you are not middle class. You’re upper class. You’re the elite. You know the way they talk about the elite, the elite, they’re really elite. I see them. They’re not elite. You’re the elite. The elite has decided. Boy, have we hurt the elite, haven’t we now? You’re the super elite. The left wants to get rid of me so they can come after you. It’s very simple. Over the last three and a half years, we’ve secured America’s borders, blocked the entry of foreign terrorist, fixed our disastrous trade deals and we have fixed our trade deals good. They are good. In fact, Biden was interviewed today on...There they are. CNN. No, he was just interviewed today. He was interviewed by Jake Tapper who I find to be a nice guy. I don’t think he likes me too much, but that’s okay. He was interviewed on CNN and they said, “Which is better, NAFTA or the USMCA?” He said, “No, no, the USMCA.” Tapper goes, “What?” Couldn’t believe it. He said USMCA. He made a mistake. From his perspective, he made a mistake because he doesn’t know what’s going on. Even though he’s right, he doesn’t know. There were a little surprised to hear that. They gave him a few chances. Let’s ask that question again, but we brought back our manufacturing jobs. We rebuilt the awesome power of the US military. We obliterated the ISIS caliphate and built the greatest economy in the history of the world. Now, we are doing it again bigger and better than ever before. Before the end of the year, we will have a safe and effective vaccine and we will defeat the China virus. I have a feeling … By the way, I think the vaccine is going to come very soon, going to come very soon. With it or without it, we’re rounding the turn. You see what’s happening. You see the numbers are plunging. You see how good we’re doing relative to other countries and other parts of the world, but the fake news doesn’t like saying that. They don’t like telling you that. Next year, unless you have somebody that’s going to quadruple your taxes, raise your taxes, raise up all of those regulations that we cut, next year will be one of the greatest years of the history of our country. At no time before has there been a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies, and two agendas for the future. There’s never been a vision like this. You have sleepy Joe and you have Trump. Sleepy Joe, he’s a beauty. He’s a beauty. He’s a beauty. I watched the Democrat debates, right? I watched them up there and he was so bad. I said, “There’s no way he makes it.” It’s sad, isn’t it? The first lady actually came in and one time she watched it and she goes, and she’s a nice person. She meant this really, me, I view it differently. But she looked at, she watched the debate and she watched Joe and she said, “Darling, it’s so sad.” This was early on. This is the guy I’m running against. It’s so sad. Darling, it’s so sad. But we got them. Joe Biden has put forward the most extreme platform and it’s not him. He doesn’t know what platform. He doesn’t. It’s your radical left people. It’s AOC plus three. It’s all these people. Bernie. It’s Bernie. It’s Kamala, the most liberal person in the US Senate. I tell it all the time. She started off her poll numbers at 15, 14, 12, 12. Then she went back up to 12 and a half. Then there was a big plunge right down to the bottom and then she dropped out. She dropped out, but there’s never been anything like this. No major party has ever had a candidate that’s so extreme in his views. Again, he took the manifesto drawn up by Bernie and the super lips and that’s what he’s going by, including a massive increase in your taxes and a total assault on your second amendment. On November 3rd, Michigan, you better vote for me. I got you so many damn car plants. I’ll tell you what, I’ll be so angry at you. I got you a lot of plants. Is that right? I mean, have you seen how we’re doing here? All the plants that have been built, are being built and what about the plants that are being expanded? They don’t want to give you credit for that. They just expanded. I went to Prime Minister Abe of Japan. I say, “Prime Minister, you have to start doing something.” He’s a great guy. He’ll be retiring soon. He’s a great guy, the prime minister of Japan, Abe. I say, “Shinzō, Shinzō, you have to do me a favor. You’ve got to send car plants over here. You’re sending all those cars. We stupidly don’t charge you tariffs on those cars that pour into our country. I said, “Shinzo, you got to give us plants.” “No, no, no, I can’t do that. That is up to the free enterprise system of Japan.” I say, “Shinzo, you’re a powerful man. You can do it.” “Oh, I can’t do it.” The next day they announced five car companies are coming to Michigan. Right? [inaudible 00:22:28]. Now they’ve been building it for a number of years, but you hadn’t had a plan built in like 42 years. They were the old plants. And it’s been amazing what’s happened in Michigan. But honestly, it’s been amazing what’s happened in Ohio and North Carolina and South Carolina and Florida and New Hampshire and so many other places. Our country is doing great. We had to take a pause to get rid of the China virus, and we got rid … We’re coming around. We’re coming around that turn. I’m telling you, you watch, next year, better than last year. It’s going to be better than last year. Michigan will decide whether we will quickly return to record prosperity, or whether we’ll allow Sleepy Joe to impose $4 trillion in tax hikes, ban American energy, confiscate your guns, shut down the economy, and tell your governor to open up your state. It’s all Democrat governors. And I think they do it for political reasons because there’ll be less activity. You’d be doing even better if you had a governor that knew what the hell she was doing. You got to open it up the state. And also, you have to have a governor because right now Michigan’s lagging. Great football, great coach, great team. We want a governor, John James, that’s going to let Michigan play Big Ten football this year. You’ve been seeing a lot of the other schools want to open Big Ten at my suggestion. How about Sleepy Joe? He said, “Donald Trump is against football.” No, no, no. I’m the one that says open it up, let’s play football. These people practice disinformation like nobody has ever practiced it. They’re liars. I’ll tell you, they lie. But we have a good chance. You have a very good commissioner, and the commissioner is working hard, and hopefully, very soon they’ll say you’re going to play football. And I hope they’re not leaving Michigan out because it’s never the same if they do. But you have Maryland, where they have a problem in terms of playing. And the governors have a lot of power over that. They have a lot of power, a lot of say. So let’s play Big Ten football, right? They want to shut down auto production, delay the vaccine. They want to destroy your suburbs. Look at what I’ve done for your suburbs. You know what I’ve done. You know what I’ve done. Does anybody want to have somebody from Antifa as a member and as a resident of your suburb? I don’t think so too much. Say, “Darling, who moved in next door?” “Oh, it’s a resident of Antifa.” “No, thank you. Let’s get out of here. Let’s get the hell out of here, darling. Let’s leave our suburbs. I wish Trump were president. He wouldn’t have allowed that to happen.” And that’s exactly right, I won’t allow it to happen. The suburbs are the American dream, and I will tell you, I have protected your suburbs. I got rid of a regulation that played with your zoning and played with other things, where they force projects into the suburbs of our great country. And I got rid of it. They said, “Sir, we can amend it and make it less crazy.” I said, “No, I don’t want to amend it. I don’t want to do that. I want to get rid of it.” “Well, sir, why don’t we just do a simple amendment? It would be” … I said, “I want to get rid of it. End it.” And we ended it. We ended it. I think the people living in the suburbs … which I know very well. I watched Westchester in New York where they were doing things that should never have been done, and it’s not going to happen to our suburbs. They want to erase your borders and indoctrinate your children with poisonous anti-American lies in our schools. Not going to happen. Not going to happen. For the last four years, they’ve tried everything to stop us, and they are only getting more desperate by the day. Can you imagine if on September 3rd, they say, “Ladies and gentlemen, Donald Trump has been declared the winner. Donald Trump has been declared” … At first, they’ll go crazy. And then they’ll say, “Okay, it’s time now to be reasonable.” They will have had it. They will have had it. We were coming together as a nation. Very interesting. Before the plague came in from China, we will coming together. It was success. Somebody said, “What’s going to bring you together?” And it was. We were coming together. I was starting to get calls from Democrats that … Frankly, we didn’t speak much. And I was starting to get calls, and then all of a sudden we saw the plague pour in, and we saw what was happening, and it really stopped things. But success was getting very, very close to bringing us all together. And then we had to say, “Let’s take a time out. We got to fix this mess.” And we did, and now we’re coming back strong, but success brings us together, and it was happening, and then we got that terrible situation happened, and we’ll never forget it. Biden and his party tried to lock law-abiding Americans into their homes while they encourage rioters and vandals rampaging through, in all cases, Democrat-run cities. Republican-run cities are doing very well. I hope you know that. And I hope you know, like in Minneapolis, we were asked to come in, we went in, we took care of that problem in about, what, 30 minutes? Unfortunately, they let almost two weeks go by. And if you look at what we just did in Wisconsin, which was so amazing, three days, and we went in. And by the way, the US Marshals went in to get the killer, and that was the end of that. They got the killer, they got the killer. You know what I’m talking about. And we were going to go into Seattle. The next day, we’re all set, all lined up, looking forward to it. We just said, “We’re doing it.” I mean, they actually took over a part of the city, and the mayor said, “This is going to be a summer of love,” right? Where do these people come from? But we were all set to go in there, heard we were going in, we informed them we’re going in, and they sent their police to do it, and we never even had to go in. But we can solve those problems in a matter of literally minutes. Thank you. Don’t say that, I’ll start to cry, and that wouldn’t be good for my image. You don’t want to see me cry. I’ll start to cry. One of the fake news broadcasters, because this happened the other day, we had a tremendous crowd like this. I mean, we had a tremendous crowd in North Carolina. They started chanting, “We love you. We love you. We love you.” And it’s incredible, they said with all the years that they’ve been covering presidential elections, they’ve never heard that chant that, “We love you.” No, it’s very nice. No, they’ve never heard it. True. Now they’ll say, “He misrepresented. 18 years ago, there was a rally held by somebody, and we heard the words from two people that, ‘We love you, sir.'” Now this is what we’re dealing with. And by the way, I look out, there’s a lot of people that … Look at this. There’s people back there that can’t even get in. Thank you, Michigan. Thank you. It’s really nice to be with you. As president, I will always support the heroes of law enforcement. I was very honored to receive the endorsement of the Police Officers Association of Michigan. Where are they? Where are they? They’re here someplace. Where are they? Thank you, fellows. That’s really nice. I’ll tell you. That’s an honor. I have to be honest. I got it from Florida, Texas, Ohio, North Carolina, South … But Michigan is Michigan. Thank you. I don’t think there’s any law enforcement officer that is against us. What is our poll number? 99. I know they had 365,000 at one group, and they got a unanimous vote. I said, “That’s pretty good”. How can you go the other way? You people are fantastic, and we love you. Thank you. That’s great. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Biden says he wants to protect Black lives, but his radical platform will cut short the lives of thousands of young African American citizens. Thousands. The murder rate in Democrat-run cities like Chicago, Baltimore, New York, so many others is higher than in Afghanistan, yet Biden supports imposing these failed policies nationwide. You will have crime like you’ve never seen before. You’ll have crime like you’ve never seen. Last week, Joe Biden proudly accepted the endorsement of the pro-criminal Portland district attorney, who has a policy of releasing rioters, criminals, and violent extremists without charge. Biden’s plan … And every time I say Biden’s plan, it’s not his plan, it’s the people that tell them what they’re going to do, so please understand. I just don’t want to say that every time I mention his name. So it should say, “The people that control Biden’s plan” is to appease domestic terrorists. My plan is to arrest them, to lock them up. If Joe Biden is elected, far left lunatics won’t just be running failed Democrat city, they’ll be running the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, and the United States Supreme Court, and we can’t let that happen. No city, town, or suburb will be safe. On November 3rd, your vote will save America. Remember, it’s the most important election we’ve ever had. I’m joined tonight by some great warriors that have really helped me a lot in Washington with the fake impeachment, the impeachment hoax, the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax. Somebody said Russia’s coming up again. Adam Schiff said, “We’d like to find out about” … I said, “What about China? What about other countries?” It’s always Russia. Russia, Russia. They’re at it again. I want to just thank these guys because these were real warriors for all of us. They love your state, and they love our country. Congressman Jack Bergman. Great job, Jack. John Moolenaar. Thank you, John. Great. Great going, John. He’s a tough cookie. And Tim Walberg. Tim, thank you. Great job. What great people. And I talked about him a little while before, I could talk about him all night. He’s a star. He’s going to be a future star. We have a very much different party than we had four years ago. We’re now the party of the workers. We’re the party of a lot of different things now, but we weren’t really considered the party of the workers. Certainly not anymore. Remember this, we’re the party of Abraham Lincoln. A lot of people forget that. Honestly. Remember when they used to say, “he doesn’t act presidential”? And I used to say, “It’s so easy to be presidential.” I’d only have about 10 or 15 people here. You’d be bored. But remember I used to do that? But I’d always say, “I can be more presidential than any president in our history, except for the possibility of Abraham Lincoln when he wears his hat.” Tough to beat. That’s tough to beat, John James. But seriously, if you want to be well-represented … Your current Senator, I don’t even know this guy. I don’t even know this guy. Nobody does. They don’t know who he is. They don’t even know. He comes into the office, I say, “Who is that guy?” I know every Senator. Democrat, Republican. I don’t know this guy. I know your other Senator. I can tell by her hair. She’s got interesting hair. But that was John’s first crack. He learned a lot. And frankly, and I mean this, if he had more support from the Republican Party, he would’ve won that race. He would’ve. But this guy Peters, right? Peters. I say, “Who’s Peters?” Nobody knows him. He doesn’t do anything. I mean, look, we’re going to end this, but I have to tell you, John James can be so great. He loves our country. He’s been educated at the highest level. He was always the top at everything he’s ever done. And this is what he has. And I’ll be honest with you, John. I think I can tell this story. John and I were thinking about John. I was thinking about John more than myself because I know talent. And I said, “John, you can run for a certain House seat, right? And you’re guaranteed to win. You can run for another House seat. It’ll be a tough race, but you’re going to win. Or you can have a tough race against somebody that nobody ever heard of. It’s like a habit that they press that particular trigger, but that’s a tough race. So you can be an absolute Congressman, or you can take a shot at this one.” He said, “Sir, I can do more in the Senate than I can do in the House.” And that was his decision. Right? Took a lot of guts. So John, I’m with you. You have my total and complete endorsement. You have everything I can do. Everything I can do, we will do for you. And I really believe you’re going to make it. You’re running against somebody that is just ridiculous, folks. It’s ridiculous. Don’t do it. Also with us are some other great candidates and people that are going to do a tremendous job, helping our Congressman. Paul Junge. Where’s Paul Junge? Paul, thank you. Good luck. I heard you’re doing well, Paul. Paul Junge. Lisa McClain. Lisa? Great job. It’s going well. And Eric Essahki. Thank you, Eric. Good luck. Good luck. We’re going to be out here helping you, too. We’re going to be out here. I hope John doesn’t even need help, but we’re going to help John, too. We’re going to help all of you. All right? We’re going to be doing it. Thank you. Also with you is RNC Chairwoman. She was the head of the whole state, and she kept calling me back, back. “Sir, one more speech, you’re going to win Michigan.” Hadn’t been won in decades. “One more speech, sir, you’re going to win Michigan.” I said, “All right. Ron, I’m coming in one more time, but that’s it.” I said, “That woman is the most aggressive person I’ve ever met.” She said, “I’m telling you, sir, one more speech.” I said, “All right, I’ll do it one more time, but that’s it.” About a day after I got back, I said, “I just got back from Michigan. It was wonderful.” I get a call from Ronna McDaniel, and she goes, “Sir, could you come in tomorrow for another speech?” Well, whatever happens, she is the one that got me here at midnight on … She is. So when it came time to picking the head of the RNC, as president, you have a couple of things to say about it, right? I said, “Who’s that woman that kept getting me back to Michigan? Boy oh boy, she’ll be great.” Ronna McDaniel. And somebody’s doing a fantastic job and tells us we’re really pretty far ahead. Maybe way ahead. They had a poll. I think it was a Gallup poll. They said 62% of the people are lying about their poll. Now, they’re only lying having to do with my … And I don’t know if I’m supposed to be insulted by that or not, but we’ll take it. But we could have a very big win. And look, no president has done for Michigan what President Trump has done for Michigan. And you’re going to remember that. And I’m going to remember Michigan. Michigan GOP Chair Laura Cox. Great. Thank you. Great job. Great job. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thanks, Laura. We spent the last four years reversing the horrible damage Joe Biden inflicted over the last 47 years. 47 years of bad votes. After the last administration nearly killed the US auto industry, I saved the US auto industry. Joe Biden supported the disastrous Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would have been a death sentence for American auto jobs. I withdrew from the TPP my first week in office. That was so easy. That was so easy. You wouldn’t have been making cars. You would’ve been buying cars from foreign lands. We have enough of that. Biden supported the horrendous South Korea deal that would’ve wiped out US production of the pickup truck, which is the most … The pickup truck is the most profitable thing the auto industry makes. You know why? We have something called the Chicken Tax. Does anyone know what I’m talking about? The Chicken Tax. It’s a tariff of 25%, and it keeps other countries out of here, and it expired, and South Korea didn’t want to do it, but they did it. We got it right back, and we put it on for a long time, and now you’re making … But remember this, go check it out. The Chicken Tax. I’ll tell you why someday at another meeting why they call it that. Maybe you don’t want to know about it. But we’re keeping those small trucks, and we’re keeping our whole industry good. And we’re expanding our autos now, our cars, and we’re doing a great job of it, and I want to thank everybody. Doing a great job. And by the way, many other things in Michigan. Biden supported the outrageous fuel economy standards that have hammered the auto industry, and I reversed that rule. I actually reversed it, and it helped millions of families be able to afford a car. The United States lost 500 auto and auto parts factories under the Obama-Biden disaster. Before the virus, my administration added over 200 new auto and auto parts plants. How about 200? I didn’t know that. 200. 200. I thought it was a little less than that. Wait, I want to see that again. 200. It says 200. Do you believable it? That’s a lot. You know, I have a choice between teleprompter and freelance. I hate to say, the freelance is always a hell of a lot better, but-If you remember, and you remember well, I actually got elected because of freelance. We didn’t have teleprompters. There were no teleprompters. But think of that, 200, we’re talking about 200 plants. I thought it was a much lower number. I thought you should put me in an office based on a much lower number. At 200, you have no choice. Yesterday, Biden was in Michigan. He said, “I better get out of the basement.” This guy is starting to do very well lying about his lifetime of cold hearted globalist betrayals. Biden championed NAFTA, perhaps the worst trade deal in the history of our country. He continued to embrace and promote NAFTA for decades. I told you, he just said it was not as good as the deal I made. I can’t believe, oh they’re giving him hell tonight. They’re giving him hell. What did you say that for? Boy oh boy. Yeah, hiding. ‘Joe Hiden.’ Look, this doesn’t sound nice. I’ll say it, and they’ll criticize for it, you watch. But I have the distinct pleasure of running against the worst presidential candidate in the history of presidential politics. I really believe that. I do. Can you imagine if I lost to him? I’d have to say I lost to the worst candidate ever put up. Don’t do that to me, Michigan. Don’t do that. Biden supported China’s entry into the World Trade Organization, which, by the way, was a disaster. China was flatlining for years and years and decades and it got into this World Trade Organization with all sorts of advantages. Just a terrible, terrible situation took place. That’s when China became a big, powerful economic power. But, if you look at the numbers just before the plague, now, the numbers are different, we were going up, up, up, we were beating them like a drum. They weren’t even close. We were gaining, gaining, gaining. We were number one by far. You know, for years I’ve heard that in 2019, China was going to surpass us. Well, in 2019, we gained a lot on them. We were doing great. We were doing great and we’ll be doing even better next year, you watch. Yesterday it was revealed that a fund partly owned by Joe Biden’s son, where’s Hunter? See his first name, I now name … His first name is where. Where’s Hunter? He must be a brilliant guy because with no experience he’s taken more money from more countries. He had no job and then he became rich. But where’s Hunter who facilitated the sale of a Michigan automotive company to a leading Chinese military defense contractor? Does anyone know that China’s military got yet another piece of American manufacturing, Mike and the Biden family made a lot of money on it. It was a lot of money. What about Ukraine? He got $183,000 a month, $3 million upfront and he had no experience with energy, working for an energy company, by the way. What’s your experience, Hunter? What’s your experience with energy? “I don’t have any.” “Okay. We’ll pay you 183,000 a month and I will give you an upfront payment, Hunter, of $3 million. Will that be satisfactory?” He goes, “Yes. I’ll take it.” Would anybody here not take that deal? Anybody? Please raise your head. This is one guy, right, you must be a pretty rich guy. If Biden’s elected, China will own America. Washington vultures like Biden and others ripped apart entire towns all across your state. Michigan lost half of all manufacturing jobs after the trade deals that Biden supported. By the way, I don’t know if anybody … But does anybody remember like 12 years ago? Long before I thought about running for president, when I enjoyed my life, I had the greatest life. “Where would we like to go? Let’s go to Monte-Carlo this weekend. Let’s go.” No, I had a great life, but I was honored. I was doing very well. I was honored in Michigan. Does anybody know that? I was given man of the year award by somebody? I came in and I spent like 45 minutes talking about how you’ve been ripped off, how all your auto companies are leaving and going to Mexico and, by the way, to Canada too. But how they’re all leaving and going to Mexico and Canada. I spent the whole time talking about it. At the end I felt embarrassed, I said, “I hope I haven’t insulted the state too much, but why do you let this happen?” I stopped it. I stopped. It won’t be happening. It won’t be happening. It’s not going to happen anymore. Biden took a sledgehammer to your state earlier this year, I kept my promise to Michigan workers when we ended the NAFTA nightmare that everybody said was impossible to end, and when we signed that brand new US- Mexico-Canada agreement into law. The USMCA includes powerful wage protections to keep auto manufacturing jobs right here in Michigan. Now they have a tremendous disincentive to leave Michigan, fire all of our workers, go to Mexico or Canada, make the car or the product, send it in here without tariffs. We end up with closed factories, no job and no taxes. That’s not happening anymore. That’s not happening anymore. But do you remember how bad it was just before I took office? It was like an avalanche of companies leaving our country. I also took the toughest ever action to stand up to China’s rampant theft of Michigan jobs. Biden has vowed to remove these tariffs and allow China to resume its pillaging. Just so you know, China’s paying us tens of billions of dollars a month. Before me, China never paid anything. They didn’t pay us 25 cents. You know what I did with some of that money? I gave it to our farmers. I don’t know if we have a lot, do we have farmers here? We have farmers. Raise your hands farmers. That’s not bad. No, I gave $28 billion to our farmers because they were targeted by China. They were targeted. They said, “You know …” and that’s what they did in the past to other presidents. They said, “If you do this, we’re going to stop doing business with your farmers and you’re not going to be able to get any votes and you’re going to lose the Midwest and all of that.” I said, “You know what? I do, whatever you want.” Then I went to Sonny Perdue, Secretary Of Agriculture, a great guy, I said, Sonny, “How much are they being targeted for?” “Sir, $12 billion the first year, two years, three years ago, and then 16 billion, a total of 28 billion.” I said, “That’s okay. We’re putting tariffs on everything they send into our country, 25%.” Was going to raise it to 50%. Also, 10% at 12%, all different tariffs. We took in billions and billions, and I said, “You know what we’re going to do? We’re going to take, of that, the 12 and the 16, $28 billion and we’re going to give it to our farmers who were targeted,” and our farmers are doing great. That’s what we did. Do you think Joe Biden would do that? He wouldn’t have a clue. Hillary wouldn’t have had a clue. Crazy Bernie wouldn’t have, nobody would add a clue on that one. By the way, we had tens of billions of dollars left over. You know what I did with that? We gave it to the US Treasury, right smack into the heart of the US Treasury. And we’re still getting those big tariffs. Even though we made a trade deal with China. I said, “No, you got to leave the tariffs on.” A lot of people didn’t know it. Schumer went, “Well, I don’t like to do …” First of all, he didn’t like tariffs, and then all of a sudden he loves it. But when I made the deal with China, I left the tariffs on 25% and some different amounts. When I left tariffs largely on and nobody could believe it. I said to Schumer, “What do you think of the deal?” “I don’t like it because you got rid of the tariffs.” I said, “No, we left the tariffs on.” This is what it is. No matter how you do it, no matter how good the deal, they’ll say, “It’s no good,” because they don’t love the country. They don’t love the country. Remember that. Joe Biden’s agenda is made in China. My agenda is made in the USA. That’s a nice plane. Somebody said to me, “Your plane’s just as nice as that.” I said, “No, it’s not. That’s Air Force One. That’s the nicest.” Always, that’s the nicest. I also authorize millions of dollars to save Michigan Soo Locks, and forget all the problems they had. For years and years, they fought over the money to do it. We got $300 million to the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, and we have done a job on the Soo Locks. They were rotting you. Weren’t going to have anything come through the Soo Locks. It’s all done. That deal is all done. It’s all done. Right? Thank you. Thank you. Where are my guys there? Good job. Right. Even though you’re law enforcement, that’s a good job, right? Two months ago, I also issued a major disaster declaration in response to the catastrophic flooding caused by the failure of the Edenville dam. Where are the people from Edenville? Yeah, good. No, that was a terrible thing and they’re working very hard right now. We’re providing more than $43 million in federal funds to help homeowners, businesses and communities in central Michigan to recover from that catastrophe. And you know, it’s a privately owned dam. I think we’re going to have to sue the ass off of the company that has it, I don’t know. No, I don’t know why we’re doing it. I’ll tell you why we’re doing it, our great Congressman. Thank you, Congressman. Great job. Thank you. He called up. He said, “Sir, we have to do it. It’s a private dam.” I said, “Well, if it’s a private dam, don’t they have to do it?” Say, “It will never happen.” Right? But we’ll end up getting some of that back, I think. Great, great representative you have. I want to tell you, [inaudible 00:56:47]. Thank you. Perhaps in no area have our opponents more thoroughly betrayed working families of all backgrounds than on the subject of immigration. Under my administration, we’ve achieved the most secure border in American history. We’ve ended catch and release, stopped asylum fraud, and we’ve deported over 20,000 vicious gang members and over a half a million criminal illegal aliens. As I said, we’ve already built over 310 miles of border wall. It’s all going to be finished very quickly. We’re averaging about 10 new, brand new, beautiful miles every single week. It’ll be finished very short. We’ve invested $2.5 trillion in the US military. All made in the USA, by the way. All made in the USA. You know, with the fake news today, I said, “And we have systems and missiles and rockets and military and tech. We have systems that you’ve never even seen before. President Xi has nothing like it. Putin has nothing like it. Nobody has anything like what we have.” They said, “Is he giving away military information?” No, I’m saying, “We have the greatest weapons in the world.” That’s what I’m saying. They said, “He may be giving away classified information.” You don’t have to worry about it. These people are sick. Never speak well about our technology because you’re giving away classified information. Now, I just want to let people know, we have the greatest systems, the greatest equipment and the greatest people anywhere in the world. There’s nobody like the US military. We have the most powerful military in the world. When I took it over, it was depleted. It was in trouble and was exhausted from these ridiculous, endless wars that lasts 19 and 20 years, and you know, those soldiers are starting to come home very big. You know that right? They’re all coming home and we launched the first new branch of the US Armed Forces in nearly 75 years since the Air Force, we launched the Space Force, very, very, [inaudible 00:59:32]. We passed the MISSION Act, we call it VA Choice and VA Accountability. We hold people accountable if they don’t treat our vets good, you’re fired. Get out. You’re fine. We did more in 47 months than sleepy Joe Biden did in 47 years. That’s true. We did more. That sort of has a nice ring to it. Right? Think of it. We did more and it’s true. Just take a look, Space Force, by itself, that would be a major achievement, and with us, we did so many things, so many things. But we did more in 47 months than he did in 47 years. It’s true. It’s true. A lot of what I did is destroy some of the horrible things that they did, including regulations all over the place. I withdrew from the last administration’s disastrous Iran nuclear deal. We paid $150 billion, 1.8 billion in cash. We ought to speak to law enforcement about that. How do we send 1.8 billion in cash? In cash? You guys ought to take a look at that please. I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. Every president said they were going to do that and none of them did it, for decades and decades, they all said. I tell this story, it was a hard thing to get done. It was easy to talk about in the campaign, “We’re going to open up the embassy in Jerusalem. We’re going to make it. It becomes automatically the capital of Israel.” Everybody said it for very, very many decades, for decades, many presidents. But I realize now why it was an effort because as soon as I got in, I was lobbied by everybody, “Please don’t do it. Don’t do it. Don’t make the capital of Israel Jerusalem. Don’t move your embassy.” So went on and on. Then I said, “Let’s do it anyway.” It’s true. And the word got out. The word got out that I was going to do it, and I was called by every king and every queen and every prime minister and every … Everybody was calling me, “Please sir, don’t do it. Please.” So I did what we sometimes will do in business, I told them … When a king calls, when somebody calls, an Emir, when somebody calls, tell them, “I’ll call them back in a few days. I’m sorry, sir. He won’t be able to speak right now, he’ll call you back on Wednesday. Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.” On Tuesday, I announced that I’m doing it. Then I got on the phone with 18 different companies. I go, “Hey, how you doing? You called, I’m just returning your call.” “Oh, it’s too late, sir. We called about Israel. It’s too late.” I said, “Gee, I’m sorry. I wish you got to me a little bit sooner.” I recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights and we achieved the first breakthrough in Middle East peace in decades. And by the way, on Wednesday, I believe of next week, Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and as you know, the country, a very powerful, very respected country with a great leader, the UAE, is coming to the White House and we’re going to sign an agreement that hasn’t been signed in many decades. It’s peace and its recognition of Israel and all of the things, nobody thought it could be done. It’s an amazing thing. I don’t say this out of ego, but I was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. Now, I have to tell you, that’s sort of a big thing and the networks and most of the news didn’t cover it. Could you imagine? When Obama came to office, they said, “We’re going to give him the Nobel Peace Prize.” He actually said, “What did I do? I didn’t do anything.” He didn’t do anything for eight years, frankly. But he said, “What did I do?” They gave it to them in a matter of weeks, right? Weeks. With us, we’ve done so much. We have done so much on so many different fronts. Remember North Korea? Remember? They were going to be at war with North Korea. Where’s the war? Where’s the war? Where’s the war? And we have a good relationship with Kim Jong-un. Who knows what happens? All I know is, we’re not in war and that’s okay. They said, “But he gave away so much.” I said, “I gave away nothing.” “No, he gave away so much.” When I said, “What did they give away?” You know what they said? “Uh, we don’t know.” I said, “Here’s what I gave away, I gave away nothing.” They said, “Oh, but you agreed to meet.” Oh, I see. I agreed to meet. So now they’re saying, “I agreed to meet, it was such a big deal.” Instead of being in a war, I think agreeing to meet is okay, right? And we did. He’s a different kind of a guy and he’s a smart guy, a very smart guy. We get along. Getting along with foreign powers is not a bad thing. We’re trying to teach that to the media and these idiots that ran our government for so many years. These fools. These fools. You know, you got nuclear weapons, you got big armies, big navies, “He gets along with Putin. That’s a terrible thing.” No, it’s a good thing. If I get along, that’s good. He likes me. I like him. Not so bad. “He gets along with Kim Jong-un.” That’s a terrible thing. No, it’s a good thing. I’m trying to convince him. It’s okay. It’s okay not to go to war. It’s really okay. He gets along with President Xi, he gets along with Prime Minister Abe. He gets along with a lot of people, and it’s okay. That’s a good thing. It’s really hard. These stupid people that have been running this operation for 30, 40 years, and they come out against me, and all they did was stick us in these endless wars. We’re fighting for sand and blood. Sand and blood. Syria, what do you get out of it? You get sand, you get blood, you get injuries, you get death. These people don’t know what the hell they’re doing and it’s one of the reasons I got elected, I can tell you that. We don’t like his foreign policy. And this is said by one of the guy’s that got us into the war in Iraq, got us into the Middle East. So, it’s … We’re doing a great job. We’re doing a great job for you. We’re doing a great job for Michigan. Just to finish in the Middle East, we killed the founder and leader of Isis, Al-Baghdadi. And by the way, we’re pulling back and we’re doing everything so beautifully. If we do get into war, we win the war. We don’t fight for nothing. We fought for nothing. We don’t ever want to have war but if there is a war, nobody’s going to even come close to being able to beat us. And we won’t be depleted from fighting in all these ridiculous locations all over the globe. You people know that a lot better than the idiots in Washington that has represented us for 35 years. We took out the world’s number one terrorist and the mass murderer of American troops, Qasem Soleimani is dead. We kept America out of new wars and we’re bringing our troops back home, and they’re coming home very rapidly. You see that. Sleepy Joe Biden voted for the Iraq War. He supported the Defense Sequester that gutted our military, destroyed our military, set us back so many years. I got rid of it immediately. He opposed the mission to take out Osama Bin Laden. He was against it. Everything he did, he was wrong on as said by Gates, you know? Secretary of Defense, Secretary of everything. He was sort of like … He had more jobs than any human being I’ve ever seen. But he said, “Everything, everything that Biden was for was wrong.” He opposed killing Soleimani. He oversaw the rise of Isis. He was unable to do anything with Isis. I had the leader of a very important country in my office recently, and he said, and I’ll probably refer the press, they’ll say, “Who is it?” He said, “Thank you, sir. You were the one that got rid of Isis.” I said, “I was the one? You’re actually giving me credit?” He said, “Absolutely. When you took over, Isis in Iraq and Isis in Syria was all over. It was growing at a level like we’ve never seen. You came in, and you absolutely wiped it out.” Happens to be … The man that said that happens to be the leader of Iraq, and he was very nice. He was very generous [inaudible 01:09:54] as he came to the White House two weeks ago. And we cheered as we looked at all of the success that we’ve had but he really oversaw the rise of China as a positive development. Remember, he said, “No, it’s a positive development for America and for the world.” He’s been in Washington for 47 years now. He’s all of a sudden going to change? He’s going to change? He’s not going to change. Don’t forget, he was in Washington in his primetime, which was never considered great, and now it’s no longer primetime. When I banned travel from China, Biden called it hysterical and xenophobic. If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died from the China plague. Biden was willing to sacrifice American lives on the altar of open borders. And now Joe Biden is once again hurting innocent people with his dangerous anti-vaccine conspiracy theories, putting millions of lives around the world at risk. And the only reason he’s doing that is he knows we’re right next to having a vaccine. So, he wants to belittle the vaccine because he doesn’t want us to get credit. But again, it’s not him, it’s the people surrounding him. When the virus arrived, we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II. Recently, I visited the workers at Ford’s historic [inaudible 01:11:27] plant, who converted their factory to produce tens of thousands of ventilators, after we invoked the Defense Production Act, and they’ve done a fantastic job. Not a single American who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator any time in our whole country. They needed a ventilator, we had nothing. We were left, bare cupboards. I always say the cupboards were bare. We’re delivering lifesaving therapies, and have achieved among the lowest case fatality rates anywhere of any country in the world. Europe’s excess mortality rate is 24% higher than the rate in the United States. You don’t hear that from the fake news. Hey, America will prevail over the China virus, as Franklin Delano Roosevelt said, “The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.” That’s it. We’re doing very well. As the British government advised the British people in the face of World War II, “Keep calm and carry on.” That’s what I did. This whack job that wrote the book, he said, “Well, Trump knew a little bit.” They wanted me to come out and scream, “People are dying, we’re dying.” No, no, we did it just the right way. We have to be calm. We don’t want to be crazed lunatics. We have to lead. When Hitler was bombing, I don’t know if you know this, when Hitler was bombing London, Churchill, great leader, would oftentimes go to a roof in London and speak, and he always spoke with calmness. He said, “We have to show calmness.” No, we did it the right way and we’ve done a job like nobody. All of those great generals, all of those great admirals, our great vice president, Mike Pence, they did a fantastic job. Our doctors, and they don’t get any credit because they want to discredit us as much as possible because they want it to carry over to November 3rd, but we’ve done a fantastic job. I think we’ve probably done the best job of any country, certainly of any major country anywhere in the world on the pandemic. Through our historic relief programs, we’ve saved more than 1.6 million Michigan jobs, and over 128,000 Michigan businesses. Michigan has already gained and regained more than half of the jobs that it lost, and if your state was ever allowed to safely reopen by your governor who doesn’t have a clue. She’s like Joe. You would have regained far more than that. Open up your state, Madam Governor, open up your state. Let’s go. Just like crazy Nancy Pelosi, your governor is a liberal hypocrite who lives by a different set of rules. Her husband was caught trying to put his boat in the water on Memorial Day weekend while she was ordering the people of Michigan to stay in their homes, and forcing businesses into bankruptcy left and right. The Biden agenda would collapse our economy and destroy this great opportunity that we’re having right now. He would impose job destroying regulations that would demolish the auto industry. You know, on regulations, it took, in many cases, 18, 19, 20 years to get a roadway or a highway approved. We have it down now to two years. We’re trying to get it down to one year, and it may get disapproved for environmental or safety reasons, but we’re going to know about it very fast. No more 20 year approvals or disapprovals. He wants to force you to provide free government healthcare to illegal aliens. He will destroy your social security. He will destroy your protections for pre-existing conditions, and we will save social security. Remember they said last time? “Oh, Trump is going to destroy social security.” Well, it’s now four years, we haven’t touched it. We’ve protected it, and that’s going to remain that way. Biden opposes school choice and has stated that if he’s elected, charter schools, so important, are gone. In a second term, I will provide school choice to every parent in America. A vote for republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans, instead of letting Washington change us, despite all that we have been through, we are changing Washington. And in conclusion, although I hate, I really do, I hate to conclude, I hate to conclude because I love being with you, I do. I do. So, in conclusion, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world, and we will end our reliance on China once and for all. We’ve been doing it [inaudible 01:17:41]. We will make our medical supplies right here in the United States, and right here in Michigan. We will enact fair trade deals that create American jobs and grow American wages. We will rapidly return to full employment, soaring incomes and record prosperity, and that’s already happening. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, surge federal prosecutors into high crime communities, and we will ban sanctuary cities. We will appoint prosecutors, judges and justices who believe in enforcing the law, not their own political agenda. We will ensure equal justice for citizens of every race, color, religion and creed. We will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms. And you’re lucky I’m here because you’re Second Amendment would be gone if I wasn’t. And they didn’t touch it. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens, and we will keep out people, keep them out of these horrible, horrible situations where they hurt our country, they hurt the people of our country, and we’re also going to be staying out of the endless ridiculous foreign wars in countries that you’ve never even heard of. We will build the most powerful missile and cyber defense. We’ve already got it, pretty much. And we will maintain peace through strength. We will end surprise medical billing, require the biggest thing that nobody even knows about and it’s all signed and it goes into effect on January 1st. You better make sure I win. Can you imagine? This is going to be the biggest thing and nobody understands what it is. You’ll figure it out. Price transparency. Did they fight me on that one. January 1st. And further reduce health insurance premiums and the cost of prescription drugs at a level like you’ve never seen before. I’ve already signed it. Favored Nations. The drug companies are not happy, I will tell you. Just, all you have to do is take a look at all the ads they’re running against me. Favored Nations, where we pay whatever the lowest is in the world, we pay that number. We will protect Medicare and social security, and we will always protect our patients. We will always our people. We will your pre-existing conditions, as I said. America will land the first woman on the moon, and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. We will restore patriotic education, you know what I mean by that, and we will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, In God We Trust. And I don’t know if you saw it, but during the Democrat National Convention and Caucus, they took twice, I thought I was sort of, maybe they made a mistake, you saw that, they took the word God out of the Pledge of Allegiance twice. And then they said, “Oh, well maybe it was a mistake.” It wasn’t a mistake. That’s where they’re coming from. Don’t be foolish. That’s where they’re coming from and there’s nothing that Sleepy Joe Biden can do about it. For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for Michigan. So, get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors and your coworkers, and get out and vote. So important. From Grand Rapids to Saginaw, from Kalamazoo to Mackinac, and from Flint to right here in Freeland, we stand on the shoulders of generations of Michigan patriots who gave their blood, sweat and tears for this beloved nation. This is the state where Henry Ford invented the assembly line. It’s the place where General Motors, Chrysler and Kellogg revolutionized entire industries. Michigan, well, you know this one, right? Michigan gave us Motown, right? That’s right. That’s right, Motown. We love Motown. Michigan gave us Motown, gave us Motown, gave us the Mustang and the unrivaled might of the American Midwest. This is the state where tough, strong and determined workers made America into the greatest and most powerful nation in the history of the world, and we are making it greater and greater every single day. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together, we will be taking back our country, we’ll be taking it back from people that don’t love our country and that take back is almost complete. We have to win on November 3rd. We’re returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting. And we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning, we are going to keep on winning. Vote for John James. John James. We need John James. We are one movement, one people, one family and one glorious nation under God, and together, with the incredible people of Michigan, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, Michigan. We love you, Michigan. Thank you. Thank you.

You’re going to save that pen. Thank you, Aaron. I want you to know that your dad is one of the bravest men anywhere in the world. You know that, right? You knew that before. I think you knew that before we knew it. So congratulations to both. With us also is our first lady. Thank you, darling. And Vice President Mike Pence. Mike, thank you very much. Along with Secretary of Defense, Mark Esper. Mark, thank you. Congressman Richard Hudson. Richard. Richard, thank you very much. Secretary of the Army, Ryan McCarthy. Thanks, Ryan. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mark Milley. Mark, thank you very much. It’s amazing the way all these big generals are showing up. This is something, huh? This is the big one, as I say, always do. It’s always will be. The Army Chief of Staff, James McConville. James, thank you. Thank you very much, James. And Sergeant Major of the Army, Michael Grinston. Thank you, Mike. Thank you very much. I also want to recognize the three medal of honor recipients that are with us. Matthew Williams, Edward Byers, and Walter Marm. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you. That’s great. A lot of brave people are with us today. Pat grew up in a small town in South Carolina. His dad is a police officer. His grandfather served in World War II and Korea, Vietnam. Service to our country really goes through their veins very, very rapidly. Exactly 19 years ago today, on September 11, 2001, news of the attack on our nation’s great, great country. This was just an attack like a has never happened to us. But it went through Pat’s high school and went through his classroom. And Pat was sitting there listening. His teacher solemnly told the students that their generation had a fight to win. They were going to fight and fight to win. In that moment, Pat was called to action. He knew that his country needed him. 10 short months later, at the age of 18, Pat was in Army basic training at Fort Benning. Soon he joined the elite ranks of the legendary Army Rangers. Pat became an exceptional soldier and expert sniper. He saw heavy combat in multiple theaters of battle. In 2010, during a deployment in Afghanistan, his leg was severely wounded by an enemy grenade. While recovering in South Carolina, Pat met with his wife, Alison. Well, that was probably not a bad wound then, was it? It was worth, I hope you’re going to say it was worth it. It was less than two years after being injured, Pat competed against some of America’s toughest warriors and won the prestigious Best Ranger Competition, among the most grueling physical contests anywhere in the country. In October of 2015, on his 14th deployment, Pat was part of a team assigned to plan and conduct an operation to rescue over 70 Kurdish prisoners being held by ISIS barbarians in Iraq. The team soon received horrifying intelligence that the terrorists were planning to massacre their captives and bury them in freshly dug graves. Pat and his teammates raced into action. After midnight on October 22nd, Pat boarded a helicopter and departed on a mission to free the hostages from two buildings guarded by dozens of ruthless and bloodthirsty ISIS terrorists. He was in command of a team clearing one of the compounds. As soon as the ramp to his helicopter went down, Pat rushed into a blistering hail of gunfire. Pat and his team swiftly overpowered the enemy, secured the building, and freed 38 of the hostages. Then Pat received word that the rest of the assault team was facing harsh resistance in another complex. Pat turned to one of his fellow soldiers and said, “Let’s get into the fight right now. Let’s get into the fight.” He saw that the other building was on fire and he knew more of the hostages were still trapped inside. He and his team climbed up ladders to the roof and opened up fire on the enemy. Multiple ISIS fighters detonated suicide vests, ripping a portion of the building into pieces. But Pat and his fellow Rangers fought through the fire, the bullets and the deadly blasts. Pat navigated to the front door and saw the captives were being held behind a metal door secured by two very heavy padlocks. He grabbed a pair of bolt cutters and ran through smoldering flame and smoke. As bullets impacted all around him, Pat succeeded in cutting one of the locks before scorching, sweltering heat forced him to leave the building for some air. Pat caught his breath in a few seconds and was back. He ran right back into that raging blaze, he sliced the final lock and released the rest of the hostages as the building began to collapse. He received orders to evacuate, but he refused to do so. He didn’t want to leave anyone behind. Pat ran back into the burning building that was collapsing two more times. He saved multiple hostages and he was the last man to leave. He wouldn’t leave no matter what they said, no matter who ordered him to do it, he wouldn’t do it. He was the last one out. It was one of the largest and most daring rescue missions in American history. Pat and his team rescued 75 captives and killed 20 ISIS terrorists. Pat, you embody the righteous lorry of American valor. We stand in awe of your heroic, daring, and gallant deeds. You truly went above and beyond the call of duty to earn our nation’s highest military honor. Pat would be the first to remind us that he was not alone that day. In the battle, one army ranger made the ultimate sacrifice, Master Sergeant Josh Wheeler. Josh was something, right Pat? Josh was something. You’ve said that before. Today, we’re deeply moved to be joined by Master Sergeant Wheeler’s wife, Ashley Wheeler. Ashley, our hearts break for your loss. A great man. That was a great man. Ashley, where is Ashley? Ashley, please stand up. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you, Ashley. Our nation endures because fearless warriors like Josh are willing to lay down their lives for our freedom. Our children can grow up in peace because Josh had the courage to face down evil. Our debt to him and to you is everlasting. And again, thank you very much, Ashley. We appreciate it very much. We will honor him forever. You know that. Very special group of warriors, men, great men. Pat has said that as soon as our soldiers boots hit the ground, they are ambassadors of the American way of life. Everywhere they go, the men and women of our armed forces instill our friends with hope, our enemies with dread, and our fellow citizens with unyielding American pride. Over the course of his service, Pat has embarked on an astounding, really an astounding 17 deployments in defense of our nation. General Milley, that’s a lot, right? Is that a lot? That’s a lot. Okay. I needed that little extra confirmation. That’s a lot. He now serves as an instructor at the US Army Special Operations Command training the next generation of American warriors. Today, he joins the immortal company of our most revered American heroes. Pat, you personify the motto, “Rangers lead the way.” And you inspire us all. It is now my privilege to present Sergeant Major Thomas Patrick Payne with the Congressional Medal of Honor. I’d like to ask the military aid to come forward and read the citation. Thank you very much.

"57","09-12-20","Well I think a statement like that is criminal because we did a much better job than he could ever have done. As you know he was months later before he even thought the ban was a good thing and ultimately he had to apologize for what he did. We would have lost hundreds of thousands of lives and what I said to Woodward was actually good. I said calm, we need calm. We don’t need panic. You want me to jump up and down and start screaming, is everyone going to die, is everyone going to … That’s not what leadership is about. I’m a cheerleader for the country. We need calm. That’s all I’ve said, and by the way, that was done after, that was done after I had already banned China –From coming into the country. So I took big steps. So Jeanine, I took tremendous steps, everybody knew how I feel, otherwise I wouldn’t be banning China and then shortly thereafter I banned Europe. We saved hundreds of thousands of lives with each one of those bans and saved probably two or two and a half million lives by doing what we did early. Look, he is an opportunist and not a bad guy to be honest, he’s doing his thing. His first book I didn’t have anything to do with it and he wrote things that were false and untrue and I could have straightened it out and I said, “Let me do,” I took quite a few phone calls, 16 phone calls or something like that and we had some good conversations, not long, but good conversations. I don’t even know if the book is good or bad. I can tell you that what this says is that I said don’t panic, we don’t want panic. The press will make everything look bad because it’s fake, the fake news, most of it. I’d say 85% unfortunately, that’s the number we’re up to. But I discussed with him lots of different things. I think that they were very good discussions. We’ll see how it comes out but on this subject if you look, and he’s actually being [inaudible 00:02:37] because if he thought it was wrong, then he should have reported it early. If lives were going to be lost, he should have reported it early. The truth is he didn’t think there was anything wrong with it and I think that he thought it was surprising that the press even picked it up. It’s fake news. It’s all fake news. Well go out and look at the great leaders of the world. Winston Churchill stood on the rooftops in London, very calm, making speeches. Winston Churchill. You want calmness. You don’t want to somebody going to be jumping up and down. I could do that too. I could jump up and down, say, “Oh, this is terrible. This is terrible.” We want strength, we want leadership and we don’t want panic. They don’t want it because they think it’s going to make me look good and it wins the election for me but we’re very close to a vaccine. We also have already come out with therapeutics. If you look at remdesivir and others, the plasma, you take a look at the things that we’ve come out with already and the number, we’re 85% better in terms of fatalities. You look at the kind of numbers, I don’t know if you’ve been seeing this but we’re really rounding the corner and this is actually without anything further than we already have and we have some very good things out there already in terms of … I would say in terms of … You can’t use the word cure yet but pretty close to a cure. You’re going to be pretty close to a cure. The vaccine itself, I mean it could come out in October, but whether it’s October, November, December, it’s going to come out very soon. We have great companies that are very advanced and the results are going to be very good. Well it would be a disaster and we’re setting records on job production. We’re 10.4 million for the last four months. Nobody’s ever seen numbers like this, we’re setting records by millions and millions of jobs. The country’s coming back, it’s a super V, it’s beyond a V, it’s a super V, retail sales are beyond any number they were ever at. I mean think of it, we’re doing numbers now as we’re rounding I think the final turn, and that’s with, without, it doesn’t matter. With or without. Having the vaccine is great, it’s going to happen very soon. Could happen in October, it could very well happen October but we’re rounding the turn on the virus. They have to open up. It’s only the Democrats that are closed and in my opinion they’re closed for political reasons. They have North Carolina, you have Michigan, you have a couple of other states that are …New York, I mean, look at New York, what they’re doing in New York, that poor city with the restaurants. You can’t go to a restaurant. It’s like a ghost town. What they’ve done to New York and people are leaving is disgraceful between Cuomo and DeBlasio. That combination, I’ve never seen anything like it in my life. Coming from New York, it’s a very sad thing to witness, but we have to open up our states, totally open them. They’re keeping them closed because they want on November 3, they want to have the numbers as bad as possible. Based on the numbers that you’re seeing it’s not even affecting this but probably it would be better if these states were open. Forget about numbers though. The people that are inside those lockdowns, they’re suffering between depression, losing their jobs, drugs, alcohol, all of the different things that are happening to those people. That’s causing much more damage than the virus itself. Well look, I’d like people to go out and vote but if they want to sign something … You have solicited and unsolicited ballots –In the country. They’re going to send out 80 million unsolicited. In other words people that don’t even know what a ballot is, all of a sudden, here comes a ballot. Now we don’t even know if the people are going to get it. That’s my problem. Supposing they’re not sending them to Republican neighborhoods. Supposing they’re not sending them to wherever. Or supposing the people aren’t giving them back, or they go out and they harvest them. Somebody … It could be either way, but the Democrats seem to do that. I mean they played that game for a long time. Well, you might have to prosecute a lot more. The fact is they’re playing very dirty. 80 million ballots. We never had any number like that, anywhere close to that, and you’re going to see a mess on Election Night that’s going to be … It’s going to be legendary, and all they have to do is say, “Go out and vote,” or request a ballot. Get what’s called a solicited ballot or absentee, a lot of people use the word absentee. Get an absentee ballot where you request it, it comes to you, you vote and you send it back. That’s different, but they’re just sending out all over, they’re sending out 80 million ballots. How about signatures? They don’t even want to have signatures verified. They don’t want to have signatures verified. Where are they sending them? Who are they sending them to? Who’s sending them back? Who’s sending them back? It’s a very … It’s so unconstitutional, it’s so dishonest, and you have states that can’t even do small elections that way. Well we’re in courts, in many, many courts right now and hopefully the courts are going to decide because if they don’t you’re going to have one hell of a mess on Election Night. That's right. Every problem. We'll put them down very quickly if they do that. We have the right to do that, we have the power to do that if we want. Look, it’s called insurrection. We just send them in and we do it very easy. I mean it’s very easy. I’d rather not do that because there’s no reason for it but if we had to we’d do that and put it down within minutes, within minutes. Minneapolis, they were having problems. We sent in the National Guard within a half an hour. That was the end of the problem. It all went away. You look at Kenosha. Look at the problems they had. In fact the sheriffs there, the police chief, they’re all on my side, 100%. Law enforcement all over the country is on my side and I will say this. Look, we have … Even with the horrible things that are going on in New York and Chicago, all run by Democrats. Everything we’re talking about is run by Democrats. We’re not talking about one Republican place. It’s all run by Democrats. Even the police chiefs, they’re all quitting all over the country. Every single one, I think I saw 15 or 20, every single one of them is from a Democrat city. Look, before China sent us the plague, before the plague came in, we had the best crime numbers in history. When the plague came it changed things, let’s face it, it changed things, but all of the problems are in Democrat run cities. They’re badly run, the taxes are too much, they want to defund their police. Biden is all in that. He hasn’t still to this day used the term law and order. He’s afraid to use the term because he’s going to lose. He would lose the radical left supporters that he’s got if they even show up for him because there’s a question as to whether or not they’re going to show up, but they don’t want to talk about law and order. One other thing, you have a lot of people living in the suburbs, you know it well. You live in Westchester, you know it well. I ended a rule or regulation where low-income housing has been forced into the suburbs and this has been going on for a long time but especially so under Biden and Obama. I ended it, I terminated it. Not going to happen anymore unless I’m not here in which case they’re going to [inaudible 00:11:13] worse. So the suburbs are not going to have these projects forced into them. Now who in the suburbs is not going to vote for me? They’re going to make the projects bigger, better. They’re putting Cory Booker in charge. I mean one of the most liberal, the most liberal is Kamala, but Cory’s right there, and he’s going to be in charge of building projects in the suburbs. You’re going to destroy your suburbs. It’s already happening because you see what’s going on, you see what they’ve done. They take over the zoning and they force projects, projects. Really terrible situation. Well the suburbs are going to be next. Look, the suburbs, the people, these same protesters, but they’re not protesters, they’re anarchists, they’re agitators, and they’re rioters –They're people that in many cases are paid-And then their stupid kids. By people that we’re looking at right now. We’re looking at them right now. No, not yet, but you’re going to be finding out pretty soon. Look, they’re stupid people too, because they’ll be overthrown as soon as they get their wish. These people don’t respect them, they’re just using their money. These are super liberal people that have money and they’re helping these anarchists and their agitators and they’re dangerous … Did you see what happened over the weekend with the people walking up to a restaurant and grabbing the steak off –The plate and biting the steak and then dropping it down, two elderly people having dinner at a restaurant and they walk in and they take a steak and they take the potato and they eat it? Well in Kenosha they asked me in, and we did a job like nobody’s ever seen before. Then you’re not allowed to do it, unless you do insurrection in which case it’s just not big enough for insurrection. You don't need it. You don't-Oh I’d be willing to do it in a heartbeat if you needed it but we don’t need it. Our National Guard –Our National Guard is so good and so tough. By the way, police departments, in places that we’re talking about, Seattle, we were going into Seattle and they solved the problem the night before we got there. We were getting ready to go, they heard we were going in. Ted Wheeler’s a disaster. He’s a laughingstock. He went out to protest with the so-called agitators and they were going to destroy him. They were going to beat him up badly, he fortunately had security but they were going to beat him up badly. The man is a disaster. If he would say come into Portland, within a half an hour, the whole thing would be solved. The governor’s gotten closer. Look, what’s going on out there? I will tell you –The governor has gotten closer. I’ve spoken to the governor two days ago. They’re arresting a lot of people that we sent in the U.S. Marshals for the killer, the man that killed the young man on the streets. He shot him. I mean it was on television. Just cold-blooded killed him. He didn’t like his hat or he didn’t like something and it wasn’t a Trump hat. It was a lot, it was a religious hat, and he shot him, cold blood. Two and a half days went by and I put out when are you going to go get him? The U.S. Marshals went in to get him and in a short period of time, they ended in a gunfight. This guy was a violent criminal. The U.S. Marshals killed him and I will tell you something, that’s the way it has to be. There has to be retribution when you have crime like this. There can’t be guys standing up that want to fight, they want to fight. You can’t throw bricks at people. So what’s going to happen, and this is a shame, you’re going to have a backlash like you’ve never seen if these people don’t stop. Because you have very smart, very tough people that aren’t going to take it any more and once they say we’re not going to take it anymore, its going to end in a very vicious backlash and that’s a terrible thing.

"58","09-13-20","Thank you, thank you. Wow. Wow. Well, thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you. Great to be with you. And a very special, hello, Nevada. Hello, Nevada. We love [crosstalk 00:00:53], and I’m thrilled to be here with you in Henderson. Thousands of loyal, hard-working, great American patriots. And 51 days from now, we’re going to win Nevada, and we’re going to win four more years in the White House. And after we win four more years, we’ll ask for maybe another four or so. Well, thank you very much. Whenever I say that … Look at all that news back there, look at all that fake news. When I say that, their heads explode. Our movement is pro-jobs, pro-worker, pro-police, and 100% pro-American. As we begin tonight, our thoughts are with the two sheriff’s deputies in Los Angeles who were fighting for their lives when a vicious criminal walked up to their vehicle and shot them at point blank range. Tonight, we send our love and our support to their families, and we pray to God for their recovery. The radical left in America is waging open war on law enforcement. Hundreds of officers nationwide have been injured in left-wing riots and mobs. You see it, you see it all the time. Please, sit down. Please, let’s have a little fun. We got plenty of time. I mean, here it is. I mean, what do we have? Football is boring as hell. It’s just not the same. Right? I don’t know. Used to be people would say, “Hey, could you keep it away from a football game?” Now they’re saying, “Could you possibly do it during the football game?” We have some free time. But during violent demonstrations in Las Vegas, a 29-year-old police officer, you know this very well, was deliberately shot in the head, leaving the young, brave officer paralyzed, yet, Sleepy Joe Biden and his supporters continue their dangerous war on the police. They’re putting the lives of our brave officers directly in harm’s way. At his convention, he never even mentioned the words, “law and order”, never mentioned them once. Now, he’s all of a sudden, his polls are dropping like a rock, and he’s starting to say, “But we need law and order.” And then he goes back into the basement for four days. What happens to this guy? I know what happens to him. He’s shot. That’s what happened to him. Every once in a while, the great Dana White … Does anybody know Dana White? He’s got some champions with him tonight. He’s here. I got to introduce him. But every once in a while, I’ll ask him, “What happened to that guy?” He said, “Sir, he’s been shot for the last … long time.” Should have left a long time ago. That’s Joe Biden. Joe Biden, he’s shot, and everybody knows it. And you know what? They ought to be ashamed, because they do interviews with him, they give him the questions, and they let him read the answer from a teleprompter, and that’s the fake news. It is. How about the other day? Could you move that a little bit closer. See these things? Move it a little bit. I must tell you at great peril, I used them seldom, but those are the times we have the best fun too, I will say. And that’s actually when we learn the most. For the entire summer, Biden was silent as left-wing mobs assaulted police officers. When Biden’s far-left supporters set fire to police cars and precinct stations, court houses, Joe Biden called them peaceful protestors. Right? They call them peaceful protestors. And when we go to these radical-left place that are having problems, because everyone … look at the top-10. You go back … go top-20, top-30. Take a look. Democrat-run, radical left-wing, Democrat, usually run. Not Republican-run, Democrat-run. And we go back, and we take a look. We want to give them help. They don’t want help. But when they do ask for help, and when they do, we go in. Like Minneapolis, the National Guard went in, took 35 minutes to quell a situation that went on for two weeks. They knew we were going in to Seattle. We told them, “We’re going in tomorrow morning.” And so, they sent them in. They didn’t want that to happen, and we let the protestors know, or whatever you call them. They’re really anarchists, they’re not protestors. So we let the anarchists know that we were going in with approximately 10,000 very tough people, and they immediately raised their hands, and the Seattle police, who by the way, could do a great job if they were let to do their job, but they’re not, they’re not. And as you know, in Portland, the other day, we had to send in the US Marshalls. A man, who’s a bad guy, bad guy, shot somebody right in the middle of the street, who they say was a very fine young man. Shot him, killed him. Just shot him like … It was on television. Two-and-a-half days, nothing happened. I said, “What’s going on?” We sent in the US Marshalls. It was taken care of in 15 minutes. Okay? 15 minutes. When asked if he would cut police funding, Sleepy Joe said, “Absolutely, yes, I would.” Now he’s trying to change his mind. You ever see a guy … He changed his mind on fracking. Okay? “There will be no fracking.” You know that? He went all throughout the debates. He doesn’t even know what fracking is, I guarantee you. He was told to say that by Bernie and the radical left and his vice president. By the way, how bad is she? She is the worst. We’re going to have a woman president some day. Not going to be her, not going to be her. And that’s no way to attain the office. We got in there because Sleepy Joe couldn’t handle it anymore. Joe is bad primetime. See, the reason I can talk so badly about him, because he did an ad, where he had me standing over the grave and the graves of our fallen heroes from many years ago, and they said … And nobody loves the military more. Look what I’ve done for them, $2.5 trillion. And in the ad, they have me saying horrible things in front of other people. Nobody would have put up with that. It’s called disinformation. They make up a total lie, they put it out, then they do ads. So once he did that, I said, “Now, really, look, it’s okay. It’s okay, because now the gloves are off.” I can say that this man is totally unfit to be president. Up here, he’s totally unfit. He can’t be your president. I’ve gotten to know President Xi of China. I’ve gotten to know President Putin of Russia. And by the way, getting along with them is good. Although China, I must tell you, got a real problem with China. What they did with us, we can never forget that. We made a great trade deal. The ink wasn’t dry when the plague came in from China. They stopped it from going into China, but they didn’t stop it from going into our country, Europe and the rest of the world. Okay? They could have done that. But you see, I deal with all of these people, and they don’t have the kind of mental problem that Sleepy Joe has. They’re very sharp. Kim Jong-un. Kim Jong-un doesn’t know about the problems that Joe has. We need very sharp people. I’m sorry. Joe is not qualified for this position. Joe calls for abolishing cash bail and closing your prisons. He wants to close prisons, and he even called law enforcement the enemy recently. You saw that? The enemy, until his polls started dropping. Then all of a sudden, he said, “No, we love law enforcement.” I think I’ve gotten every major law enforcement group in the country, right? You saw recently, I got New York’s finest. And they are New York’s finest, but they’re not allowed to do their job. They’re not allowed. We have a radical left mayor who has no clue. He has no clue what’s happening to that poor city. I love that city. What’s happening to that city. 300% up. Look, 300% in certain very bad crimes, New York. There’s no reason for this, and we have the greatest police. They’re great. New York’s finest, they endorsed me. Chicago, Fraternal Order of Police. Chicago endorsed me, Oklahoma endorsed me, Texas endorsed me, Florida endorsed me. Every place endorsed me. And if you think it’s easy for New York and Chicago and these different places … Ohio endorsed me. If you think it’s easy for these guys. They never endorse. New York, they said they cannot remember ever having endorsed a presidential candidate. They endorsed me, and they’re against their radical left culture that’s destroying the city. So I was very honored. But how about Chicago? Do you think it’s easy for these great police in Chicago to endorse me? It’s not easy, but they felt that they had an obligation to do it. So it just happened. I’m just very honored by it. And Biden’s anti-police crusade must stop. It’s got to stop, it’s got to stop now. Furthermore, the corporations, these poor, stupid people that run the … They got paid a lot of money. They’re weak, ineffective people, let’s face it. They’re funding anti-police organizations and other organizations that are … It’s so embarrassing. And I don’t mean for a little. They gave $100 million and 250 … You’re talking about serious money. You’re talking about serious money, and that money is not used for good reasons. And these stupid corporations … and they’ll be the first to go if the radical left ever took … They’d throw those guys out like they were nothing. If they were lucky, they’d just be thrown out. It would probably be a lot rougher than that. These people don’t know what they’re getting into. But instead of giving money, they should give money to the families of the crime victims and the fallen officers. That’s what they should do. So in the Republican Party, we know that police officers are not villains, but the heroes who risk their lives to keep us safe. And they guard … The thing that’s incredible … I know so many police, they’re so good, one bad apple, and they’re on for months. One bad apple, they go on for months. The thousands and tens of thousands of good things, nobody talks about it. These are great people that have done a great job, and we have to support our law enforcement. So Biden wants to appease the domestic terrorists, and my plan is to arrest domestic terrorists. Okay? And we also believe that if you murder a police officer, you should receive the death penalty, and that’s something that’s very important. And you saw a video of that animal that went up to the car. Did everybody see that? This animal goes up to the car. Two unsuspecting, fine people. There was [inaudible 00:13:42] fine people. I mean, they’re in very grave condition, as you know. Fine people. He’s an animal, and I called him an animal, and I was criticized by people, calling him an animal. They said he’s a human being. He’s not a human being. He’s an animal. He’s not a human being. Joe Biden opposes the death penalty even for cops who … I mean, look, you have to see, even for these cop killers who go around, the predators, they murder children. People like the Boston bomber. He opposes the death penalty for the Boston bomber. He wants to give prisoners a vote. He wants to have the Boston bomber be able to vote. I don’t think so. I don’t think so. I don’t think so. You know who’s thought of that? Bernie Sanders, Crazy Bernie. He wants to have … Crazy Bernie, he says, “No, no, they have to vote.” So they asked him, “Well, does that mean every … ” That means everybody that’s in prisons should be entitled to a vote, right? So they actually said, “Well, what about the Boston bomber? Should he entitled?” And Bernie goes, “Yeah, he should be entitled.” Bernie is crazy. But the fact is, that we got a lot of Bernie votes four years ago, because Bernie’s right about one thing, trade. Because all of these countries, friend and foe, they ripoff the United States. We have made so many great trade deals, and you see it, USMCA. We got rid of NAFTA. So many. But Biden is too weak to be president, and he’s not a smart person. And by the way, he wasn’t smart 25 years ago. Everybody knew it. Now we don’t even have to discuss the matter. But I was going to say, when he put that ad up, we told him to take it down. When he put that ad up, that dishonored our fallen heroes. They are great, great heroes of mine, of yours, of everybody’s. I know really bad people. No bad person, the worst person I know, I know some beauties from New York. I know some developers in New York actually. Nobody would say what they said. They made it up. It was a made up statement, and they put it up in the form an ad, from a third-rate magazine, who’s best friend is Obama, who, by the way, got caught spying on my campaign. He got caught. We caught him cold. We have him cold. Now let’s see what happens. Now the Republicans, it’s interesting, we have much better policy, but the Republicans, they don’t fight like Colby. You know who Colby is. You’re going to say hello to Colby. They don’t fight like Colby. They don’t fight to win. Better policy, but they don’t have that vicious streak. If this were reversed, they would be in jail for two years already, and it would be for a 50-year term for treason. That’s what it would be. Okay? But Biden’s too scared to stand up to the crazy socialists and never will. He’ll never have the strength, and he’s going downhill fast. It’s going to be very interesting. And I called for a drug test, because you know what? I want a drug test, because we don’t want to have a situation like we could have with this guy. I watched him in debates with other 24 lunatics, and he was so bad. No, he was so bad. Maybe he’ll win because they don’t like me, they don’t like my personality. But I hate to say it, I’m what you need. I’m what you need. But if Biden ever did win, he would surrender your country to the mob. You know that. And he will have nothing to do with it. It’s not him. I mean, he’s being … He’s going to be pushed around. And she’s, by the way, just so you know what you’re going to get. She’s considered far more liberal than Bernie Sanders. How about that? That’s what you’re going to have. I don’t think your state is into that. Unlike Biden, I’ll always stand with the heroes of law enforcement. And I’m deeply honored to have gotten all of those endorsements. That to me is a really big deal. That to me is really a big deal. And I just want to thank all of them, including the National Troopers Association and Coalition just came in. We also received the endorsement, total and complete endorsement from the Public Safety Alliance of Nevada, and the Las Vegas Police Protective Association from Nevada. And I want to thank for that, Steve Grammar, who’s with us tonight. Where’s Steve? Was Steve here? Steve, thank you. Thank you. That’s a big deal. Make sure they get out and vote, Steve, because they’re playing around with the ballots. Okay? You know your governor. So we had many sites, by the way, all exterior sites, all outside. Today, you’ll hear these phoneys back there. Well, look at that. Now today you’re going to hear them. They’ll say, “Oh, it was in …” Well, the reason it was, we had five sites, all outside sites, like last night. Tremendous room. And a great gentleman who owns this building said, “You know what? What they’re doing is really unfair. You can use my building, Don. I want to thank you, Don.” I want to thank you. This is the most important election in the history of our country. At no time before has there been a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies, two agendas for the future. Joe Biden has spent the last 47 years selling out America. Look at what he’s done. Everything he’s done was wrong. He always voted the wrong way. Even his secretary of defense, his secretary of state, they said he always voted the wrong way. He was off shoring your jobs, throwing open your borders, depleting our military, and sacrificing your children’s future to China and other faraway lands. I’ve spent the last four … He says … Only in Nevada can you have … I would never say it. What did you say? Okay. This way I can’t get in trouble. I’ve spent the last four years bringing our jobs back to America, securing our borders, rebuilding our military, and standing up to China like no other president has ever done. If Biden wins, China wins. If Biden wins, the mob wins. If Biden wins the rioters and anarchists, and …Look, you see what’s going on. The arsonists and flag burners. How about the flag burning? I would love to have a law … This is so sad what’s going on. When I see the American flag burn, I get so angry. I get so angry. I would love to have a law. It has to go through a big process. You burn the flag, you go to jail for one year. I would love to see it. I would love to see it. I would love to see it. I would love to see it. If I were a Congressman or Senator, I’d be in there with that one. You know, they’ll say, “Oh, freedom of speech.” That’s not freedom of speech. You burn the flag, you should go to jail for one year. I really mean that. They’ll say, “Oh, it’s horrible. He’s against free speech.” No, no, we’re not. We’re not against free speech. But I’m running for reelection to bring back the tremendous prosperity that we enjoyed before the plague came in, and it’s happening very fast. And I’m running for your state. I love this state. You know, I put a lot of money in this state and it’s been a great investment. And we want to keep this state strong. Not for that reason, by the way, for other reasons, because this is a great place. You have a governor right now who’s a political hack. We want to put violent criminals behind bars. And tell you governor to open up your state, by the way. Open up your state. You know, just so you know, these shutdowns, we did the right thing. We had the greatest economy in the history of the world. They came in, they … We were all seeing what was happening. We closed up. I mean, you know, you’re presiding over the greatest economy in history and a group of very smart people walk in and say, “Sir, we have to close it.” And we did the right thing. We closed it. Well, actually he didn’t think we should close it yet. But later on, he said, “We did the right thing.” We closed it. We closed it. We saved millions of lives. If we wouldn’t have closed it, we would’ve been talking two and a half or three million. We’re at 180. It’s far too much. But we would have been talking about … It would’ve been unacceptable, unsustainable. It would’ve been so bad. Think of it. We’re at 180,000. Other countries are doing terribly. Did you see the statistics of us compared to other countries? Us compared to Europe? We have done an incredible job. We get absolutely no credit for the job we’ve done. And I don’t want it myself, but I want it for the admirals and the generals and Mike Pence. And Joe Biden was against it. Remember? He was totally against closing. He said, “Oh, he’s xenophobic.” I’m xenophobic? I wanted it closed and nobody else did. At that time, nobody else did. I was way early. You know, they say, “He didn’t act fast.” I was months early. Nancy Pelosi was a month and a half later saying, “Come to Chinatown. Let’s come to Chinatown.” And Sleepy Joe was totally … He thought what I was doing was terrible. Then all of a sudden, now I see him saying, “He should have closed it earlier.” This guy … You know, the great thing about the age in which we live? It’s all down in tape. It’s all down. I got a reel on him. We call it Biden’s Best. You got to hear this. But we want to ensure the future of America, not the future of China and other countries, because if we win, America wins, and it’s all about America first. You’ve had presidents, they never put America first. They didn’t put America first. They didn’t take care of our country, but we’re taking care of our country. Now, Joe Biden cannot lead our country because he really doesn’t believe, truly, in our country. But I think that’s a very strong statement. I don’t think he has a clue. I’ll be honest. The people that push him around don’t believe in our country, because he agreed to a manifesto with crazy Bernie, right? It’s called the manifesto. You know why it’s called the manifesto? Because this is beyond socialism. This is a word that starts with a C, not and S. That’s where they’re coming from. That’s where they’re coming from. At Biden’s convention they decried America wicked. And they were saying it’s wicked sinful. It’s destined for a fate of doom and despair. That was, by the way, that was the most depressing convention. We had a great convention. We had a great convention. They actually said that America wasn’t great. They actually said that America was never great. You know who said that? Cuomo, the governor of New York, said America wasn’t great. I don’t know if he’s going to get away with that one. That’s going to haunt him. That’s going to haunt him. America wasn’t great. Him and his brother, Fredo. You ever watch Fredo? His ratings aren’t very good, so you probably don’t. But we know the truth. America’s the most exceptional nation on Earth. And our destiny is blessed by God. We love this nation with all of our heart and soul, and we will always take care of our nation. You know, we have a little expression, “Make America Great Again.” That’s what’s happened. And you know, we had it done. Now I say, “Make America Great Again, Again.” Comma. I go comma again. And that’s what we’re doing at a record clip. They’ve never had a clip like this with the jobs and everything else. You see the numbers. On November 3rd, Nevada will decide whether we will quickly return to record prosperity, and we’re doing it. We’re going to have a tremendous year next year. Or whether we’ll allow Joe Biden and the group of handlers to impose a $4 trillion tax hike, ban American energy, destroy our suburbs, demolish our second amendment, and indoctrinate your children with a poisonous anti-American lie. Yeah. Get him out of here, would you please? Under my leadership we built the greatest economy in the world. He’s going home to mom. And now we’re doing it again. We’re developing a vaccine in record time. The other administration would have been years, and we’re almost there. It’s going to be announced very soon. We’ll be ready before the end of the year. And we will very easily defeat the China virus. That’s what’s happening. And we’re already making that turn. We’re making that round beautiful last turn, but it should have never happened. China should have never let that happen. They should have stopped it in China. Under my administration, before the virus, we quickly achieved the lowest unemployment rate in Nevada’s history. And we’ll soon be there again. You see what’s happening. A guy like Biden would totally eradicate Nevada’s economy. He would make it impossible for you to compete. And he’s already said if the doctor suggested, he would shut down the country again. We’re not shutting down our country. A shutdown we’ll destroy the lives and dreams of tens of millions of American. Look the Americans, you know, on the other side if you look at these shutdowns, and you’re living through it right now. You know, there aren’t many states that are shut down. They’re all Democrats. North Carolina, your state. But North Carolina, we’re not … You take a look at North Carolina. Pennsylvania shut down. Every one of them that are shut down are doing not well. They’re not doing well. And they all have Democrat governors. And you know, when you look at the suicide rates, when you look at all of the suicide, all of the domestic violence, the drugs, all of the problems, we can’t have it. We can’t have it. Open up your state. You got to open up your state. It’s all political. It’s all political. It’s all political. On November 4th, they’ll announce, “We’re going to open up the states.” They’re only doing it to affect your November 3rd great election. Most important election. Biden will always do whatever the radical left demands. And if elected, his radical supporters won’t just be causing mayhem on the streets. They’ll be running the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security. And by the way, the United States Supreme Court. And we will have a very different country. You know, the next president probably will have anywhere one, two, three, or four Supreme Court justices. If you want your second amendment, if you want life, if you want so many other things, even having to do with your military, even having to do with your vets, if you want things, if you want, you’ve got to have the court. Because they’ll last for 25, 30, 40 years. They’re put on as young people and they stay a long time. Our country will never be the same. We’ll never be able to recover from it. So you got to get out on November 3rd or early voting. You got to get out and vote. And you could send your ballot, and then you have to check that your ballot’s counted because they might not count your ballot in this state. They may not count your ballot. But we’re looking to save and we’re going to save America. We’re not going to let that happen. So we’re joined tonight by two terrific congressional candidates that have been just incredible in the job they’ve done. You see it. I mean, you’ve seen it all the way. The job they’ve done in their campaign. They beat people that were very good, very talented, great politicians, and they won. Dan, where is he? Dan Rodimer. Dan Rodimer. Dan Rodimer. And we’re with you all the way, Dan. And Jim Marchant. Jim, thank you very much. Thank you, Jim. So we’re backing you all the way. You got to get them in. We will take back the House. You know why? Because people cannot stand Nancy Pelosi. They don’t like Nancy Pelosi. Even the woman that owns the beauty parlor turned her in. Can you believe that? Nancy Pelosi’s a customer. She turned her in. She thought it was disgraceful, but that’s what we’re dealing with, a bunch of phonies. But you guys, we have your back 100%. Michael, you’ll make sure, all right? I also want to introduce and thank … He’s done a fantastic job. Nevada Republican Party Chairman, Michael McDonald. And a friend of mine, and thank you, Michael. Your former Attorney General Adam Laxalt. And a person with tremendous spirit and personality to put it mildly. She’s tough, but she’s very kind. She’s a great person, Kimberly Guilfoyle. Thank you, Kimberly. Thank you. Thank you, Kimberly. The owner of the Chicago Cubs and he’s in first place, so he’s very happy, the RNC Finance Chairman, Todd Ricketts. Where is Todd? Todd, thank you. Great. Go win that pennant Todd. Win the pennant. One of the best people ever to work for me in government. He’s tough, he’s smart, he can be vicious, but he’s just fair more than anything else. But he is a talented guy with tremendous energy and tremendous brain power, Rick Grenell. Thank you, Rick. And here he is again, because they’re going to try and find out, “Man, what’s this guy manufacturing?” This is a manufacturing building. And outside, 25,000 to 30,000 people, everyone’s saying, “What the hell is he manufacturing?” Maybe he’s manufacturing Trump, I don’t know. He’s manufacturing something pretty good. Boy, they’re going to be giving you a lot, but again, Don, thank you very much, Don [inaudible 00:00:54]. Thank you Don. Thank you Don. Also, a Las Vegas legend, Rick Harrison. Rick, thank you Rick. You are a legend, aren’t you, huh? Great job you’ve done. Great job you’ve done. A friend of mine for a long time. Years ago, he was looking for a place. Can I tell this story just quickly, do you mind? He was looking for a place and they said, “Well, that sport’s never going to make it. It’s too violent.” They just don’t know how violent the American people are, do they? They never quite figured that out. “No.” They said, “No, it’ll never make it.” There’s nobody like this guy, I’m telling you. I always say it’s a great sport. Without him, I don’t know what they’d do. I don’t know if anything would make it… He could do anything. He is so smart, so tough, so cunning. He’s been a friend of mine for a long time, I’ve been a friend of his, but I gave him a place a long time ago. And all I know is, just like we have outside, we had lines. I said, “What the hell is going on here, Dana? This place is packed. We were packed. We had thousands of people that couldn’t get in, and I was so nice. I said, “Let’s do it again, Dana, please.” And we did it again and again and again, and it became the UFC and he sold it and has a big chunk of it, but he got $4 billion when he sold it. $4 billion. That’s not too bad. That’s not too bad, Dana. But he really is, he’s an incredible guy. And he also loves his fighters. He wants to take care of his fighters and he brought some of them along, the best. But I want to introduce Dana White. Dana, please stand up. And Dana brought along a few of his friends and these are not people you want to pick a fight with. Because under those beautiful suits, there are a lot of muscles, a lot of power, a lot of genius for fighting and for other things, but a lot of genius under those suits. A few members of the UFC community. Here’s a man, he used to walk into that ring and he still does, and he’s as good as there is in the world. Number one in the world. You don’t want to pick a fight with him at a bar. Let’s say you’d had a fight and you happen to meet Colby Covington. You say, “What’s your name?” And he said, “My name’s Colby Covington.” And the first time I saw Colby Covington, he walks into the ring. Now he wasn’t fighting, but he walked in with that same hat that you’re wearing. It said, “Keep America great.” It says, Make…” He doesn’t care. As long as it has Trump on in someplace, he doesn’t care. He doesn’t discriminate. But this was the same day that we had our conservative reporter beat to hell by that wise guy, who’s now in big trouble for doing what he did. And then he walks in wearing the hat, “Keep America great.” And he wears the hat and he’s going like this because this was a big story. You remember what they did to that guy? Conservative reporter, not a fighter. He wasn’t a fighter. And it was 10 people against one. Now, if we had 10 people against that one, those 10 people would be in serious trouble. They said, “What the hell?” But I’d like to introduce Colby Covington. Great fighter. Great, great fighter. Incredible. He is a great fighter. Three months ago, I saw him fight a guy. He looked like it would be impossible to beat. I never saw muscles. He had muscles on muscles on muscles. And Colby is a very fit guy and fantastic. But he didn’t look quite the same. It wasn’t even a contest. It went a few rounds. I couldn’t believe what you did. He took him apart so easily. It was like an easy day at the office. So you have to explain that to me someday, Colby, but we love you, man. You’re with us and where we are with you. Another great, great champion. Another great champion, Henry Cejudo, one of the best in the world. And Henry, please stand, please. Now, you won the championship twice, right Henry? Twice. He won it twice. Don’t mess with him. Don’t mess with him. And his brother, Alonzo, is here. Alonzo Cruz. Thank you very much, Alonzo. Thank you. Thank you. And Alonzo doesn’t mess with Henry, he learned that a long time ago. So one of the best fighters in the world, and he’s got a tremendous fight coming up against, I guess the number one rated pound for pound fighter, Justin Gaethje. Please stand up, Justin. Justin Gaethje, thank you. And you feel good about that fight? He said he’s going to knock him out. Well, we’re going to be watching. It’s right before the election, but I think I’m going to be watching, okay? I’ll be watching, you better believe it. That’s going to be an incredible fight. Good luck. Good luck, Justin. Great fighter. And also Ali Abdelaziz, right? Abdelaziz. Great guy. One of the best. Thank you very much. But these are great people that they have so many people at the UFC and they’ve been big fans of us. They love our country. They love our country. And we loved them and nobody like our Dana. Thank you Dana, very much. Great honor. Thank you, man. Tonight, we’re also praying for everyone throughout the West affected by the devastating wildfires. We want really forest management, we want forest management… My administration is closely coordinating with the state and local leaders, with the governor and we thank the more than 28,000 firefighters and first responders courageously braving the danger and their life, and I’m going there tomorrow. I’ll be going to California tomorrow. We have meetings with FEMA and all of the different people. It’ll be amazing to see. It’s like the biggest we’ve ever had. It’s crazy. It’s crazy what’s going on. Thousands and thousands and thousands of acres. It’s crazy. So we’re going to be there tomorrow. We’ll be with the governor. We’re also going to various other places. Washington also is in big trouble and Oregon. I spoke with the governor of Oregon and they’ve never had anything like it. And of course they also have a place called Portland and we will put that fire out. Just tell us to put it out, governor. That fire we’ll put out. That’s a much easier fire to put out. It would take us less than a half an hour. We’ve spent the last four years reversing the damage done by Joe Biden and all of the damage that him and his thought process has inflicted over a 47-year period. We passed record-setting tax cuts and record-setting regulation cuts. We achieved American energy independence. Nobody thought it was possible. When Biden pledged to abolish the production of American oil and shale and clean coal and natural gas, which is very clean, and he wanted to ban fracking, we said, “No, we’re not doing that. For 47 years, Biden crushed the dreams of American workers to enrich foreign countries. That’s what happened. Look, he says he’s going to change. He’s been there for 47 years and you know that he’s been there until three and a half years ago. So it’s not like, “Gee, he hasn’t done it for 20.” He was there recently. They didn’t do it. And you don’t change. And you always go back to the first statement. His first statement was anti- religion. His first statement was anti-fracking, anti-energy. His first statement was anti all of the things, but it was really anti-gun, anti-Second Amendment. He even put this whack job, he even put Beto O’Rourke, Beto. They said, “Beto is Spanish.” I said, “How does the Beto go with the O’Rourke?” They said, “Well, he wanted the Spanish vote, so his father calls him Beto.” What’s that? Does that sound a little bit phony? Because we had a poll today and Hispanics are at 52% for Trump and forty-something for Biden. Never happened before. Never happened before. They’ve never seen that before. I love the Hispanics. But the Democrats champion, NAFTA, TPP, the horrible South Korea deal, South Korea deal… Hillary Clinton, crooked Hillary, she said, “We will create 250,000 jobs.” I said all the time, “We will do this deal with South Korea, we will create 250,000,” and she was right, but they were created for South Korea not for us. We didn’t get anything. And we renegotiated it and he was there for China’s entry into the World Trade Organization. Earlier this year, I kept my promise to American workers when we ended the NAFTA nightmare and we signed the brand new U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement in [Dolores 00:11:12]. Great deal for us. That’s a great deal. By the way, our stock market is setting records, I hate to say, in the middle a pandemic. But hopefully, as we round that final turn on the pandemic, we’re setting records with the stock market. Your 401k’s are doing very well. Your stocks are doing very well. And you know what? If something would happen where he’d get in, and there’s a headwind, believe it or not, that stock market would be much higher, but there’s a headwind on the possibility, okay? Everything is a possibility. There’s a headwind. But I’ll tell you what, if he ever got in, you would have a market crash the likes of which this country has never seen before. Just remember it, just to remember it, because what they want to do is crazy, the Green New Deal, $100 trillion, the Green New Deal. That’s more money than we could make in a thousand years, a hundred trillion dollars. “We don’t like that building. The windows are too big.” What do you do? “Rip it down and build a new one.” “All good. That sounds good.” I saved the U.S. auto industry by withdrawing from the last administration’s job-killing catastrophe, the Trans-Pacific Partnership. And we’re building many auto plants, you know that, some here, but we’re building many auto plants in Michigan, many auto plants in Michigan. If we don’t win Michigan after all those auto plants, and I don’t know, but it’s been tough but we won it last time. And we’re showing a poll that just came out that we’re two points up in Michigan. That’s very good, that’s very good. I took the toughest ever action to stand up to China’s rapid theft of American jobs. Biden’s agenda is made in China, my agenda is made in the USA. That’s what it is. For the last four years, I’ve been delivering for our incredible Hispanic community, I’m fighting for school choice, safe neighborhoods, low taxes, low regulations on all Hispanic-owned small business, and they are great business people. And they understood that. They understood that, they understood it… And by the way, there’s nobody that knows our Southern border better than, I call them the Hispanics, I call them the Latino. I said, “What do you prefer?” It’s very interesting. Some say, “Call us Latino.” Others say, “Call us Hispanic.” Others say, “Call us whatever the hell you want. We love you, we love you.” But our Hispanic population knows our Southern border better than anybody else. And they don’t want criminals coming across. They want people to come across, but they want them to come across legally. And we have the strongest Southern border now that we’ve ever had. The Democrats and Biden would be a disaster for Hispanic Americans. He’s pledged to wage attacks on Catholic organizations like the Little Sisters of the Poor. They’re fighting him. He supports taxpayer-funded extreme late-term abortion. Extreme late-term. He would allow left-wing anarchies to burn down your businesses. He would hand over your jobs to China, and your country to the socialists and beyond the socialists. The Democrat Party also continues to attack our incredible border agents, more than half of whom happen to be Hispanic Americans. And they’re great. And I want to thank not only law enforcement, but a big part of law enforcement, the Border Patrol and the ICE agents, they’re incredible. The ICE agents, Dana could sign some of them up, the ICE agents, they go into like a pack. They go at a pack. They go into a pack of MS-13 fighters. These are criminals and they do it like it’s routine. You don’t want that job. I don’t see any of the people, male or female sitting in this audience, that wants that job, ICE. They take out thousands and thousands of MS-13 killers a year and bring them the hell back out of our country. All around our country, our communities are protected by Hispanic American heroes in law enforcement, and they deserve unwavering gratitude. I want to just thank you all, I want to thank you all. With us tonight are members of the National Border Patrol Council and they are great friends of us. I want to just thank them. The official union of our nation’s incredible border patrol agents. And you know what? They’re not supposed to do it, but they did it anyway, they endorsed me. I want to thank Brandon Judd, who’s here, and Art Del Cueto. Art. Where’s Brandon, where is my Brandon? Where is Brandon? Look at these guys. Look, they’re ready. They’re ready to fight. Hey Brandon, Art, pick out your toughest guy, I want to see whether or not he can take Colby in a fight. Don’t do it. Thank you very much. Thanks fellas. We appreciate it very much. Thanks. Great job too. Great job. My administration has achieved the most secure border in American history. We ended catch and release. We stopped asylum fraud. We’ve deported 20,000 gang members and over half a million criminal aliens. We built over 320 miles, as of today, border wall and we’re adding 10 new miles every single week. We’re doing about 10 miles a week and we’ll be finished with the wall very shortly. And you think, “That was an easy one.” That was not an easy one. We were fought. Two things, and I say it, two things that never get old. Remember the Democrats are saying, “A wall won’t work.” “Really? Tell me about it.” Wall works. That’s one of the reasons our numbers are so good, but two things that will never get old, never, you know what they are? A wall and a wheel. A wall and a wheel. It’ll never get old. A wall. I see so many things and I see all these businesses, computers, you come up with a new chip, you come up with a new computer, you come up with a new laptop. Three weeks later, you buy it, three weeks later, it’s obsolete. But a wall will never be obsolete, and a wheel will never be obsolete. You come back in a thousand years, a wall and a wheel. Thanks to our powerful new security measures, we’ve doubled the amount of meth seized at the border over the last year, we’ve doubled. We invested $2.5 trillion in the US military and launched the first new branch of the US Armed Forces in 75 years, the Space Force. We passed VA Choice and VA Accountability. And I’ve accomplished more in 47 months than Joe Biden did in 47 years. That’s true. That’s true. I withdrew from the last administration’s disastrous Iran nuclear deal. So good for Israel. So good that we did that. They paid $150 billion, 1.8 billion in cash. I think Dana White could have made a slightly better deal than that. You know what we got for it? Nothing. We got nothing. We killed the founder and leader of ISIS. al-Baghdadi we eliminated the number one terrorist in the world. And we’re talking over a 50 year period. Number one in the world, the mass murder of American troops and many other people throughout the world, Qasem Soleimani is dead. I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. I recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, and we’ve achieved the two historic peace deals in the Middle East in just the last month, two, two. Over 75 years, they did two. We did two in a month. And many other countries are coming in, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain have both agreed to normalize relations with Israel. Nobody thought this was possible. In fact, you didn’t hear it because they don’t report this. They just don’t want to report it, but they nominated your President twice last week on two different subjects for a Nobel Prize. But the fake news media didn’t cover it, so that’s it. Biden got it. Remember… Well, okay. Remember when our great President, right? Barack Hussein Obama, he got it. Right? Like immediately. And they said, “Why did you get it?” And he was unable to explain, do you remember? “Why did you get it?” Because it was like, he just became President, and they said, “We’re going to nominate Barack Hussein Obama for the Nobel Peace award, right? And what happened? And then Biden said, “What about me?” They said, “Who the hell is he? This guy, what the hell has he done?” But it’s true. Obama got it for no reason whatsoever. Rick, you know that? No reason whatsoever. Joe Biden brought you only endless wars, I’m bringing you peace and I’m bringing our troops back home. They’re all coming back. Endless wars. Biden voted for the Iraq war. He opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden. He opposed the killing of Soleimani. He oversaw the rise of ISIS and he cheered the rise of China as a positive development for America and the world. When I banned China from coming in, highly infected, he said it was hysterical and xenophobic. If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died just by that one move alone. When the-Thank you. I agree, actually, but I don’t think I’m allowed to say it. When the virus arrived, we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II, we’re delivering life-saving therapies, we’ve achieved among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country, anywhere in the world. You don’t hear this. Europe’s excess mortality rate is 24% higher than the US, and despite their very punitive lockdowns, they’re once again, seeing very large spikes in cases, unfortunately. The United States has experienced the smallest contraction of any major Western nation and the fastest recovery by far. Who’s going to do well? And there’s a reason for it. Through our historic relief programs, we’ve saved more than half a million Nevada jobs and over 42,000 Nevada businesses, we’ve saved 42,000 of your businesses. Biden would terminate this comeback and put your families in great danger. He would reimpose the federal regulations, destroy your Social Security, destroy [inaudible 00:59:59]. And he’s looking at doing all of this stuff. He will destroy protections for preexisting conditions and decimate your 401(k)s, your retirement system, your stocks, he’ll establish a national sanctuary city policy for criminal illegal aliens. He wants to cut your vet facilities in half, go to socialized healthcare and end 180 million Americans’ private healthcare plans, which they love. Biden pledges to oppose school choice, and he stated that if elected, charter schools are gone. And charter schools have been great. In a second term, I’ll provide school choice to every parent in America. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, a limitless future for all Americans. It’s really a vote for the American dream. That’s what it is. It’s the American dream versus the American nightmare. Instead of letting Washington change us, despite all that we’ve been through, we are changing Washington. So in concluding, this wonderful afternoon, and again, Don, thank you very much, but in concluding, this wonderful afternoon, and if the governor comes after you, which he shouldn’t be doing, I’ll be with you all the way. I’ll be with you all the way. Don’t worry about a thing. Over the next four years, we’ll be making America into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we’ll end our reliance on China once and for all. We will make our medical supplies right here in the United States. We will rapidly return to full employment, soaring economies, and record prosperity. We will expand Opportunity Zones, and we will continue cutting taxes and regulations at a level that nobody has ever seen before. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, surge federal prosecutors into high crime communities. And we’ll be watching the ballots very closely also, by the way. And we will ban sanctuary cities. We will appoint prosecutors, judges, and justices who believe in enforcing the law, not in enforcing their own agenda. We will ensure equal justice for citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed. We will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens, and we will keep America out of these endless ridiculous foreign wars, all coming back. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength, two and a half trillion dollars, have the strongest military we’ve ever had, beautiful brand new equipment. When I took it over, it was totally depleted, our military. We have the greatest equipment that any military has ever even conceived of, things that people have no idea what we have, and let’s keep it that way. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency already signed, further reduce health insurance premiums, and the cost of prescription drugs will be dropping like a rock very soon. The drug companies do not like me too much. It’s a favored nations clause I signed. We will strongly protect Medicare, and your Social Security will be totally secure. And we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions. America will land the first woman on the moon, and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. When I took over, NASA was a shell of itself. It was closed, they had grass growing in the runways, grass growing in the runways. Now it’s the number one space center in the world by far. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. We will live by the timeless words of our national motto, In God we trust, and we’re going to keep it that way. For years, you had a President who apologized for America. Now you have a President who is standing up for America and standing up for your state, Nevada. So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, and on November 3rd or sooner, get out and vote. From Carson City to Elko, from Las Vegas to Reno, from Minden to right here in Henderson, we stand on the shoulders of red-blooded American patriots who poured out their heart, sweat, and soul to secure our liberty and defend our great freedom. Nevada was founded by pioneers and prospectors, miners and cowboys, innovators and trailblazers who tamed the frontier, raised up the mighty Hoover Dam, transformed a sprawling desert into a shining oasis and inspired the world with the brilliant lights of the Vegas Strip. Our American ancestors made this into the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the earth, and we are going to make it greater than ever before. That’s what we’re doing. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people, with your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are, you know the story, going to keep on working, going to keep on fighting, and going to, like these guys, keep on winning, winning, winning. You hear that, Colby? You hear that, Justin? Okay? He’s fighting a tough customer, but I don’t know. I think maybe, I’m in Vegas, I’ll have to place… Is the President allowed to place a bet? I don’t know. They’ll say, “The President of the United States just placed two bets, Justin and Colby.” I don’t know. I don’t know, but they are great. That’d be easy money. Well, maybe not that easy. I don’t know if it’s that easy. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God, and together with the incredible people of Nevada, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you.

"59","09-14-20","The fake news, they said that this is supposed to be a roundtable, but it looks like a rally, but it is a rally because we love each other. No, it is a roundtable and we’re here to really listen. We’re here to discuss the Latinos and the Hispanic Americans. I want to say you have a great Governor. He has been fantastic. Thank you. I love you, too. And we’re really doing well. The country is doing numbers that… You will see. Next year is going to be, you know, you had your greatest year ever, Doug, last year, the best year you ever had. Then we had to close it up. We had to stop and we saved millions of lives by doing it. We saved millions of lives. And then we restarted and now we’ve set all kinds of records and we’re setting records. And I think next year you’re going to have a fantastic year. It’s going to be great. We’re cutting taxes even further. And we’re going to have big growth. A lot of good things happening. But I’m thrilled to be back in Arizona with the… Thank you. By the way, I just looked. I see Artie over here. You’ve done a great job. How’s Albert? Is he good? He’s a good guy. Good job, Artie. So it’s really great to be back. This is good. You know, this is what the polls are all saying too. As a Republican, Republicans don’t do as well as perhaps they should. And probably some shouldn’t do very well, but the polls came out and were leading sleepy Joe by a lot. And so it’s a great honor to be here. But we’re here to discuss my administration’s unwavering devotion to Hispanic American communities, Hispanic Americans embody the American dream and they are great business people like this guy right here. They’re great business people. Great, great business people. I know that because I’ve had to compete with them. They’re not easy to compete with. I want to say that. Hispanic Americans strengthen our nation beyond description. You protect our nation as brave members of the military and as members of law enforcement, great, great members of law enforcement. You uplift the communities and promote our shared values of faith and family, community, hard work and patriotism. You’re an amazing group of people. And I love you and we’re taking care of you and I’m never letting you down. You’ll never let you down. We’re glad to be joined by your fantastic Governor, Doug Ducey. He’s done a fantastic job. You’ve done a great job. He really has. It's been incredible. So, and thank you, Doug. Also, thanks to Arizona Republican Chairwoman, Kelli Ward. How are we doing, Kelli, by the way? Thanks, Kelli. Arizona State Representative T.J. Shope. Thank you very much. Thanks, T.J. Arizona Corporation Commissioner Leah Marquez Peterson. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you. Sergeant Jimmy Chavez of the National Troopers Coalition. Sergeant, thank you. We have the law enforcement from all over the country. Just got Florida, all the sheriffs, all the law enforcement, Ohio, Texas, everywhere, New York. We got New York’s finest. They said they’ve never endorsed before, but they’re endorsing this year. That took a little courage, too, because they’re in very unfriendly territory politically. But New York did and we just got Chicago. Can you believe that? With that wonderful, wonderful mayor. We also have a man that I have a lot of respect. I like baseball. I’ve always liked baseball and he’s done a fantastic job. Arte Moreno, the owner of the Los Angeles Angels. Doing a fantastic job. How is Albert Pujols doing? Good. I think he’s great. Huh? Good. And you have a Mike Trout. So is he as good as they say? They say he’s the best player. He said he’s better. He’s better. Right? But they say is the best player in baseball. That’s great. That’s very good. Thanks, Arte. Congratulations on your success, too. Great job. Also with us are two wonderful Arizona Republican nominees for Congress, Tiffany Shedd and Brandon Martin. Thanks, Tiffany. Good luck. Good luck Thank you, Brendon. And you have my complete endorsement, you know that. Complete and total, as they say, complete and total, okay? And we’ll be out working with you. We’ll be helping you a lot. I hear both of you are doing really well. Very important. Doug is working hard on that. Thank you very much. Joe Biden has spent 47 years selling out the Hispanic American community, sending your jobs to China, raising your taxes, surging regulations. I don’t know. He doesn’t sound too good to me. He’s coming up once every three, four days. I’ve been in every state. I’ve been in so many states the last few days. Yeah. Well you need a lot of energy to do this job properly. You can’t be sitting in your basement for four days and come out. No, and then he comes out and I like Delaware. I think Delaware is a good place, but you got to leave it on occasion, you know. I mean, he comes up. And remember, they say that his home state is Pennsylvania. No, no, no. He left Pennsylvania when he was young. It’s not his fault. Hiss father left, okay, and his mother. They left, but they left Pennsylvania when he was very young. And we just had a great ruling. Doug and I were talking. Just literally minutes ago, a federal judge, a very prominent, a very respected federal judge came out and ruled that they can’t shut the state down any longer. It’s too much. They can’t do it. He said it was unconstitutional and it was a great ruling. And we hope that’s going to happen in North Carolina. We hope that it’s going to happen in North Carolina. We hope it’s going to happen in Michigan too, because it’s just totally shut down. Well, you know what’s going to happen. On November 4th, they’ll open up everything. They’re just doing it. on November 4th, they’ll announce everything’s open now. You know, we were only kidding. The fact is that November 4th, you’re going to see it’s going to all open up. It’s going to all open up. It’s politics. So if you know, and as Hispanic Americans, you know better than anybody, we implemented historic tax cuts and regulation cuts, the biggest in the history of our country. And we built opportunity zones that have really benefited your state and a lot of other states. And it’s been great for everybody, really, African Americans. And if you look at the African American, what they’ve done and how that’s benefited them, was I was helped by Tim Scott of South Carolina. And he’s a fantastic Senator. And he came in the idea of the opportunity zone, but for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, and really everybody, it’s been a tremendous success. Before the China virus came in, we achieved the lowest Hispanic American unemployment rate ever recorded ever. Not even close. Over 600,000 Hispanic Americans were lifted out of poverty in that short period of time. That’s a record. All records, Hispanic American ownership, home ownership reached an all time high. And that includes Arte’s home. Okay? That includes the home. Okay. That must be a nice home. I want to see that home. But it’s the highest home ownership ever in the history of our country for Hispanic Americans. We built the greatest economy in history and now we’re doing it again. So it’s called make America great again. And I say, make America great again and again. Again and again. And we added, as you’ve probably heard, we added 3.3 million jobs for Hispanic Americans in the last four months. That’s a record. So we’re coming back very, very strong. I call it the super V. In July, I launched the White House Hispanic Prosperity Initiative to improve access to education and economic development and opportunity for all Hispanic Americans. It’s been a very big success. We have great people on the board. And we have that Biden would, as you know, terminate this recovery because if a doctor said, “Let’s shut it down,” we have all these records. We have retail sales records, everything. He said he’d shut it down. Can’t shut it down. Peaceful protesters. Have you seen his peaceful protesters? These are not. They’ll rip down your community. Many of these are Hispanic, American, small businesses, stores, shops, and they rip them down and they call it peaceful protesting. You see some of these reporters on television, they’re saying, “Yes, this has been a peaceful protest.” And over his shoulder, it’s a pretty famous clip. The entire city is burning down. And these are all Democrat mayors, super liberal usually, but Democrat mayors and governors. Republicans are doing very well. Republican cities and states are doing incredibly well. We’re at records. We have been at records. We will be at records and we don’t have anything like this. Nobody’s ever seen anything like this. And we’ve sent the National Guard into Minneapolis and we ended it after a week and a half. They should have called it sooner. We would solve the problem in Portland in I say less than a half an hour. It would be solved. But they don’t want to call us. They don’t want to call us in. Every place we’ve gone, we solve it immediately. Seattle is an example. They took over a piece of the city and we said, “What are you doing?” And we complained, complained. We said, “That’s okay. We have to go in because we’re supposed to wait. We’re going in. And we’re going in tomorrow.” And we informed them we’re going in. As soon as we did that, they had people go in and these wise guys gave up, those so-called protesters. They gave up. They’re anarchists. They’re not protesters. They’re agitators and they’re anarchists. So, you see what happens with the anti-police rhetoric from that whole group of Democrats and their supporters. They’re endangering our law enforcement. We love our law enforcement. Many, many of the law enforcement are Hispanic Americans, as you know. Biden is not a strong person, never was a strong person. In prime time he wasn’t any good. Let’s face it. And this is not prime time for him. This is not prime time. But he’ll surrender your entire country to the radical left. And that’s all they’re doing is using him. He has no clue. So we will take this to a whole different level. What we’re doing is taking it to a whole different level. We don’t want to have a socialist country. Some of you came from parts of the world where it’s socialist or worse. You know, it’s called the C word, right? The C word. Because I think in many cases, these people are talking even beyond socialism and we’re not going to let that happen. We’re not going to let the rule of law really just be ruled by the mob. We’re going to do it. We’re going to do it properly. We’re going to do it the way we’re doing it. And again, remember the top 10 are all Democrat. And then you go into the top 25 and you take a look at that. It’s the same thing. It’s all a Democrat problem. Whether it’s New York, where crime is through the roof, it’s gone up in some cases, 150 to 300%, not even recognizable. Or Chicago. You take a look at Chicago, what’s happening. They had numbers that were just absolutely horrible. And I don’t even want to mention it, but so many people shot, so many people killed. Nobody’s ever heard of this. This is a Democrat runs the city. These are Democrats and they have no clue. They have no cash bail. They get rid of bail. They get rid of all of the things that you need. The police are afraid to do anything. They don’t want to lose their pensions. They don’t want to lose their life. They don’t want to lose their family and their job and everything else that comes with it. And we have to give our great law enforcement people, we have to give them the respect that they deserve. And if we don’t do that, they can never do their job properly. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. And just in closing up, I just say a few words more because it’s so important to me, and your community is so important to me. But many Hispanic Americans came here to pursue the American dream, right? We all want the America. I want the American dream. We all want the American dream. If you look at what they’re asking for, it’s like the American nightmare or whatever you want to call it. But we want the American dream, having left countries that did not have safe streets. Many of you or your family, your mothers, your fathers, they left countries that were very, very bad, very bad, a lot of problems. And if we let this go on, you’d have that. And I often say, we’re not going to be another Venezuela. We love the people of Venezuela. We have tremendous support in Miami, from Venezuelans and Cubans. We’re not going to let that happen to our country. Nobody wants it. And you know who wants it least is Hispanic Americans. They want to see it less than anybody because they know about it more than anybody. And so we’re not going to let that happen. Biden wants to take away your police. He wants to, I wouldn’t say defund in his case, but I will tell you some of his compatriots want to defund your police. Let’s face it. They want to defund your police. They want to take it away. I don’t know who’s going to do the job when they call up at night. You saw the commercial where you call up and they say, “Murder, I’m sorry. We won’t be here for 24 hours.” And then they say, “I’m sorry, rape. We won’t be here for about a week. We’ll call you back in a week.” And this is what you’ll end up with. We can’t do it. We have to treasure our law enforcement. We have to let them do what they’re good at. Another thing I think that’s so important is that we’re defending religious liberty and Joe Biden will totally eliminate religious liberty. He’s going to take away your second amendment because he’s not going to be what I had to put up with in the last four years to defend your second amendment. But you have to have your second amendment. And they’re going to at least obliterate it. They’re going to at least obliterate it. They’re going to abolish school choice. They’re going to abolish charter schools. And we’re going to put charter schools all over wherever we can. We have so many people doing so well, and school choice. And we’ve been very hard on school choice and we’ll get it very much achieved like we have. Nobody’s done as much as we’ve done in three and a half years. Nobody. No administration in their first three and a half years. I say it. I say this that I’ve achieved more for Hispanic Americans in 47 months than Joe Biden is achieved in 47 years. It’s true. It’s true. They don’t call him sleepy Joe for nothing, okay? But a vote for Republicans this November’s a vote for the American dream. And that’s all I have to say. I just want to thank you very much, and I want to thank you very much. And I look forward to hearing from some of the folks at the table and some of these people that I know. I have great respect for all of you I’ve heard of in one way or another. I want to thank you all for being here. Really, it’s a great honor. And Arte, it’s an honor meeting you. And maybe we’ll start with our Governor, our great Governor. And Doug, please say a few words. Thank you. It's my honor, my honor. You know, Doug is very aggressive. He called me up. He called me up once he said, “We really need ventilators badly.” That’s hard. You know, because it’s like they’re big, expensive, very complex, I mean, from a tech standpoint, a high tech standpoint, they have to be perfect. They’re very hard and people don’t have them. Countries don’t have them. And now we’ve become the king. We’re making them like you wouldn’t believe. What did I say? I said, “How many do you need?” “Could you send us a thousand?” I sent a thousand. That’s a lot. But we got them to you. Did we get them to you? A lot of ventilators. Before this pandemic and after this pandemic, our economy has been booming in the state of Arizona. This has been the fastest growing state in the nation. Thank you guys very much. And the relationship with Mexico has been really great. I’ll tell you they have a very good president and we’ve gotten along very well and they’ve actually been very good. We’ve had a real relationship. NAFTA was a disaster for our country and now we have the USMCA, which is Mexico-Canada, and it’s been a great… And we’re not going to lose our businesses now to Mexico and Canada, they’re going to stay right here. So they have a very big economic penalty if they want to play the games of leaving. I mean we lost 55,000 firms went down to different, I mean, different places, but a lot of them went to Mexico, a lot of them went to Canada. There’s a very, very big disincentive to doing that. Well, I’d like to hear, as a baseball fan I’d like to hear from Arte, because he really has done, that team has been glamorized and it’s a great team and great players, great individual players. And let me know about the team a little bit and how you’re doing and let’s hear it. Come on. That’s a beautiful thing to own. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Well, now I really like that team. I liked it before. I didn’t know he was going to do that, but I tell you what, I appreciate it. And your story is an amazing story, it’s a great story. Think of that. And he’s one of the most respected people in sports and in business. And just a great story. Thank you very much. It’s a great honor to be with you. Thank you. Yeah. But they were nice. This is very special. That's great. That's what I thought. Oh, that's very good. That's very nice. Thank you. And it is getting a lot easier to be Republican for as you say, minority. It’s getting a lot easier, whether you’re Hispanic or anything else. It’s a beautiful thing to see what’s happening with the Republican Party. And remember it’s the party of Abraham Lincoln. A lot of people forget that. Abraham Lincoln was a Republican. The other side likes to try and claim him, big disinformation, but they can’t get away with that one so, hey, thank you very much. It’s great. Please go ahead. That's great. Thank you very much. Great. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Good. Good. Good. Thank you. Great. That's a great job. Beautiful story. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. And look what happened in New York where they cut a billion dollars and they got rid of a lot of great, great crime fighters. And look at what happened in a short period. Sounds good. Good governor there. Good governor. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Please. Has to be doing well. How's it doing? Wasn't doing well for a little while, now it's doing good right? That's good. That's good. Yes, I know. Thank you, sir. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you, sir. But the real reason is that, I tweeted out, I saw they were giving him a hard time and I tweeted out, this is a great couple. And I looked at him, I said, “Look at this couple.” And they were giving him a hard time and they were trying to do a boycott because this other side is very vicious. They’ll try and do boycotts. So I said, “You know what? It’s not very presidential, but I’m going to do a tweet for Sammy and his beautiful wife.” And you never saw lines like this ever before. And that’s the reason. And I’ll tell you, you’ve been great. And I appreciate it. I hear the places is doing fantastic. Yeah, go ahead. Thank you. I will. Beautiful. Wow. That was a good job. That was actually very good. Are you proud of him? Thank you. Go ahead. Follow that. Go follow that. Good. That’s really nice. Thank you. Beautiful. Say hello to your wife, please. That’s really nice. I appreciate it. We have made a lot of strides with the opioid and the drugs, but you get set back with this China virus was a big setback, but now we’re back to business, but we did get set back with this horrible thing that was sent. It could have been stopped. It should have been stopped. It should have been stopped. They stopped it going into their country, but not coming into our country, not coming into Europe and the rest of the world. But I appreciate, those are beautiful words. Thank you very much. Please, go ahead. Good. That's great. Thank you. Thank you. Not going to happen here. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Please. Thank you very much. Oh, great. That's good. That's good. Great. Thank you very much. Thank you. Great job. Great job, thank you. School choice, absolutely right. Thank you. Please. Thank you. And they’re beautiful. And they’re beautiful kids too.

That’s a nice looking good too. Nice looking. Beautiful. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. That's great. That's great. Thank you very much. [inaudible 01:16:37]. Great. Well, I just want to finish by saying my people told me this was going to take about one-third of the time, but after these stories started going, I wasn’t leaving. I want to tell you, they are incredible stories, success stories, all success stories. You’ve done so well. The Hispanic community is amazing. I knew that from many years ago, long before I thought about doing this whole deal in politics. I didn’t have to be told about the Hispanic community. I dealt with them. Natural business people, great business people. Great, great business people. You have to be very sharp when you deal with Hispanic Americans, or my Latinos. I love the Latinos, but I’ve always known how great you were. And [Arty’s 01:17:25] a great example of it, one of your great examples of it. But it’s a fantastic community. I will never let you down. I will tell you, I’ll never let you down. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Artie, thank you very much.

"60","09-15-20","Thank you very much. Please. Thank you. The First Lady and I are honored to welcome to the White House Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel, and Mrs. Netanyahu. Thank you so much. Thank you, Sara. And Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed, United Arab Emirates, UAE. Thank you very much. And Foreign Minister Abdullatif Al Zayani of Bahrain. Thank you. Thank you very much. We’re here this afternoon to change the course of history. After decades of division and conflict, we mark the dawn of a new Middle East. Thanks to the great courage of the leaders of these three countries, we take a major stride toward a future in which people of all faiths and backgrounds live together in peace and prosperity. In a few moments, these visionary leaders will sign the first two peace deals between Israel and the Arab state in more than a quarter century. In Israel’s entire history, there have previously been only two such agreements; now we have achieved two in a single month, and there are more to follow. Israel, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain will establish embassies, exchange ambassadors, and begin to cooperate and work together so strongly, to cooperate as partners across the broad range of sectors from tourism to trade and healthcare to security; they’re going to work together. They are friends. The Abraham Accords also open the door for Muslims around the world to visit the historic sites in Israel and to peacefully pray at Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, the third holiest site in Islam. Together, these agreements will serve as the foundation for a comprehensive piece across the entire region, something which nobody thought was possible, certainly not in this day and age, maybe in many decades from now, but one founded on shared interests, mutual respect and friendship, to our honored guests from Israel, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. Congratulations on this outstanding achievement. Congratulations. Fantastic. I also want to thank Vice President Mike Pence. Thank you, Mike. Great job. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Mike, thank you very much. National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien. Robert, thank you. Mr. Jared Kushner. Jared, thank you very much. Ambassador Brian Hook. Thank you very much, Brian. Thank you. Thank you. And Avi Berkowitz. Avi, thank you very much. I also want to give a very special thanks, he’s been an incredible ambassador to Israel, David Friedman. That’s a very great group of people, great group of patriots. They wanted this to happen so badly, they worked so hard, and again, nobody thought it could happen and they thought it could happen; they never even doubted it. So I want to thank you all very much. Thank you. For generations, the people of the Middle East have been held back by old conflicts, hostilities, lies treachery; so many things held them back. Actually, lies that the Jews and Arabs were enemies and that Al Aqsa Mosque was under attack. Constantly, they would say it was under attack. These lies passed down from generation to generation fueled a vicious cycle of terror and violence that spread across the region and all over the world. These agreements prove that the nations of the region are breaking free from the failed approaches of the past. Today’s signing sets history on a new course, and there will be other countries very, very soon that will follow these great leaders. The people of the Middle East will no longer allow hatred of Israel to be fomented as an excuse for radicalism or extremism. So important. And they’ll no longer allow the great destiny of their region to be denied. On my first foreign trip as president, I had the honor of addressing the leaders of more than 54 Arab and Muslim nations in Saudi Arabia. My message that day was very simple. I urged the nations of the Middle East to set aside their differences, unite against the common enemy of civilization, and work together toward the noble aims of security and prosperity. I offered America’s friendship, I offered America’s help, but I said clearly that the nations of the regions had to decide what kind of a future they wanted for their children and for their families and for their nation itself. No one could make that choice for them. They had to do that themselves. Today, the world sees that they’re choosing cooperation over conflict, friendship over enmity, prosperity over poverty, and hope over despair. They are choosing a future in which Arabs and Israelis, Muslims, Jews, and Christians can live together, pray together and dream together, side by side in harmony, community and peace. Once again, let me congratulate the people of Israel, the people of the United Arab Emirates and the people of the kingdom of Bahrain. God bless you all. This is an incredible day for the world. This is a really wonderful and beautiful occasion. I want to thank all of the members of Congress for being here, senators, Congressmen, Congresswoman. We just appreciate it so much. Everybody wanted to be here. It’s a very important day for the world. It’s a very important day for peace. Before the parties sign the Accords, I’d like to ask Prime Minister Netanyahu to say a few words, followed by the foreign minister of the United Arab Emirates and the foreign minister of Bahrain. Thank you very much. It’s a great honor. Thank you. Thank you very-Thank you very much. Thank you very much. I appreciate-Great job. Great job. That's a great job. Beautiful. Fellas, come on over here. It's easiest. Should we flip them over? Or-Yeah. Sure. So glad. Yeah. You're good? Hold that up. Good. Now, you do this. Thank you.

"61","09-16-20","Thank you very much, everyone. Thank you. Good afternoon, Hurricane Sally made landfall, as you know, in Alabama and Florida last night as a category two hurricane and has caused 35 inches of rainfall in some places, that’s a lot. We have hundreds of FEMA, Coast Guard. We have the National Guard personnel on the ground assisting in response to the efforts and Alabama is in great shape. And every place that we are working with the state governments, really in great shape. We are working very hard on that, but it looks like it’s going to be mostly safe, but just follow the instructions of all of your local and federal people there. We have the best people that you can have. So I want to thank everybody. I want to thank everybody for working so hard in Florida, and they’re very good at this. The people in Florida handle it, they know how to handle it and the people working there know how to handle it. The governors have all been spoken to, and it’s a combination of real spirit and they have a tremendous esprit de corps. They have a tremendous sense of working on hurricanes. They’ve gotten very good at it. We’ve certainly had plenty of, even since I’ve been here, we’ve had a lot of them. So that’s in good shape, hurricane Sally. We’re going to talk about Big 10 football, but that’s a terrific thing. We’ll discuss that at the end. I just want to go into the vaccine distribution. Today, my administration released our detailed national vaccine distribution plan, and that includes a plan to ensure that we swiftly deliver the vaccine directly to America’s senior citizens in nursing homes. And it’s all set. We have our military lined up, everybody’s lined up and we think that’s going to go very nicely. We’re very close to that vaccine, as you know, and I think closer than most people want to say, or certainly closer than most people understand. To get the vaccine into the hands of American people, we’re fully mobilizing the awesome power of American industry and also our military. This is the largest, fastest, and most advanced vaccine distribution effort in American history by far. I was reading where Biden was saying that, oh, he’s going to have a plan. They did so bad on swine flu. You wouldn’t even believe it. Take a look at their record on swine flu. In fact, the person that headed it up said it was a total disaster. We’re on track to deliver and distribute the vaccine in a very, very safe and effective manner. We think we can start sometime in October. So as soon as it is announced, we’ll be able to start. That’ll be from mid-October on, that may be a little bit later than that, but we’ll be all set. So as soon as it’s given the go ahead, they’re doing trials as you know, and as soon as it’s given the go ahead, we will get it out, defeat the virus. We’ve manufactured all of the necessary supplies, so that as soon as the FDA approves the vaccine, and as you know, we’re very close to that, we’ll be able to distribute at least 100 million vaccine doses by the end of 2020 and a large number much sooner than that. I’m calling on Biden to stop promoting his anti-vaccine theories because all they’re doing is hurting the importance of what we’re doing. And I know that if they were in this position, they’d be saying how wonderful it is. They’re recklessly endangering lives, you can’t do that. And again, this is really a case that they just started talking a little bit negatively and that’s only because they know we have it, or we will soon have it. And the answer to that is very soon. The case updates, it’s very interesting to see what’s happening because the test positivity rate is down among all age groups and has fallen below 5% for the first time since this whole nightmare of the China virus began. So it’s fallen below 5%. The number of hospitalized patients has decreased by 43% from mid-July, 43%. Nationally people sick with the China virus now make up only 1.5% of all emergency room visits. So we’re down to the lowest number we’ve had. 1.5% of emergency room visits is for the China virus. And thanks to our life saving therapies and treatments, I think this is the best of all in terms of our great percentages and all the progress we’ve made. The fatality rate has fallen 85% since April, 85% fatality rate. If you look at what we’ve done and all of the lives that we’ve saved, and I’m going to ask that a graph we put up and now it’s up. This was right at the beginning, this was our prediction that if we do a really good job, we’ll be at about a hundred and 100,000 to 240,000 deaths. And we’re below that substantially and we’ll see what comes out, but that would be if we did a good job, if the not so good job was done, you’d be between 1.5 million, I remember these numbers so well, and 2.2 million. That’s quite a difference. So we’re down in this [inaudible 00:09:53] and that’s despite the fact that the blue states had tremendous death rates. If you take the blue states out, were at a level that I don’t think anybody in the world would be at. we’re really at a very low level, but some of the states, they were blue states and blue state management. By the way, we would recommend they open up their states. I think it’s very important that they open up their states because if you look at certain of them, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and a couple of others, we have to get those states open. It’s hurting people. It’s hurting people far more than the disease itself. So we would recommend that you open them, let you people have freedom, and it’s unfair to your people to keep them closed at this stage. We know the vaccines are coming, but we know the problem, we understand who the vulnerable are, which is primarily people with medical problems, but in particular, people with medical problems that are older. So open up your states. To facilitate routine testing of the nursing home residents and staff we’ve delivered rapid testing devices to all 13,850 certified nursing homes nationwide. So you have 13,850 certified nursing homes nationwide, and they are being facilitated in terms of testing and testing apparatus. Everything is there. We also have new tests coming and we have one in particular that I think I showed last night, which is literally two pieces of very fine cardboard. It’s actually a lot of delicate things going on inside that cardboard, but it’s an incredible test. It’s very quick, it’s very accurate and moves along rapidly. We bought millions of those tests and they’re going to be distributed rapidly. So the testing process where there’s nobody in the world that has a testing process like ours, in addition to being a number one. Number two, which is India, is close to 50 million tests behind us, I believe, Scott. 50 million. They have 1.5 billion people. Tomorrow, Vice President Pence will be announcing the findings of the nursing home commission to continue protecting our most vulnerable, which is our senior citizens and we’re going to take good care of them. I want to congratulate Big 10 football. It’s back. And I want to, in particular, I’ve been dealing with him, thank Commissioner Kevin Warren, for the great job he did. We’ve been working with him for a while. There was a rumor being spread that I didn’t want football back and it was just the opposite. That was another disinformation rumor were put out by the Biden campaign and it was just the opposite, but it really spurred me into action. I called the commissioner a couple of weeks ago and we started really putting a lot of pressure on, frankly, because it was no reason for it not to come back. And Kevin went in and worked very hard. I want to thank the players, the coaches for working along and they wanted it very badly. The players and coaches in particular, the parents also. And Big 10 football just announced, as you know, that they’re scheduled. They announced a schedule and it’s going to be great, important to have. I want to recommend that the PAC 12 also get going, because there’s no reason why PAC 12, shouldn’t be playing now. And perhaps they’ll start with at least partially, I had recommended today to Kevin and others that maybe you want to start off with 25% of the stadium, or maybe you want to start off with empty, I don’t know. I think they could have fans go, frankly, but they want to be careful. They want to be safe and they will be safe. They’ve got a very good testing process for the players, coaches, families, et cetera. And so I just want to congratulate Big 10. It’s going to be great. We’re going to love watching that. And again, I want to recommend PAC 12. You’re the only one now. Open up, open up PAC 12. Get going. Said the same thing to Big 10 and they did. And now I’m saying it to PAC 12. You have time. You really have time right now. Get going. I want to thank all of those wonderful coaches, some of whom I spoke with. And we went through a process over the last a couple of weeks, and I want to thank Congressman Anthony Gonzales of Ohio, who, as you know, was a great football player. Some people know that. I know that. But Anthony was a great player. Great receiver, went to the NFL. Also, I want to thank Tim Pataki of my staff. He worked very hard on this and he was up day and night working with Kevin and everybody else. So I want to thank Tim Pataki. Great job. So Big 10 is back and it’s going to have hopefully a great season. The census recently found that in the second quarter of 2020 Hispanic Americans home ownership reached a record all time high. That’s all time in the history of our country. Yesterday, the census reported that median income for Americans increased by an unprecedented $4,400 last year to a record of $68,700. In 2019 income inequality fell for the second straight year. The income gap widened under the Obama/Biden administration and it widened fairly substantially and it narrowed under the Trump administration. So there’s a little fact that you didn’t know, so it narrowed under us and it widened under Obama. Income grew more last year, we are alone than over the entire eight years of Obama/Biden. And that’s a big statement, but that’s the way it is. In 2019, 4.2 million Americans were lifted out of poverty. That’s the largest poverty reduction under any president in history. 4.2 million Americans were lifted out of poverty. The Hispanic-American poverty rate reached the lowest level ever history of our country. Hispanic American poverty rate, lowest level ever. I created the greatest and fairest economy in history, the biggest gains went to lower income Americans as they measure that kind of thing. We will be back to full strength very soon. We’re going to have a fantastic year next year. It’s looking like that. I think you’re going to have an incredible third quarter. The numbers are looking very, very strong for the third quarter. We have numbers that we’re going to put out tomorrow. Some of the individual things, car production, housing production, housing ownership, so many different things that are just at levels that nobody thought possible as we round the turn on the pandemic. the anti-police crusade from the Democrats and the radical left and radical left Democrats also, has to stop. The left wing war on cops puts our officers in danger and our communities at very grave risk. Can’t do this. Communities at very grave risk. Can’t do this. Biden described the police as the enemy. They’re not the enemy, they’re the friend. They’re our friend. They’re helping us. And if you go to… I just saw a poll, just came out or recently came out, where African Americans by 84%, wanted more police. They wanted safe neighborhoods. In Phoenix, last night, a federal officer was gunned down in a drive-by shooting. In L.A., this weekend, everybody saw that, this horrible human being, or whatever you might want to call him, [inaudible 00:00:36]. They’re looking all over, they’re trying to find him. We’re going to find out, we’re going to get them. But in L.A. this weekend, two Sheriff’s deputies were ambushed and viciously shot, and they can never be the same. They’re getting better, but they can never be the same. I’ll always stand by our heroes of law enforcement. And we want to stop this horrible rhetoric, and stop it fast. I want to ask Scott Atlas to say a couple of words, because I heard Biden talking to today about, he wants to come up with a distribution plan, a distribution for the vaccine that we came up with. A couple of things, we came up with that vaccine, it’ll be announced fairly soon. But regardless, this month, next month. In a level of time that nobody thought was possible because of what we did with our FDA, in terms of streamlining it. I want to thank Dr. Hahn. But what we’ve done with the streamlining has been incredible and very safely. Number one is safety, number two is speed. But you can have perfect safety and have much more speed. And that’s what we did. We did this for more than the vaccine having to do with the China virus, this was also for other things. So many other great drugs are out there, that would take 10, 12 years to get them approved. We’ve moved those schedules up a lot. But if this were Obama, Biden, this would have taken two, three years before you were at a stage where we are now at. So we’re going to be very soon. And it’s sort of funny to watch Joe Biden getting up and reading a teleprompter and saying how he would have done this. They had H1N1, he calls it the N1H1, it’s H1N1, it’s called the swine flu. And it was a disaster. And as I said, the person that ran it for him said the worst things about it. I mean, they didn’t know what they were doing, they quit. And they had no clue. And that was easy by comparison to this. This is the most contagious flu or virus that anybody’s seen. This is unbelievable how contagious it is. You found that out. But I watched a Biden quickly as he discussed without knowing a thing about a distribution plan. And he said that we don’t have a distribution plan, but we do indeed. There are military. We have military, we have everybody involved. It’s a great plan. And it’s a plan like no other. And we can start doing it. I believe the day that we come up with a vaccine, when it’s done, we’ll start that same day or the day after. Our military is very much involved. And they deploy troops. These are the generals that do logistics and all of those things. And we’ll have it all over the country. And then ultimately, hopefully we’ll be helping the world with the vaccine. And it’s very exciting, but maybe I’d ask Scott Atlas to come up and describe a little bit about that, the distribution plan in particular. Because Biden acted as though there was no distribution plan. And we’ve been working on this for months and it’s ready. And Scott has really taken a haul of it and done an incredible job. And please, Scott, thank you. Good. Thank you. Yeah, go ahead. No. I think he made a mistake when he said that. It’s just incorrect information. And I called him and he didn’t tell me that. And I think he got the message. Maybe confused, maybe it was stated incorrectly. No, we’re ready to go immediately, as the vaccine is announced. And it could be announced in October, could be announced a little bit after October. But once we go, we’re ready. As you know, Pfizer’s making this, they’re taking a tremendous financial risk and they’re spending billions of dollars on actually making this vaccine. They’re at a stage where they’re actually making it because they feel very confident as to the results. They’ll be announcing their results fairly soon. And no, that’s incorrect information. Yeah, I think so, but I don’t think he means that. I don’t think he… When he said it, I believe he was confused. I’m just telling you, we’re ready to go as soon as the vaccine happens. I would say that, yeah, we will start distributing it immediately. To the general public, very shortly there. I mean, really to the general public immediately. When we go, we go. We’re not looking to say, “Gee in six months, we’re going to start giving it to the general public.” No, we want to go immediately. No, it was an incorrect statement. I saw the statement, I called him. I said, “What did you mean by that?” And I think he just made a mistake. He just made a mistake. I think he misunderstood the question, probably. I think it would be very soon. I think our distribution process is going to go very quickly. I told you we’ve engaged the military. We have a General who’s in charge of all logistics, who delivers soldiers. He’s fantastic guy, supposed to be fantastic at what he does. And we figured that’s better than any company you’re going to hire. You can’t hire a company like that. And we look to do distribution immediately after we get the word that it’s good. And I think they’re having tremendous success with the vaccine itself. I think the results will be early and strong. The safety has to be 100% and we’re going to insist on that. And obviously the companies are going to insist on that. Scott, what would you think? Q1, he said. And you also have more than one company. You have Johnson & Johnson, you have Pfizer, you have Moderna, you have others. So we could conceivably have vaccines being given out by numerous companies. And they’re all world-class companies, they’re fantastic companies. That could happen also. Yeah. Please go ahead. Okay, they’re giving me studies on the deal, has to be a hundred percent as far as national security is concerned. And no, I’m not prepared to sign off on anything. I have to see the deal. We need security, especially after what we’ve seen with respect to China and what’s going on. We want security. So, I’ll let you know. They’re going to be reporting to me tomorrow morning and I will let you know. We’re going to see about that. Amazingly, I find that you’re not allowed to do that. You’re not allowed to accept… And I say, “What kind of a thing is this?” If they’re willing to make big payments to the government, they’re not allowed because there’s no legal path to doing that. And I’m saying, “Wait a minute, they’re willing to make a big payment to the government and we’re not allowed to take the money. When does this happen? How foolish can we be?” So we’re looking into that right now. You understand that? I said, “No, I want a big chunk of that money to go to the United States government because we made it possible. And the lawyers come back to me and they say, “Well, there’s no way of doing that.” You know why? Because nobody’s ever heard of that before. Nobody’s ever said that before. Nobody’s ever said, “Well, we’ll approve the deal, but we want a lot of money to go the government. Because by approving the deal, we’re making the deal valuable.” They’ve never heard of that before. Can you believe that? Right? Hard to believe. We’re going to find out about that. We’re looking into that from the standpoint of ByteDance, We don’t like that. I mean, just conceptually, I can tell you I don’t like that. That has not been told to me yet. That has been reported, but it hasn’t been told to me. It could be very accurate reporting for a change. So if that’s the case, I’m not going to be happy with that. Assuming that ByteDance is China, which I think it probably is. Yeah, in the back. The question was asked to me about, if you have violent demonstrations. Yes, we will put it down very, very quickly, if there is. Absolutely. And I think the American public wants to see that. Yeah. OEN please. OEN. Just a minute. If there’s any kind of demonstration or violence, there will be nothing that interferes with this product, this vote. There’s going to be nothing. The biggest problem we have right now, are the ballots. Millions of ballots going out, that’s the biggest problem. When you talk about other countries, whether it’s China, Russia, or many others that get mentioned. They’re in a much better position with these paper ballots to do something than they would ever be under the old system. And that’s our biggest problem. Our biggest threat to this election is governors from opposing parties, controlling ballots, millions of ballots. To me, that’s a much bigger threat than foreign countries. Because much of the stuff coming out about foreign countries turned out to be untrue. What is true, is that many elections have taken place over the last year and a half using this ballot system. They’ve been off by 5%, 10%, 15%. I think I read one at 40%, 40%. And these are small, easy to control elections. This whole ballot system, where you can send it in and it’s not even requested. We’re not talking about it solicited, they’re unsolicited ballots. And they’re sent in, is very dangerous for our country. And you know, who knows that better than anybody, the Democrats. Look at what happened in Manhattan, where they had this kind of an election. And it was so fraudulent that it should never have been allowed to be called. We could have five, 10, 15, 20% off. We could have more than that. The ballots will be stolen, who knows where they’re going, who knows where they’re coming from. It’s not just the counting of the ballots, which by the way, which will take forever. It’ll take forever. You think November 3rd, you might not have… I guess, at a certain point, it goes to Congress. At a certain point, it goes to Congress, you know that. This is a disgrace. This is being done on purpose. They know it’s no good. They know it’s going to be fraudulent. It’s going to be fraud all over the place. Who’s getting the ballots, who’s sending the balance. They have people saying you don’t need a verified signature. This is a serious threat to our democracy. And the Democrats know that. All we’re asking, if you solicit the ballot, you go through a process. You ask for a ballot because you can’t be there. For a large number of reasons, for whatever reasons. I’m doing it myself. I won’t be able to be in Florida. You solicit and they send it back. You do it and you send it back. That’s a process that you go through. And it’s pretty secure. I used the word pretty secure. I guess, nothing’s foolproof. But what’s pretty close to what… The most foolproof thing, the thing that really works, is you go to the ballot box. It’s going to be very safe. I think by that time COVID will be even lower. It’s going to be very low. It’s going to be a very safe process. We did it during World War I. We did it during World War II. The biggest threat to this election is these unsolicited ballots sent out by the millions. Controlled by governors, like in Nevada. Who is a political person, very political, far beyond being governor. Where they try to stop you from making the speech, unsuccessfully. But we had to move around a lot, had to move quickly. So, this same guy that tried to stop you from making free speech, outside, not inside, outside. They forced us inside because of what they did, but outside. This is the guy that’s controlling ballots. Then you look at Pennsylvania, you look at other places, it is a big threat. And as far as China’s concerned and Russia, and they say North Korea, they say Iran, they say places, who knows, who knows, but they say all these different places, they can make forgeries of these ballots, they can do things that will blow your mind. And the Democrats know it’s wrong, they know it’s going to end up being a disaster. Just take a look at what’s happened over the last year with this same kind of thing, except in a very small setting with very few ballots going out, so that’s much easier, not 53 to 80 million going out, a very small number. And you know what’s happened? Fraud like you’ve never seen, missing ballots, ballots that never showed up ballots with bad signatures, ballots with no signatures. And in the case of Nevada, they don’t even want verification of the signature. It’s a disgrace. Now the hope for our nation is it’s before judges in Pennsylvania, it’s before judges in Nevada, it’s before judges and other places, it’s before federal judges. And hopefully they’ll do what they did the other day in Pennsylvania, where we had a great victory, open up your state, it’s unconstitutional to close it. Because what they were doing is closing it and closing it for political reasons. It’ll open on November 4th, it’ll open up right after the election. But they want our numbers to be as bad as possible, but the problem is our numbers are so good, with or without various states opening up, with or without. But we had a big legal victory, as you know, three days ago, a federal judge told them to open up their state, “It’s unconstitutional what you’re doing,” that’s in the case of Pennsylvania. Now the big cases are going to be the cases on these unsolicited ballots and we’ll see what happens. All right, OAN please. We don’t want to see that, we’ve been very strong on that. We’re getting reports in over the next two, three days, we’ll know very accurately what the story is and we’ll then take action, one way or the other. Well, I have real questions about it. Look, the US, we just won a $7.5 Billion dollar lawsuit, which nobody used to sue before I came along, or they used lose them every single time. Now they haven’t been losing them. But we’re getting reports on the WTO, it’s not good. Never been good to us. The WTO, as far as I’m concerned, was created to suck money and jobs out of the United States to the benefit of China and other countries, that’s what my opinion is. Whether it was created, or it just turned out to be that way. But the World Trade Organization has been not good for the United States. It’s been good for everybody else, but it’s not been good. It was a method, in my opinion, of taking advantage of the United States. So we’re looking into what happened and we’ll get back to you fast. I think he made a mistake, yeah. I didn’t go into any great depth. I was very surprised to hear it. It doesn’t really matter. Here’s what does matter, we’re all set to distributor immediately. As soon as that vaccine comes out, that’s safe and good and works, whether it’s Pfizer, Johnson&Johnson or anybody else, we are ready to distribute it very rapidly. As Scott said, and as our team knows and they’re ready, and it could be in October, sometime in October, or November. I don’t think it’s going to be much later than that, but I think it could be sometime in October. We’re ready to move and it will be a very full distribution. No, I didn’t tell him anything. I said, “What happened?” And I got the impression that he didn’t realize he said what he might’ve said. I didn’t see him say it, but if that’s what he said, it’s a mistake because we’re so ready. We’re ready to distribute immediately to a vast section of our country. And then beyond, because we want to help other countries also. But we’re ready to distribute immediately. Kaitlan, we’re focused on high risk, but we’re going to focus also on general public very much. But our immediate aim is elderly people and especially elderly people with heart, diabetes problems. But we will have it… we’re not looking at a small distribution program, we’re looking at distributing to the whole United States with an immediate focus of the elderly. Now, under no circumstance will it be as late as the doctor said. But I think that, frankly, if they hit him with that question, he said that, we are ready at a much faster level than what he said. We will have rapid distribution. We’re set up, our military and others are set up to do it. And we think it could even start taking place in October, but certainly during November, December would be the latest because based on what I’m hearing results are very good. So we’ll see what happens. Well, what I was saying to him… No, but that was a long time ago when I said that, we weren’t set up at that time. Well, how many months ago? When was the statement made? His book is sort of obsolete because the book comes out… By the way I read the book last night very rapidly because it was very boring. I read it and if you see what I said, I said a lot of really good things. I mean, for the most part, people like to turn it around, but I said really good things in that book. And as an example, he doesn’t cover I told him what we’re doing in the Middle East, and we’re doing it in an entirely different way and that’s not covered in his book. The whole thing is not covered in his book. And one thing I will say, and I respect the press for this one, which was interesting, almost universally, we’ve been praised for the deal that we made yesterday with Israel and with the two very important countries in the Middle East. And UAE in particular, where it’s a very powerful group, it’s a warrior country, it’s led by a great warrior and a man who’s highly respected. And if you take a look at that and Bahrain and Israel making a deal, and I will tell you, we have at least four or five others that want to come in. They would have come in yesterday, I talked to two of them yesterday and they’re ready to trot. And I think you’re going to have a whole level of peace without blood all over the sand. Nobody was shot, nobody was killed. We killed hundreds of thousands of people in the Middle East. It’s all it’s been… I always say it’s the bloodiest sand anywhere in the world. And it didn’t have to be that way. The single worst decision our country ever made was to go into the Middle East. Not only the millions of people killed, and I include people on both sides, some people say, “Oh, you shouldn’t say that.” I said, “I’ll say it,” on both sides. Such a horrible thing was done. Such a horrible mistake was made. We’re doing this a different way. So we have those two countries. We have at least five that we’re negotiating with right now. And you can only negotiate with so many, I think they’re all going to come in. I think ultimately the Palestinians are going to come in. These are all the people that are funding them. I stopped funding the Palestinians fairly early on because they were saying bad things about our country. I said, “Well you mean, we’re giving them $750 million a year and they’re saying all bad things about our country?” So I stopped funding them very early on, but they get funded by other very rich countries, to them it’s like a spec, it’s nothing. But they get funded. But I think now that these countries, these very rich countries are a part of the deal and you’ll see, over the next fairly short period of time, other countries will come in. I think Saudi Arabia ultimately will come in too, I think getting Saudi Arabia will be great. But I think Saudi Arabia, this is my feeling, it’s not based on knowledge, other than a couple of conversations I had with the King. But Saudi Arabia I think will be coming in too and you’ll end up with peace in the Middle East. And nobody thought it could be done and nobody thought it could be done this way. I went to some very smart people. I went to some people in Middle East and they said, “You’ll never be able to do it, it’s not possible to make peace.” Well, now they’re saying to me, “Nobody ever thought of doing this. They all thought you make the deal first with the Palestinians. It had to be that way.” And I will say the resistance was some countries didn’t want to do it unless the Palestinians were there first, that was just a psychological thing, more than anything else. But they were wrong. The people, our great representatives that have been doing this for 35 years that were telling me how to do it, but they all failed. They were in Clinton’s Administration, they were in Bush, they were in Obama, all these great, brilliant people, they’re all telling me how to do it and I said they’re wrong and I guess I was right. And when you see… Well, let’s finish this. When you see the countries that will be coming, a very short period of time, not talking to a long period of time, all of the countries that will be coming in, just like you saw Bahrain yesterday and UAE and I can think of, I mean, at least five that are going to be quick and easy. Others will be quick and easy also, once the five come in. So you’re going to have something, you’re going to have peace in the Middle East. And we want to get out, our soldiers largely coming home. I said the endless wars, the ridiculous, endless wars. And I will say this, if I didn’t withdraw our country from that horrible Iran Nuclear Deal, that horrible, stupid deal where President Obama paid $150 billion for nothing and gave $1.8 billion in cash. 1.8 billion, you know what that is? 1.8 billion in cash, that’s more impressive than the $150 billion paid normally. But he gave all this money, all of these chips that we had, we had these chips and he gave them all away and we got nothing. And you know, it was a short term deal. It would be practically expiring now. Practically, it starts to expire actually right now, but it would practically be. And there is no way we will let Iran have a nuclear weapon, just to remember that, there’s no way that’s going to happen. Well, the vaccine, at the time, I thought it might take that period of time, but we’ve stepped it up very substantially. And now, I mean, I’m just telling this is just what it is, we’ve been able to step it up very, very rapidly. I never thought we could have a vaccine as quickly as we did, but I freed it up, I freed up the FDA, Dr. Hahn’s done a great job and they’re ready to approve something when they come in. The other thing that’s happening that’s very different is you look at a company like Pfizer, great company, really one of the great companies of the world, Johnson&Johnson, they’re all great companies, they’re doing a lot of testing at a very rapid rate that nobody’s ever seen anything like it. They’re in the third level of trial and I think that you’re going to see things that are amazing. When I made statements like that, that’s an old statement. When I made statements like that, I had no idea that we could produce as well as we’re producing. But only because of what I’ve done with the FDA and other things can we come up with numbers like that. We’re lucky that we don’t have to, because that was considered fast. If this were an administration from the past, and I think I can say far beyond Obama, it was other administrations also, you wouldn’t have a vaccine for two and a half, three years, and we’re going to have a vaccine within, at most, a couple of months. Okay? Something like that, yeah. I like the larger amount, I’ve said that, some of the Republicans disagree, but I think I can convince them to go along with it, because I like the larger number. I want to see people get money, it wasn’t their fault that this happened, it was China’s fault. You know? People say, “Well, maybe you shouldn’t say that, that’s not nice.” It was China’s fault. So I would like to see the larger number, yeah. I would like to see it. There’s some things I disagree with, but I’m sure they can be negotiating. Now, I heard Nancy Pelosi said she doesn’t want to leave until we have an agreement. She’s come a long way, that’s great. If she said that, she’s come a long way. I agree with her, we should have an agreement, people should be helped and they should be helped as rapidly as possible. And I think it’s going to happen, I think it’s very important. So the Problem Solvers came up with, it’s a group of people in Congress, as you know, you know them all, I know them all, they’re very good people, I guess you’d consider them dead center. But in many cases they’re not, they’re left they’re right, but they came up with this idea and I think they’re well on their way to suggesting some pretty good things. Yeah, I agree with a lot of it. I think the things I don’t agree, we can probably negotiate. But I think we’ve made some progress over the last week and I think it was positive that they came out with that report. Well, not that proposal, but we’re getting closer. We’re getting closer. I do like a lot of money getting sent to people that really were hurt unnecessarily by China because they could have stopped it. They stopped it from going into their country, they could have stopped it from coming to our country and from going to Europe and from going to the rest of the world, 188 different countries from all over the world. Please? And to masks. Okay. Number one, it’s not more effective, by any means, than a vaccine. And I called him about that, those were the two things I discussed with him. And I believe that if you ask him, he would probably say that he didn’t understand the question, because I asked him those two questions, the one question which we covered, and the mask question… And I was inaccurately covered because I was on with George last night, George Stephanopoulos, and I enjoyed it, I think people enjoyed it, a lot of people said very good things about the show. I hope they did well, but they said a lot of good things about the show. But they always cut my sentences off, they cut it off on masks and masks have problems too. When I talked about the masks have to be handled very gently, very carefully. I see that in restaurants that people with masks and they’re playing around with their mask and their fingers are in their mask and then they’re serving with plates. I mean, I think there’s a lot of problems with masks. Now, vaccine is much more effective than the masks. And if we get the vaccine, we have added to the fact that our numbers are going way down, you see the numbers, I’m just reading your statistics that are from wherever they get them, but they’re very highly qualified statistics. But no, the mask is not as important as the vaccine. The mask perhaps helps you. Don’t forget a lot of people didn’t like the concept of masks, initially. Dr. Fauci didn’t like them and a lot of people didn’t. And I’m not knocking anybody because I understand both sides of the argument, but when I called up Robert today, I said to him, “What’s with the mask?” He said, “I think I answered that question incorrectly.” I think maybe he had misunderstood it. I mean, he had two questions; maybe he misunderstood both of them. But the answer to the one, is it’s going to be a much faster distribution than he said. Maybe he’s not aware of the distribution process. It’s not really his thing as much as it would be, let’s say, mine. But the distribution is going to be much faster. As far as the mask is concerned, I hope that the vaccine is going to be a lot more beneficial than the masks. Because people have used the masks, but when I looked at that chart that we put up, if you look, if you do the good job, they had I guess 240,000. But if it worked out well… Now look, one death is too much. One death is too much. Should have never happened. But the lower level was at that 240,000, between a 100 and something and 240,000. As far as the mask is concerned, he made a mistake. No, they may be effective. And I wear them when I’m in a hospital or what I’m in a setting with a lot-Well, I’m tested, and I’m sometimes surprised when I see somebody sitting, like with Joe, Joe feels very safe in a mask. I don’t know, maybe he doesn’t want to expose his face. I don’t know what’s going on. He’ll be way away from people, nowhere near people. There’ll be nobody with him. He doesn’t draw any crowds. So have circles, these big circles, they’ll be way far away. There’s no reason for him to have masks on. We get tested. I’m tested. I have people tested. When people come into the oval office, it’s like a big deal. No matter who they are, the heads of countries, they all get tested. So I’m in a different position. And maybe if I wasn’t in that position, I’d be wearing it more. But I’ve worn masks. And especially, I like to wear them when I’m in a hospital. Not for me so much as for other people, okay? Thanks. Well, he didn’t say minorities, he said minorities and senior citizens. Well, I’ll go first, because I appreciate your question. And yeah, we’ve had a tremendous drop in poverty for all people in our nation, but in particular for African Americans. And that statistic came in, and it’s because the African American community, the black community, has had the lowest, the best employment numbers that we’ve ever had, both employment and unemployment, depending on how you want to define it. But we’ve had the best employment numbers we’ve ever had. Now, we had the greatest employment in the country ever, almost 160 million people. We’ve never been close to that number, but we were just six months ago. And yeah, I’m very proud of the numbers. African Americans, Hispanic Americans, they had the best numbers they’ve ever had by far, both employment and unemployment, depending on definition. Thank you very much for that question. Scott, do you want to answer that? I will say, this is a phenomena that only happened when they realized that we may very well have the vaccine prior to a certain very important date, namely, November 3rd. Once they heard that, the Democrats started, just to show you how bad the intention is, they started knocking the vaccine. Had nothing to do with the vaccine. It was totally made up. It’s all disinformation, just like they put an ad in about football, just like they put with respect to me. I’m the one that got football back, and I was always against them going out. It was ridiculous, that Big 10. And now, hopefully PAC 10 goes back. And I say that just like even worse, they put out a totally fake ad, totally made up story. It was a made up story by a third rate magazine, where the head guy I guess, the head person, I have no idea who he is, I don’t know him, but he’s friends with Obama and Clinton, so they made up this horrible story, and then they did ads. Well, they made up this story too. This story is very simple. They started knocking the vaccine, as soon as they heard that this actually may come out prior to election. Now it may or may not, but it’ll be within a matter of weeks. It’ll be within a matter of weeks from November. It’s ready to go, and it’s ready to for massive distribution to everybody, with a focus again on seniors. And I will say also, the historically black colleges and universities we are doing at my suggestion, because they have had a difficult problem. There we are doing more testing, and finer testing. We have our great apparatus there. But when you look at what we’ve done on testing in terms of the technology and the amount, it’s been really amazing. In fact, I think we’re going to crack a hundred million tests very soon in the very near future. We’re going to be cracking a hundred million tests. Now, what that does do is it shows up more cases. So if we didn’t test, we wouldn’t have cases. You would have no cases. Other countries, they don’t test, they don’t have cases. And then they say, “Oh, the United States.” But we’re proud of it, because it shows where there may be a problem, and it helps people. But we’re doing tremendous testing at the historically black colleges and universities. And that was a suggestion I made, and I think it’s a good suggestion. Yeah, please, go ahead. No, he's contradicting himself. I think he misunderstood the questions. You know what I think? I think he misunderstood. I told you, I don’t have to go through this. I think he misunderstood the questions. But I’m telling you, here’s the bottom line. Distribution is going to be very rapid. He may not know that. Maybe he’s not aware of that. And maybe he’s not dealing with the military, et cetera, like I do. Distribution is going to be very rapid, and the vaccine’s going to be very powerful. It’s going to solve a tremendous problem. It’s going to be very powerful. Because of the great job we’ve done. Because of the great things we’ve done in other fields also. Because of the fact that we created ventilators, we built ventilators by the thousands, and now we’re supplying to the world. Because of all of the incredible work we’ve done for governors who are on every call saying, “This is incredible. This is great. This is great.” Sometimes they’re not quite as friendly at a news conference when you have people covering it. But we have done a phenomenal job on COVID-19, as they like to call it. I call it other things. But we have done a phenomenal job. I get calls from other people in other countries; they can’t believe the job we’ve done. And then they’ll say, “Is there any way that you could get us ventilators?” I say, “How many do you need?” “1000 ventilators.” I said, “We’ll be able to take care of it.” We’re making thousands of ventilators, very complex, very expensive, very difficult thing to make. We’re making thousands a month. The cupboard was bare when I got here, and I will tell you, our distribution is going to be very rapid, and it’s going to be all encompassing. We are going to have a focus on certain groups that have problems, senior citizens, et cetera, but it’s going to be a very powerful distribution. It’s going to cover everybody, and it’s going to cover them rapidly. I don’t know whether or not the doctor knows that, how much he covers, but I called him. Because I said, “Why did you say that long?” He wasn’t that aware of it. And the other one was the mask. The vaccine is going to have tremendous power. It’s going to be extremely strong. It’s going to be extremely successful. We’re not going to have a problem. And the mask may help, and I hope it helps, and I think it probably does. But again, the mask is a mixed bag. There are some people, professionals, Scott, you would know a lot of them, but there are some people that don’t like the mask because of the touchiness and the touching, and then you’re touching everything else. They feel that masks have problems. So anyway, go ahead, in the back, please. I do. I do. He I think maybe misunderstood a question. But we’re beyond that now. We’re really in final stages of vaccines. We’re getting ready to go phase one on distribution. And I think it might come out even sooner than you think. I think the vaccine’s going to be even better than people thought originally. I think people are going to be really surprised at the success of the vaccine. I think it’s going to be a tremendous success. And we’re fighting a very powerful party with a poor candidate, in my opinion. But we’re fighting a very, very powerful party and they’re partners with the media, and because they’re working together very closely. And when they hit on the vaccine, they only hit on it when they realized that, wow, this is amazing, they may have it even before the election. All of a sudden they didn’t like the vaccine so much. In the back please. I cannot hear you, I'm sorry. Today? Say it. Oh I see, about the staff? I heard about it this morning. At a very small level, yes, I heard about it this-I don’t know. We can have a report to you if you feel it’s necessary. Last night I heard about it for the first time, and it’s a small number of cases. Maybe it’s not even cases. Do you know, do you have any idea if there’s-Yeah, that's okay. And it’s not anybody that was near me. From what I heard, a very small number. I think you can probably give the number out later on when you find out what it might be. One person? It was one person, okay? It was one person. So not a person that I was associated with. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you.
















"
"62","09-17-20","Thank you, thank you very much. Thank you very much. That is a beautiful site right behind me, isn’t it? That’s a beautiful site. Thank you very much. And a very big hello, Wisconsin, we’ve been very good together. And I’m thrilled to be with thousands of loyal, hard-working American patriots. 47 days from now, we’re going to win Wisconsin and we’re going to win four more years in the White House. This is the most important election in the history of our country. I feel that way so strongly, so do you. Joe Biden devoted his entire career to offshoring Wisconsin jobs, outsourcing your factories, throwing open your borders, dragging us into endless ridiculous foreign wars and surrendering your children’s future to China. You know what he’s been doing? I just see he’s up there tonight getting softball questions from Anderson Cooper. They don’t ask me questions like that. And the audience isn’t quite like this. Do you see what his audience … they’ve got cars. They have car in a parking, it’s the weirdest thing I’ve ever seen. And CNN is going, “Oh, this is so beautiful.” It’s not beautiful. They have cars in a parking lot. What a deal, I’ll tell you, what a deal. Biden’s supported every disasterous global sellout for half a century, including a NAFTA, China. You take a look at China’s entry into the World Trade Organization and TPP. He supported them all, Biden, surrendered your jobs to China and you know that. I probably wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for that, it was one of the big things, one of the big reasons I decided to say to my great wife, our first lady, let’s go have some fun. Let’s go have some fun. She’s done a great job and very popular. And the family is all over the place, all over the country. But unlike Joe, who lets you down when he’d never even came back to Milwaukee to apologize or just to pay respects, I came to Wisconsin and I’ve been here a lot since, since we started this, a lot. And you’ve been a tremendous beneficiary of what I’ve done and I have to, because you’ve been with me, you’ve supported me and we’ve had great victories together, all victories, so I want to thank you. Now Biden wants to surrender our country to the violent left-wing mob. You see what’s happening. If Biden wins very simple, China wins. If Biden wins, the mob wins. If Biden wins, the rioters, anarchists, arsonists, and flag burners, they win and we’re not into flag burners. We don’t like flag burners. I’d like to say, pass a law, one year in jail, you started burning flags, we put you in jail for a year. We should do that. They would have done that, it’s a different world, I guess, but it’s sort of coming back to the way we have to have it because we’re for law and order. They say, don’t use that term, it’s too tough. No, everybody wants law and order. Minorities want law and order. Everybody wants law and order. They have to have it. I’m running for the reelection and a very important reelection to bring jobs in factories back and that’s a continuation. Because I don’t know if you know it, the single greatest year Wisconsin has ever had was last year. The second best year that Wisconsin has ever had was the year before. And guess what the third was the year before that? And you’re going to have your best year economically next year, it’s all heading in that direction despite the pandemic given to us by China. We want to put the violent criminals behind bars and we have to ensure the future belongs to America, not to China, not to other very terrible forces out there, because if we win, very simply America wins. And that’s what we want, we want this great country to win. Over the last three and a half years, we’ve secured America’s borders. Fixed the disastrous trade deals, they have been the worst ever. Not even … it was not even … when I looked at these, I studied them and I used to talk about them, they had to be bad. When I started studying, I said, “Who are the people that made these deals?”2 Grossly incompetent people. Brought back our manufacturing jobs, rebuilt the awesome power of the U.S. military and obliterated the ISIS caliphate. We open obliterated it. Obama was not able to do it, he wasn’t able to come close. It was just announced that in 2019, before the virus came in from China, we grew median income by a record of $4,400 in just one year, achieving the highest median income in U.S. history. That’s in the history of our country. In the first three years, we lifted six point six million people out of poverty, the largest poverty reduction of any president in the history of our country. That’s not bad. And I didn’t even make these numbers up. These are numbers that … they sound good to me. We built the greatest economy in the history of a world. This is the greatest economy in the history of the world. And then the virus came in, we closed it down, we saved millions and millions of lives. We’d be at two and a half million, two million, three million. A number that would not be sustainable, would not be acceptable. A horrible number, there shouldn’t have been one person that died. It should have been stopped at China. They stopped it for their country, but it came out to us, to Europe, to the rest of the world, 188 countries. We will deliver a safe and effective vaccine before the end of the year. And it could be very, very soon. You’ve been seeing what’s going … could be very, very soon. Could be, it’s amazing how all of a sudden they hate the vaccine. When they thought it couldn’t be done, they said, “Well, he’s got to get a vaccine.” And then all of a sudden, they’re looking like it’s going to be very close. We’re doing great. We’re doing great with vaccines and therapeutics, Remdesivir, all sorts of other things that are bringing the rates down, like at numbers that nobody can believe. But we have three vaccines right now, they’re in the final stage, clinical trials. We worked it for the FDA where they approved it fast. They went very fast, very quick, at levels that nobody else could have ever achieved. No other administration, certainly the last one, because the last one was grossly incompetent. In fact, that’s why I’m here, because if it was good, I wouldn’t have run. If they did their job, I wouldn’t have run. I was very happy in my other life. I was very happy, but I’m very happy in this life. More happy, because nobody has produced in three and a half years, the first three and a half years, nobody has done what we have been able to do, nobody. So we’ll defeat the virus and next year will be truly, I think, from an economic standpoint and from other standpoints, maybe the best year of all. Hard to believe we’re going so fast, the numbers have been incredible. We’ve had employment numbers, the best ever. We’ve had retail sales numbers the best ever. You see them all, they come out every day. And our stock market is for the most part, at a new high. And if people have 401ks, if you want to have your 401k go down like to depression levels, I think you should vote for sleepy Joe, because he’s going to raise your interest. He’ll be raising your interest rates. I watch him though, he’s denying all this up. Everything that he said, he’s now denying. He said, no fracking, right? There will be no fracking during the … he didn’t know what fracking was, but he said there’s no fracking. The reason is because everybody else, all of the radical left candidates up there, they couldn’t get too far left, so Joe agreed. Then he gets the nomination, now they’re all angry. You know that crazy Bernie, all of the left democrats, they don’t want to vote for him anymore because he made promises and now all of a sudden he forgot that he said no fracking. He said, “Well, now we can do some fracking.” But remember this in politics, it’s always the thing that they say first, that’s what they’re going to do. No guns, no religion, no energy, no oil, remember that. Remember, he put Beto in charge of his gun policy, right? Beto, crazy Beto. Remember when Beto went out, he said, “I was born for this.” And that’s when it all came down. As soon as I heard that, anybody said they were born for this, that doesn’t play well. But he’s in charge of the Second Amendment. And you won’t have a Second Amendment. Frankly, you wouldn’t have a Second Amendment if I didn’t get elected, it would have been obliterated. It would have been torn up. Maybe it would have been totally knocked out. But there’s tremendous pressure on your Second Amendment. As long as I’m here, you’ll always have a Second Amendment. But I want to just say, they do disinformation, they make up a phony story and then they go with it. They make up a totally phony story. It’s called disinformation. And one of the things, oh, what they did, the worst of all was the soldiers. Because, nobody loves our soldiers like I do and they made up a phony deal. And that’s why I say the gloves are off because when they do that, that’s worse than what I’m going to talk to you about, that’s big 10. You know we got it back, right? We got big 10. But the soldier story, about standing over their graves, you know the one I’m talking about, then they do a commercial. And I said, the good news about that is the gloves are off. I can now call him grossly incompetent, the man is incompetent. He’s been there for 47 years, he didn’t do a thing. Now all of a sudden, in years where he was never considered smart, but now he’s really not considered smart. And now all of a sudden he’s going to do what he never did in 47 years. He’s got to do this and that and everything that I’m doing, everything that we’re doing. But I want to congratulate the big 10 conference on yesterday’s announcement that the fall season will start very soon. Oh, I hope your team does well after all that. I hope that team does well. But I especially want to thank a football legend, he was great. Wisconsin’s own Barry Alvarez, he was great. Good, got to be careful when you do that, a lot of times you don’t like people too much. They say, “Oh,” but he’s a good man. We worked with him. We worked with a whole group, including the commissioner of the league, did a very, very good job, did a very good job. But we called them, and the reason is that they took an ad. In other words, another one, disinformation. They took an ad saying I was against football. I’m the one that said they shouldn’t close. But I said that, if they close, they close. But then they took an ad saying I’m the one, I didn’t want it. I wanted it closed. So then I said, “Well, no, I don’t. I want it open. Let me call up the commissioner.” We called up the commissioner and he was great. He said, “You really think so?” And bottom line, we worked very hard, lots of calls to lots of different states, lots of people. We dealt with the players, the parents of the players, who are really the boss, that’s okay, I won’t say that. But these are players that have a shot at the NFL. They have a shot at pro-football. We want the NFL to proudly stand when they sing our National Anthem. Or their ratings are going to continue to go down like they did last weekend, down 27%. Because people don’t want that. You know what, we have enough politics, right? We have politics here. We have politics all over. In fact, sometimes I have to turn it off. I can’t do it anymore. I can’t watch me. It’s always … I can’t watch me. I can’t watch. But no, we have enough politics. We don’t want to watch now on Sunday, all, here we go again with the politics, let them play football, let them stand and salute or put your hand on your heart and be proud of our country and be proud of our great American flag. And then go home to the mansion and have a good time. Take a nice sauna and then if you want, after you recover, you come out and you go and you do your thing, whatever the thing may be. But people don’t want to see it and the ratings are down. Here we go again. I thought we taught them that lesson two years ago. Didn’t we think? I thought we taught that lesson. But Biden would absolutely eradicate your state’s economy. I know this state very well. It’s one of the reasons I made the great deal with Canada and Mexico, but Canada, because they were taking advantage of you so badly on your dairy products. You had a 287% tariff on your dairy products with Canada. People don’t realize Canada is one of the toughest negotiators and they treated your state and this country very unfairly until I came along, very, very unfairly. Did you know that? 287. But I saw some farmers and this was like the straw that broke the camel’s back. They had something called specialty milk. Does anybody know what that is? Right, you know. A lot of people … it’s a small little grouping of milks, specialty milk. But this was the final straw. And I met some people and Canada finally did it to them like they did it to everybody else. And they raised a tariffs massively, they made it impossible. They tried to take over that business too, along with all of them, it was just massive and horrible what they did. And that really got me going, the little specialty milk, specialty products, a small portion, but you know what, that was it. And we have a great deal. The USMCA is a great deal and I’m very honored to have done it. But it was all because of specialty milk and the way you were taken advantage of by Canada. You know, they have the wonderful, Oh, Canada, we love to hear the song, right? But let me tell you, they are very tough. And they’ve taken advantage of our country for many, many years. And I will tell you this, they’re not so happy now, but at least they got a deal, but you’re happy. And it’s about time you were happy. You now have a great deal and you’re not going to have your companies leaving for Mexico anymore or Canada. And you’re not going to have them make your product in Mexico or Canada, send it over here with no tariff, with no tax. Where we lose tax, we lose jobs, we lose our companies, we lose everything. And they make a lot of money selling the product to us, same product. So we’re not doing that stuff anymore. There’s a tremendous disincentive, it’s called, like, let’s not do it. And you haven’t seen that lately. You haven’t seen too many companies leaving have you? It’s sort of an amazing thing. It’s a little bit like what we did with the statues. So on the statutes, they were knocking them down three or four months ago. I said, “Do we have any laws? No, but there was a very old law.” I said, “What was it?” You get 10 years in jail, 10 years in prison, they actually use the word prison, which is a tough word. You get 10 years in prison if you knocked down a statue or a monument. I said, “Let me see that law, I want to see that law.” Right, Glen, right? I want to see that law. Where’s Duffy, is he there too? Look at the guy, he’s climbing trees tomorrow. And Rachel, oh Rachel, he was a good climber, you think he could climb up a tree faster than me? I think so. So I just want to tell you, so what we’ve done in a very, very short period of time is what nobody thought. And we came in and we did it and we did it for you. And we did it for everybody. We did it for our country, but we wouldn’t have a country left. What was happening to our country, how we were taken advantage. Now we have to get four more years to cement it and to do additional things, including tax cuts. They’re going to raise your taxes. They’re going to raise your taxes very substantially. We’re cutting your taxes. We got you the biggest tax cut in history, and we’re going down lower and it’s called-Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. So big tax cuts, big regulation cuts. The Democrats, they want to … the Democrats, they want to just really break us down in terms of our competitive ability to compete with other nations. Do you notice what’s happening with Japan? You notice what’s … We have taken billions and billions of dollars in from China. We charge them a fortune. In fact, many farmers in this group, because you got to love Trump. I gave you $28 billion, right? Thank you very much, China, right? You were targeted. 12 billion, Sonny Purdue, Secretary of Agriculture. I said, “Sonny, how much have they been hit for, targeted for?” Remember when China said we’re not going to do anything, we’re not buying. They thought they were going to put pressure on us. Sonny said, “Sir, 12 billion, the year before last and last year was 16, total of 28 billion.” We took 28 billion out of the tariffs. China never paid us 25 cents, not 25 cents with Obama and Biden. And in all fairness with no president, they paid us nothing. They pay us now tens of billions of dollars. I took a small portion of it, I added it up, 16 and 12, 28, and I said, $28 billion is going to the farmers. Did everybody get that money, right? You had a very good year, the farmers have had a very good year. Last week, China ordered and you have to understand, I view China differently now than I did six months ago, we made a great trade deal but I view it differently because I don’t know if I can ever view it the same. But last week they know how I feel and they’re very smart. So instead of saying, we’re not going to do business, which would have been okay with me. We would have worked it out somehow, you would have been very successful, the farmers. But last week, they had the largest order of corn. Did you know this? In the history of our country. Did anyone know this, the farmers? From China, thank you very much. The largest order of soybeans in the history of our country. And one of the largest cattle orders in the history of our country, because they’re very smart. Somebody else would have said, well, let’s not do business. And then it would have been easy for me, but they gave us so much. I have every farmer calling up saying, please do me a favor. We love this. We love this. This is a great deal. It’s a great deal, but we feel differently about it, don’t we? We just feel differently about it. I don’t talk about it like I used to, I talked about it, it was great. And it turned out to be a great deal, but I don’t talk about it the same way. At no time before has there been a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies or two agendas for the future than these two parties, you got law and order on one side and you have chaos on the other. On November 3rd, Wisconsin will decide whether we will quickly return to record prosperity or whether we will allow Biden and the Democrats to impose a four trillion dollar tax hike, ban American energy, confiscate your guns, which is what they want to do. Shut down the economy, destroy the suburbs. You know they were destroying our suburbs, you know that, right? I don’t know, if somebody said, you just doing okay in the suburbs? I said, “How can I do okay, I saved the suburbs. What I’ve done is saved the suburbs.” And you know this, I don’t have to go into it, but I saved the suburbs. I think the suburbs … Last time, four years ago, “Oh, he’s not going to do well with women.” I did great with women. They said, “Well a big thing.” Remember that? Election eve, “He won’t do well … this will be a very short, not doing well with women.” I did great. They said at the end of the night, after they announced I won, they said, “What happened? Well, he did very well with women. I don’t know how it happened there.” They said he did very well with African American community. He did very well with Hispanics. They said he did very well with everything. We kicked their ass. That was [inaudible 00:24:40]. No, but was that one of the greatest evenings ever, remember? And remember all the fake news, look at all the … Oh la, that’s a lot. That’s a lot of people back there. Look at that, the red lights are on. Don’t worry, I won’t say anything bad about you CNN. Because as soon as I see, as soon as I see … As soon as I’m getting ready to say something about fake news, et cetera, et cetera, the lights start going off so I’m not going to … One just went off I think. You can tell by the lights, they got that little beautiful red light. You see it? But I won’t say anything bad about them but they are fakers and do you remember when they … Remember when they were saying that the polls are terrible. Actually these polls are very good compared … That was so bad it was like why did anybody vote. They’re called suppression polls. They make them so bad that you lose all your appetite, you lose all your spirit, they take your guts out, and you don’t go and vote, and your wife looks at you and says, “Darling I love that guy, but he’s not going to win. He doesn’t have a chance because the polls, he’s down 10, he’s down 20, he’s down 50 points, darling. He can’t possibly win. Let’s go have dinner and then we’ll come home and watch his concession speech.” But my people didn’t buy that because my people went out to vote. Instead, we watched her concession speech. Crooked Hillary, that was a real piece of work. Remember when she was saying, “Will you accept the decision of the voters? Will you accept that decision?” I wasn’t perfect, I said I’ll see how it works out. I should have said, “Yes, I will,” but I couldn’t do that because I know how crooked she is. Would you accept the decision? The anchor said to me like, “Will you accept?” They’re coming after me, I said, “You’re supposed to be going after her a little bit too.” Did you ever see debates where you had all of the anchors plus the candidates against me? Here we sit, is that Air Force One, yes, that’s Air Force One. How did that happen? A lot of the times I’d say to the anchor, I’d say, “Wait a minute. Wait a minute. This isn’t fair.” I mean I’m watching what they’re doing with Biden where he’s using teleprompters, “Move it up, move it up, I can’t see, I can’t see.” He’s shot. He’s shot. President Xi of China is not shot. Putin is not shot. Kim Jong-un, remember we’re supposed to be in a war with him, what happened to the war? No, it seems to be good. Did you see the Middle East two days ago? Remember our incompetent negotiator John Kerry? He never got up to walk. The guy’s getting beaten on every point, I say, “Walk. Walk. Get up and leave the table. You’re giving up.” They’d say, “We want this.” He’d say, “Well, I’d rather not.” “We want this.” “Okay, you got it.” “We want that.” “You got it.” “We want that.” Say no and walk. They’ll probably possibly call you back and if they don’t that’s okay too. But right now I will tell you Iran, if we win, Iran will be calling us within the first week, they’re dying to make a deal. GDP down 27%. They don’t have too much money for terror anymore, it’s actually amazing, do you notice what’s going on? Now I don’t want to speak too loud, but I did put out on social media the other day that if they hit us in any way, any form, written instructions already done, we’re going to hit them 1000 times harder than we’ve ever hit them before. So hopefully they will just come and we’ll make a deal and they’ll go back to being a rich country, let them go back and be rich but they cannot have a nuclear weapon. They cannot. That deal was so bad that Obama made. $150 billion, they got $150 billion for nothing. You know the deal is practically … If I didn’t terminate it which I’m proud to have done, but if I didn’t terminate it, they got $1.8 billion in cash, how about that? If I didn’t terminate that stupid deal, first of all you wouldn’t have the deal in the Middle East and all these countries are joining, it’s happening fast. They want to all join. We did it, you know, the reverse. We did it the … Thank you very much. Thank you very much. You know it’s interesting, thank you very much. I knew I like you. So the Nobel Peace Prize. So the funny thing, a lot of people don’t know because the fake news doesn’t write about it. So if you’re a president, right? And you are nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, you’re the United States, no, but think of this. That’s a big deal. I mean Obama got it like in his first couple of weeks and nobody knew why he got it including him, remember? He couldn’t tell you why. He had no idea. To this day, he has no idea why he got it. But if you’re a president and you get nominated, then two days later, you get nominated, did you know this, a second time, for a different deal. Kosovo. Serbia. They’ve been killing each other for hundreds of years. I stopped a lot of death and I did it like easy, it wasn’t hard for me. It’s sort of a natural thing to do but we did a good thing. But you know what? They did a check. So I got nominated twice for the Nobel Peace Prize, that’s a big deal, I don’t know. I should have gotten nominated seven times because we did a lot of other things, but these are for two different deals, and not one mention was made on the evening news. Think of it. Now when Obama got it, it was headlines, headlines. Our president just got the Nobel Peace Prize, he was just nominated, headlines. Like his first little while he got it and to this day, and frankly, he did a lousy job. He was a lousy president, he really was. His vice president, I’ll tell you what. His vice president was very good for you know who? For Hunter, where’s Hunter, where’s? Remember the quid pro quo, remember, I’m not giving them that billion dollars unless you get rid of that prosecutor [inaudible 00:31:42] I got rid of the prosecutor, here’s the billion, right? But they don’t want to play that too often. You have to look around for it. It’s a very unfair deal but as the expression goes, we won, I don’t know how the hell we did it. When you look at the opposition, when you look at how unfair it is and these guys know very well, you look at how unfair it is, it’s pretty damn good, but we have a lot of support. We have tremendous support of the people. These rallies, look at this rally. These rallies … These rallies are incredible. I will tell you, Sean [inaudible 00:32:19] gap ever polled. I’m not a believer in the polls but I believe that one. It’s the biggest enthusiasm gap, he’s got no enthusiasm. The only enthusiasm is for the people that want to beat us, they want to beat me. That’s the only thing he’s got, the people that want to … They couldn’t care less about him. He could be that piece of wood that was left in the ground. Biden will hand the left wing mob the keys to your kids’ classroom. Earlier today I took a historic stand against the hateful lies being fed to America’s youth, the parents know all about it. I checked, they’re doing it in Wisconsin too. I was a little surprised, I’m a little surprised. I’m a little surprised you let it happen actually but we’re going to get rid of it. I announced that we’re launching a new pro-American lesson plan for students called 1776 Commission. We’re going to teach our children the truth about America, that we’re the most exceptional nation ever to exist and we’re getting better every single day. Sleepy Joe Biden is wholly owned and controlled by the far left. He even opposed sending the National Guard into a place called Kenosha, did you ever hear of Kenosha? How about that, did we do a good job? I wish we did it a little sooner but we finally got your governor’s okay. We have to do that if … We got to get the governors to say please do it. How they don’t do it, how they don’t do it in some other places when you look at what’s going on with Chicago, right? When you look at what’s going on with Portland, those are just anarchists. You know how long it would take us to fix up Portland in terms of ending it all? I’d say far less than an hour, I’d say a half hour. Look what we did at Minneapolis. We’re doing well in Minnesota because they saw what happened. Now they shouldn’t have allowed it to go on for 11 days, they should have called us immediately but do you remember that beautiful night? Nice evening, a little problem, there were a lot of buildings in the background that were burning down to the ground as reporters said, “No, this is a peaceful protest.” By the way, officially, this is called a protest, you know that. We no longer call it rallies. We don’t use the term rally, okay? Rachel knows. We don’t call them rallies anymore because you’re not allowed to have a political rally for more than 10 people. You’re not allowed to go to church, you’re not allowed to meet, you’re not allowed to talk to anybody, you have to stay in a prison. Your home has become your prison and then I’m saying, “Well what are you allowed to do?” “Sir, you’re not allowed to do anything. I mean there is one thing but it doesn’t pertain to you.” “What is it?” “Well you are allowed to protest.” “Oh really? Oh.” Hence the name. We call them friendly protests. So these are protests, so it’s totally allowed. This is a protest. Remember when they walk out, when you walk outside, what do you consider this? Did you enjoy the rally? No, really, this is a protest, I’m sorry. No, [inaudible 00:35:58] I don’t know if it’s your state but a couple of them they have-You’re allowed to protest, so you can’t go to church but you can rip the hell out of the streets, of Main Street, of 5th Avenue, break up the stores. Burn down the buildings. Climb over each other’s face, you can climb right over their face. You don’t have to wear masks, you don’t have to do anything. 25,000 people walking down the street, looters, anarchists, agitators, burning down stores, throwing things at police. They’ve taken the authority away from our police, our great police. They’ve taken their authority and their dignity away. We’re giving it back, we have to, we have to. By the way, I was endorsed by New York’s finest and we’re with them all the way. I was just endorsed two days ago by Chicago Police. I think that takes courage, right? Philadelphia, Florida, Texas, everybody, Ohio. I don’t know, did anybody … Is there one group of … Even if it was a tiny little group of two or three police, did anybody endorse Sleepy Joe? I don’t think so. But we did a great job in Kenosha. We got out there, I went there as you know, a little while ago but had we not gone in that place would … It would have been burned to the ground. They did damage, we should have gone in. I wanted to go in the first night, we would have stopped it immediately but it was a great outcome as was in Minnesota. Again, if they would have called us early it would have been over. Portland, I’d love to go there. That would be so easy. You know in Seattle, they heard we were coming in, they gave up. They heard we … I said, “That’s enough. We’re going in. I don’t care. We’re going in.” “Do you have permission.” “No, we’re going in.” They took over a chunk of the city, and when they heard we were going in it’s like, “Well we give up, that’s it.” That was the end of the Settle problem. It’s a terrible thing that’s going on. All in Democratic run, super liberal run, cities. The red cities are doing great. I think we’re doing great all over, the Republican cities, we’re fair. We’re not stupid. How stupid these people are. Did you see Chicago? 48 people shot, six died. You know we’re in Afghanistan, we’re pulling the troops, you know that, we’re coming back, we’re almost finished. We’re pulling … Finally, these endless wars. These endless wars, and we had to fight other things but we’ve done a great job but we’re acting like a police force over there. No, we’re pulling the troops, we’re almost out of Iraq. That’s another one, we’re down to about 2,000 troops, did you know that Sean? 2,000 troops. So Syria, we’re out but we kept the oil so we have some … Was it okay that we at least kept the oil? I feel badly because we have some troops … “Well you haven’t pulled the troops.” No no, we’re gone, we pulled all the troops out of Syria. Remember we were supposed to be guarding the border between Syria and Turkey? I said, “Why are we doing that?” They said, “Well, we are.” I said, “Wait a minute, we have an army of 100,000 here, an army of 25,000, 30,000 here. We got 5,000 soldiers. That’s a very dangerous position to be in.” I don’t like it. They’ve been guarding their own borders with different names for a thousand years. Why the hell do we have to be over there guarding their border? We want to guard our own borders, right, where we’re doing very well. Where we’re doing very well. We’re doing great on our southern border, I hate to say this, but that wall is going up very rapidly, 10 miles a week. We’re up to 330 miles and the wall will be finished very soon. You think that was easy, that was not easy, our great congressman over here, that was not easy. The Democrats were totally in favor of the wall until I said when I came in, “We will build the wall.” As soon as I said it, they were against the wall. They said, “We don’t want you to build the wall. Walls don’t work.” I said, “No no, walls always work.” You know what else works? The wheel. The wheel and the wall, you can go back. Come back in 1,000 years from now. The only two things I know for sure, you’re going to have a wheel and you’re going to have a wall. The computers, they come up with a brand new computer, it’s genius, 12 days later, it’s obsolete. But walls are never obsolete, neither are wheels. So I made one mistake and I tell this to these guys because they were great warriors for me, the congressmen. They were incredible actually. I tell it to them. I should have said instead of we will build the wall, we will build the wall, we will build … Then the Democrats held us up and fought us and sued us and everything else and now we won so many lawsuits on the wall and we had the military money, I can build like 10 walls with all the money we have. It’s the craziest thing. Maybe we’ll build it double thick or we’ll go twice as high. No, but the wall is great. Everything, everything, that they wanted, but I made one mistake. I should have said, “We will not build a wall.” Then they would have insisted that we build it, I could have saved two years of litigation. “We will not build a wall under any circumstances.” Then Pelosi would say, “We demand that you build a wall.” These people are terrible. Crazy Nancy, crazy as a bedbug. She’s crazy as a bedbug. She decided to make a nice little stop-in at the beauty parlor, how did that work out? Not too good, it didn’t work out too well. Can you imagine? The owner of the beauty parlor is a MAGA lady, she loves Trump. Can you believe it? I don’t know what it is but I think if I owned a beauty parlor, I had a customer, I’m not sure I’d be turning her in. The owner turned Nancy in. That’s a lot of hate. That’s serious hate, right? No, she’s a great owner. As far as I’m concerned, I think she’s fantastic. She’s for us. They said, “What made you do it?” You know what she said, “Because I see how hard our president has to work. I see what they put him through. I see what he puts with and I turned her in.” How about that? How about that? We love her. She can do my hair anytime. I think I’m going to call her in. Check it out, maybe you can do something. Maybe you can improve it, it’s not bad though. I have friends that … I have friends my age, they’re not looking too good. Instead of standing up for America, Joe Biden and the Democrats, they condemn America and war is always waged on our great law enforcement. We love our law enforcement. Kamala Harris, that’s another great beauty, Kamala Harris, that’s a beauty. Remember, I tell this story all the time. When you pick somebody, you pick somebody that’s hot, that’s going in the right direction, right? She came out, she was at like 14, 15 in the polls, and she started going down, down, down, it never stopped. It drove her crazy. She was terrible at the debates. Wait till you see what Mike Pence does to her in the debates, but I don’t want to put … I don’t want to put pressure on Mike. Do we have a great vice president? Is he good? He’s great, and he loves this state. Loves all the states actually. He’s just a great American but do you remember his last debate? What he did to that character from Virginia? That one wasn’t good. The other guy’s jumping around, Mike is just sitting there, we love America, we’re going to lower your taxes. Thank you, you win. No, Mike is great. But Kamala Harris and 13 members of Biden’s staff urged their supporters to donate to a fund to bail out rioters, take them out of jail, get them out of jail as soon as possible. Including one who attempted to murder a police officer, a man who was accused of sexually assaulting an eight-year-old girl. This is what we’re dealing with. This is what we’re dealing with. You know Kamala was considered, is considered further left than Crazy Bernie, think of that. They got there … I mean seriously, watch. You know the manifesto that Biden and … It’s not Biden, Biden has not agreed to anything. His people, his representatives, because Biden doesn’t know he’s alive, let’s not kid ourselves. Biden. Biden didn’t agree, he didn’t, they just told him what’s happening. They said, “Listen, you’re against fracking but now you have to be in favor of fracking because you lucked out. Elizabeth Warren decided not to drop out and when she stayed,” Pocahontas, you know Pocahontas? Did anybody ever hear of her? She’s another great one. Pocahontas. I said to her a long time ago, I’ve got more Indian blood in me than you do and I have none, I have none. Sadly. I’d love a little bit of it, but I have none, I said … I turned out to be right. She choked and she went for a blood test. Remember? Was it 1024th? Meaning maybe nine hundred years ago, there was a little action going on. Crazy Pocahontas, she’s a nasty one though, isn’t she? She’s a terrible person. I was hoping that she’d win so we could go after her because I think Kamala is not as smart but she’s a little bit less vicious. I think this. The one who treated Sleepy Joe the worst was Kamala. She accused him of MeToo, she accused him of everything. She accused him of … That he was a racist, right? That he was a racist? Because what he’s done to the black population of this country was a terrible thing. She’s accused him of everything under the book, the busing, remember, the busing scandal. So I said brilliantly he’ll never pick her because she was too terrible to him. She was the worst of everybody. By far, I would say, but she picked him and hopefully that’s going to be history, it’s not going to matter, and that is no way for a woman to become the first president, that’s for sure. If a woman is going to become the first president of the United States, it can’t be her. That would rip our country apart. This is not what people want and she comes in through the backdoor, this would not be what people want, especially because it’s her. Biden has called to end cash bail, you know that right, for vicious criminals? Meaning if you assault a copy or anybody else, you’re right back on the street the next day. He called for police and he calls them all the time the enemy. He says they’re the enemy and he just thinks it’s terrible. He think it’s terrible. Now he’s liking the police much more. It’s a little late. Remember, first instinct, that’s where they’re going, and he has no choice because he has to, because again, I was going to say, the radical left hates him because they think he deceived them because they agreed on that manifesto and that manifesto is seriously a leftist dream and he agreed from the Green New Deal, getting rid of your planes. No more airplane trips. Remember the crazy senator from Hawaii? “Do you like the Green New Deal?” “I love it very much,” he said. Oh okay, well you’re the senator from Hawaii, that’s right, the beautiful island of Hawaii. She said, “Under the Green New Deal you basically can’t fly in an airplane.” “Oh that’s a problem.” So they said they’d build a bridge from the mainland to Hawaii. It’s 2,000 miles long but these are minor details. Remember her when they explained to her that planes are out, cows are out. Cows, they don’t want cattle, they don’t want cows. Did they withdraw that one? That was a tough one, wasn’t it? They don’t want cows, bad for the ozone layer. Who would even think of that? You’d got to be sick to even think it, okay? Give me a break. Give me a break and I guess under that theory this big guy is next, he’s next. No, it’s a sick deal going on there. To do it the way they want would cost $100 trillion. That’s more money than this country could earn in 1,000 years to do it right. ” We don’t like that building, the windows are too large.” “Okay, let’s rip it down and build a new one.” What windows are you going to have? You’re not going to have windows anymore. Environmental. They love wind too, right? The big windmills, I always say, the greatest graveyard in the world for birds, just walk under a windmill. You will see more dead birds than you will ever imagine, what’s happening, including eagles. You know, in California they put you in jail if you shoot a bald eagle, right? You go to jail, right? These windmills are knocking them out of the sky all day long. It’s unbelievable, and yet they want wind, and wind also is very, it’s very hard to store the electricity from wind. So if you go home and you want to watch television because President Trump is on and you want to watch one of his very brilliant State of the Union addresses, if the wind isn’t blowing, the husband looks at the wife, says, “Darling, I’m sorry, you can’t watch tonight. The wind is not blowing.” “Sorry, you can’t watch tonight. The wind is not blowing.” And she looks at me, “I like the old days. It’s much better.” But the rhetoric of Biden and the radical left puts your law enforcement in serious danger. Last weekend, two Los Angeles sheriff’s deputies were ambushed and shot at point blank range. And we have everybody looking for that creep that did it. I called him an animal the other night. I said, “He’s an animal,” and we were challenged by some people on the left. “He’s not an animal. He’s a human being.” He’s not a human being. They got to find him. They got to find him. And the penalty has to be very fast, very swift and very, very severe. You can’t do that. We call for the death penalty if you kill a policeman. You know that, right? But the anti police demonstrators, they cheered and cheered when they saw this. And then they tried to stop them from even getting into the hospital. As president, I’ll always support the heroes of law enforcement and I’ll fight to ensure that criminals who murder police officers do indeed get the death penalty. They want prisoners to vote too, they wanted to. I said, “So what about the Boston bomber?” Remember Bernie Sanders? He wanted all prisoners to have. And I said, “Does that mean everybody?” “Yes.” So we sent in a question, “Does that include the Boston bomber? Is he entitled to a vote?” And even Bernie is going, “Oh man, let’s get into a different question. This is not a good question.” But we want to get that, we want to take care of it. If you look at all of the problems that we have, you look at crime, even somebody brought it up today, we’re doing a great job relative to other countries on the coronavirus. You know how many names we have? Like 22 different names. I call it the China virus. We’re doing a great job. But if you want to really see a great job, take New York and some of these other Democrat run states out of it. You’ll see numbers that are unbelievable because New York had a very, very hard time. A lot of bad things happened. But you take a few of the states out and you’ll really see numbers. But by comparison to other countries and by almost all metrics, we’ve done an incredible job, including the job of helping the world with ventilators and all of the things that we built. And I think our task force has been incredible. And Mike Pence has done a great job. Biden opposes the death penalty for cop killers or mass murderers. Biden says he wants to protect black lives, but his radical platform will cut short the lives of thousands of African American citizens. The Democrat party’s war on cops has already led to surging homicides in Democrat controlled cities. Yet Biden supports imposing these failed policies nationwide. They ask him, “What about nationwide? What about the fact that you just had your Democrat national convention?” Where, by the way, we had far many more viewers, millions and millions of more viewers. We had millions of more. I thought it was a great thing. Did anybody hear Herschel Walker that night? It was … well. You talk about a good football player. He was some player. What a great guy. But all of them, everybody. The first lady did great, Ivanka did great. They all did, they did great. We had some … and some incredible stories, some very sad stories when you look and see what happened. But Biden’s plan is to appease the domestic terrorists. My plan is to arrest the domestic terrorists. Joe Biden is a weak person. He’s always been a weak person. And that was in prime time. And prime time was 25 years ago. And let me tell you, he’s not old. I always defend him on this. I have friends that are 85, 89, 92, 95, and they’re 100%. There’s just something wrong with Joe. He’s off, okay? He’s off, and I have no problem saying it anymore when I watch the disinformation, because this is not disinformation. This is fact. If he’s elected, his radical supporters won’t just be causing mayhem on the streets, they’ll be running the Department of Justice, Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Education. And most importantly, they will put many judges on the United States Supreme Court. We can’t have that. We’ll have a totally different country; radical left judges. And that has to do with the Second Amendment. It has to do with right to life, it has to do with so many different things that will turn your world upside down. And they’ll have one, two, three or four, whoever is the next president. And hopefully, that’s going to be us. Not me, us. It’s us. But I put it, and think of this, by the end of the term, we’ll have approximately 300 brand new, great federal judges, Court of Appeals judges 300, which is a record, 300. Give or take a little, tiny bit, but 300. Nobody thought that was possible. I want to thank President Obama. He left us 142 openings. Nobody gets left one opening. A federal judgeship is a big deal. Nobody gets left any openings. He gave us 142 openings. Thank you very much. What happened? They thought Hillary was going to win, so they didn’t push it. And then they said, “Wait a minute, these polls are getting a little close at the end.” And they tried like hell to get some judges approved, but it didn’t work. That’s what happens. You got to go and you have to act fast. You got to get it done. Get it done, right? We get things done like nobody’s ever gotten it. Oh, he was a great president. He was great. He left 142 judges for the Republicans. He was a great president, right? If you are of that side of the plate of that ideology, and you had a president that left you 142 federal judgeships, I don’t think you’d rate him as doing a good job. Hey, look at what happened in Iraq, look at what happened with ISIS, look at what happened with our military, look at what happened with our vets. Our vets are better taken care of now than they’ve ever been in the history of our country, but never forget they are coming after me because I am fighting for you. And that’s true. That’s true. And we’re winning the fight and we’re winning this election. This election, we are doing well. They refuse to say it. They refuse to say it, and they hate to say it. It just drives them crazy. But that night, remember they started off by saying, “This will be a very short evening for Donald Trump.” That was Donald Trump in those days. Now, it’s President Trump. I lost all my friends because of this position. I had friends. “Hey, Don, let’s go to dinner.” “Okay. Good, Richard. I’ll go.” Hey, Don, let’s go.” “Okay, Larry. I’ll see you later. I’ll meet you at a restaurant in New York.” Everybody was nice and loose. You could have a great conversation, and you don’t want to know what we talked about. It’s just none of your business, but we were loose. All of a sudden, I’d become president of the United States. And these are a lot of … I know a lot of important people. Actually, the people I like the best are the people that are less successful because it makes you feel so powerful. I always say, never go out with a successful person. You’ll understand. But I know a lot of very successful people, very, very successful. And now they call me up, “Mr. President, sir, would you like to get together sometime?” I say, “Loosen up. Yes, call me Donald. You’ve known me for 30 years, call me Donald.” “Oh, thank you so much. Thank you, Mr. President, I appreciate it.” I lost all my friends because it’s respect for the office, let’s face it. It’s different. They used to be loose, they used to be great. You could sit back, I’m not a drinker, but you could sit back and have a drink, whatever the hell you’re drinking. And now, you can’t do that anymore. You can’t do it anymore. So I have to rely on people in Congress to be my friends. And we just happened to have a couple tonight. And one of them who’s been a great warrior and he’s doing a fantastic job, I just saw you on television by the way, Bryan. Does everybody know Bryan Steil? Bryan Steil; young, handsome, but a warrior. When the fake impeachment happened, it was a total fake, what did we finish up with the Republicans? 197 to nothing, right at the house. One night, it was a fake impeachment. I got impeached over a perfect phone call of congratulations to the president of Ukraine, who I never met before. If you’re going to do something, at least know him a little bit, right? I never met him. And then they said it was eight times, quid pro quo. That was Adam Schiff. Shifty Schiff, right? And he went before Congress and he repeated my conversation, except that he made it all up. Remember he repeated it? And then I said, “Ah, fortunately, we had that whole thing essentially recorded.” I’m glad I did, but these are very deceptive, deceiving, sick people. And I said, “Well, he lied because there was no quid pro quo.” It was a perfect conversation. But by that time it was too late because they had already embarrassed themselves by doing it. And Nancy Pelosi was all set. She loved doing it, she from day one, but she thought it was what Schiff said. When she saw the conversation, she said to her people, “What the hell did you get me into?” So they could have dropped it, but they said, “Let’s give it a shot.” So we won. And other than Mitt Romney where we lost a half of [inaudible 01:00:47]. He’s another beauty, Mitt Romney. He’s a real beauty. He couldn’t get elected dog catcher right now in Utah. So we have another great one and he’s really a friend of mine, and he’s been solid. He loves his country and he loves his state, Glenn Grothman. Glenn, thank you very much, friend. And a man who just got elected, and he’s from an area that I know very well, we did very well, we got our big, big, fat, beautiful contract that produced lots of jobs. But he was taking a legend’s place, so it’s never easy to replace a legend. That’s Duffy, in case anybody … And they was running and we did a lot of work for him, and it was great. And he reacted very well under pressure. A lot of people don’t react well under pressure. They choke, they choke. He was under a lot of pressure and he ended up winning by like 18 points. And now, he’s your congressman. He’s doing a great job. You got to vote for all these people on November 3rd, Tom Tiffany. Thank you, Tom. And we have a great congressional candidate, Derrick Van Orden. Where’s Derrick? Derrick, good luck. I hear good things, Derrick. You got my total support. I hear very good things. I could only be supportive. Our record is like 222 and three, so I don’t like to have a loss. And I support you a 100%, you know that. You have my total endorsement, all right? I hear you’re fantastic. All right. And your former congressman who I hope is making a lot of money in the private sector because he deserves it, especially his wife, Rachel deserves it, she’s just fantastic. He’s fantastic because I know he’s coming back into government in some form. He can come with us. He can stay here. He can maybe run for governor or maybe do something, Sean Duffy. Sean Duffy. No, but he was the World Champion tree climber. And I love sports, right? Anytime you know the world champion at anything, but especially that, and I’ll never forget. I was asking about it. “How was it was?” He said, well, he broke his back numerous times. He broke a lot of bones. I said, “Let me ask you a question. How much harder was it to go up the tree than down?” He said, “It was easy going up.” The hard part was coming down because if he missed, that was where the danger was, right? That was where the danger. But many times, world champion. Could you still do it today? “A little bit heavier,” he said. You got to carry a little bit more weight. That’s all right. That’s not a good sign though, right? Anyway, great job. We love having you Rachel, thank you very much. You are a friend. Fox and friends, and plenty of other places, right? A lot of personality, a lot of personality. Rachel, she’s been our friend from day one, I think from day one. And her fantastic family too. Tonight, we’re also praying for everyone in the path of Hurricane Sally. We’re out there working very hard. We are working in Florida and Alabama and Georgia. We have FEMA. We have everybody there. We just finished in … take a look, we just went to Louisiana, Texas. We’re getting hit by some big hurricanes, but we have it under control. Really good. Our coast guard has been fantastic, by the way. Unbelievable, the bravery. They go into these storms. They go into these storms. They say, “How dangerous is it?” “Sir, it’s very dangerous.” I say, “Yeah. All right.” He said, “Would you like to try it sometime?” I say, “Admiral, no, thank you. I’ll take a pass.” I think they might have a problem with me doing it, but I will tell you, they are … In Texas, they saved 16,000 people two years ago, the coast guard, US Coast Guard. I think there’s no brand to me, that’s gone up more than the US Coast Guard. So it’s great that we’re getting them new ships. Those ships are all coming in. Nice new ones, all built in the USA, beautiful ones. Most of them have already arrived. My administration will be by their side through every step. We’re working again, very, very hard in the Panhandle. The Panhandle, we love the Panhandle. It got hit hard. We spent the last four years reversing the horrible damage Joe Biden inflicted over the last 47 years. We passed record tax cuts and regulation cuts. Nobody’s ever done more, more than anybody else has ever done to keep our family farms in the family. We’ve virtually eliminated the unfair estate tax, also known as the death tax. So if you die in 100 years from now, and you have children who you love as opposed to children that you can stand … is anybody here they have children that they don’t like, or perhaps can’t stand? Because if you do, don’t listen to the rest of this. But if you have a family that you love and you have a small business or farm or whatever, they were being put out of business. They’d have to go and borrow the money to pay the estate tax, the death tax. And it was a terrible thing. We got rid of it, so now you can leave your farm, your small business to your family. And just hope they remember you every once in a while. It’s always a difficult situation, but it was. It was ruining farms. They’d have to go out and sell the farm, they’d have to go out and get partnerships, they’d have to go out and borrow money from banks. And then all of a sudden they’re in foreclosure proceedings and they’ve never done that before. They don’t have to worry about that anymore. If you love your family, that’s a big deal. They’ve been trying to get that, Sean, for what, 30 years they’ve been trying to get that, right? Especially for the farmers, because it’s that kind of a business. It’s a great business, but it’s day to day. You have a bad crop, all of a sudden you can’t pay interest on a loan to pay your state tax, right? And they lose their farm. So we’re not going to have that anymore. We achieved American energy independence for the first time. Totally independent. We don’t have to be in those far away places unless we want to be. Biden pledged to abolish American oil, American jail, clean coal, natural gas. He said the fracking, I told you that, but we’re not going to let him get away. We’ll be bringing that up on occasion. For 47 years, Joe Biden crushed the dreams of Wisconsin workers and enriched foreign countries. That’s what happened. Before I got here, what was happening with Japan? And we pay our deep respects to Prime Minister Abe of Japan, a great friend of all of ours, a great friend of mine. He’s going to be leaving office very soon, like in a matter of a day. And he was a great gentleman. He’s a tough negotiator, I’ll tell you that. He made very good deals against the United States, but he’s somebody that’s going to be missed. He’s a great gentleman. He championed every special interest, Biden, every special interest. And he sold out on trade. He sold out like almost nobody ever before. Earlier this year, I kept my promise to American workers when we ended the NAFTA nightmare and signed the brand new US-Mexico-Canada Agreement into law. I saved the US auto industry by withdrawing from the last administration’s job killing catastrophe, the Trans-Pacific Partnership. You ever hear of that beauty? That would have really hit you. In 2017, I signed a historic executive order making government policy to buy American and hire American. I’m watching this Biden and he’s got his sign in front, “Buy American. Oh, by American.” I’ve been saying that for like 20 years, right? Where the hell has this guy been? They were actually accusing him of plagiarism. I also took the toughest ever action to stand up to China’s rampant theft of Wisconsin jobs. And it’s all jobs, but you got hit particularly hard. Biden has vowed to remove those tariffs and allow China to resume its pillaging. He wants to take the tariffs off that are paying us tens of billions of dollars a year. I fought like hell to keep them into the China deal and he wants to remove them. So tens of billions of dollars, billions and billions, I gave it to the farmers. I gave it to a lot of people, but I gave most of it by far, to the US Treasury. He wants to take them off. So let me just ask you just a very innocent question. There’s a young man, about four years old up front, I think he could give the answer. Who do you think would like to have China? How do you think China would feel about this election? In one case, they paid billions and billions of dollars a month to the US. We never got ever, 25 cents from China. In the other case, he said, “We’re going to take them off.” I think they might be inclined to go for Sleepy Joe. This is like a dream for China. Joe Biden’s agenda is made in China. My agenda is made in the USA. It’s very simple. So we did many things. Not only China, not only the $28 billion farmers. We did so much and I’m proud to announce that I’m doing even more to support Wisconsin farmers. Starting next week, my administration is committing an additional, you’ve been asking for this for a long time, $13 billion in relief to help farmers recover from the China virus, including Wisconsin’s incredible dairy, cranberry and ginseng farmers who got hurt badly. Been after that money for a long time. When the Wisconsin timber industry was threatened, I imposed tariffs on dumped foreign timber and subsidized products, saving many, many timber jobs in your state. If Joe Biden gets in, the radical left will shut down Wisconsin’s timber production for environmental reasons. Do you believe that? Oh, boy. It’s so sad to see it, and that would happen. But we can’t let that happen. We’ve come too far. We’re so good. If that virus hadn’t hit us, and it did, and it hit the whole world, but if it hadn’t hit us, we would have numbers the likes of which nobody thought were even remotely possible. But it did, and we saved a lot of lives. They keep saying, “Oh, they just …” By the way, if we had two people die, they would have said he did a terrible job. If we had 100 people die, if we had 1000, no matter what we do. We have trade deals. We announced a trade deal, everybody is saying how great it is. Schumer and Pelosi see it, they have no idea what the deal is, “We don’t like the deal.” Did you look at it? “Oh, of course, we looked at it. It doesn’t have tariffs. Oh no, it does have tariffs.” They know nothing about the deal. Automatically, anything we do, they just take the reverse. But you know what? I’d probably do it to them too, so I can’t complain. And perhaps no issue have our opponents more thoroughly betrayed working families of all backgrounds than on the subject of immigration. Under my administration, we’ve achieved the most secure border in American history. We ended the catch and release. You know what catch and release is? You catch up them, they may be a killer, they may be a criminal at the highest order, you take their name. Then you’re supposed to bring them to a court, like Perry Mason, right? But we actually catch them, take their name, release them, say, “Come back in about four years for your court case.” We ended all this stuff. And you think that was easy? It wasn’t easy, let me tell you. It was tough, but we have a really good, secure border. And the president of Mexico has been terrific. We right now have 27,000 soldiers from Mexico guarding our border, free of charge. We stopped asylum fraud, and we’ve deported 20,000 gang members and over a half a million criminal illegal aliens of the worst kind. We’re enforcing the clear requirement that newcomers to our country must be financially self-sufficient and not reliant on welfare. They have to sign a document. We invested $2. 5 trillion in the US military, including major contracts to build new warships that helped save the historic shipyard in Marinette. How about that? I was there two months ago. Marinette. That’s a great company, but it was having a hard time. And now, they’re building, what was that, like $6 billion worth of ships? And their beauties. They’ve started already, and we worked very hard on that. And we had a lot of help from your congressman on that one, because a lot of people wanted that contract. But we got it for Wisconsin, remember that. We launched the first new branch of the United States Armed Forces in nearly 75 years. That’s right, the Space Force. The fact is, and somebody said it on the other side, an opponent said whether you like it or not, Trump actually did more as president than he promised during the campaign. Like Space Force, that’s a big deal. Think of it; army, navy, air force, marines, Coast Guard, right. Think of it. I mean, that’s all you heard your whole life, right. The Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Marines, Coast Guard; and now, we have the Space Force. You know what a big deal, first time in 75 years, it’s a new one. Last one was 75 years ago. The Air Force, right. That’s a big thing. I never talked about that on the campaign, I never even thought about it. When I became president, I said, “We have to do this.” Because I saw what Russia was doing, and I saw what China was doing. And, they’ve created their Space Forces, I said, “What are we going to do?, not have it.” It’s going to end up being maybe your most important or certainly one of your most important because that’s where it’s at, in terms of defense, in terms of offense. We passed VA choice and VA accountability for our great veterans that we had the other day. Veterans satisfaction, 91 percent, the highest score we’ve ever received. You haven’t noticed, remember years ago, every story, every night, the Nightly News, you’d always have horrible stories about the VA, you don’t see it anymore. Now, I don’t want to give them any ideas, because they’ll search all over the country for a vet who’s unhappy. I’m hurting myself by telling this story. This is not a good story. But remember that, every night you’d have these horror stories about the VA. You don’t see that anymore. 91 percent approval rating. I kept my promise recognized the Capital of Israel and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem. I recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights and we achieve the first breakthrough in the Middle East peace; and, you saw that two days ago, UAE, Bahrain, Israel, nobody thought it was even possible. I saw John Kerry on television the other day. “It is not possible.” Then we waited a little while. He went very, very strong, “It is not possible.” And, it was not only possible, we have many countries that are joining us very soon. We killed the founder and the leader, the vicious leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi, we killed him. And, we also took out the world’s number one terrorist and the mass murder of American troops and many, many troops and many people, all over the world. Qasem Soleimani is dead, he’s dead, bad guy, bad guy, very bad guy. We kept America out of new wars and we’re bringing our troops back home. No one has been more wrong, more often than sleepy Joe Biden. He voted for the Iraq War, he supported the defense sequester that gutted our military. I took over a military that was totally depleted, like. Hillary Clinton deleted, as opposed to depleted, she depleted them too; but, she deleted 33,000 emails. When is somebody going to pull the spring? Ah, come on fellows. No, that’s terrible. 33,000 emails. Try going to court sometime on a civil case, and when you go before the judge, he’ll say, “Did you delete those emails?” “Did you get rid of those texts?” “Did you this…, Right.” And, now they caught Weissmann and all these guys cleaning their phones because they were under investigation, and they cleaned their phones. How many were there? 21, but they were like 33 phones. And yet, look what they do to General Flynn, and some of these people that did nothing. They cleaned their criminals, yeah, that’s criminal, it’s criminal, they’re criminals. They talk and talk and talk, they’re criminals. They clean their phone, so you don’t have any of the information, but that’s a big problem for them, I would imagine. It’s a disgrace that they can do it. But, Hillary got rid of… She deleted and acid-wash, right. Who acid-washed? Did you ever… And, she also used to bang them with a hammer, remember that, we forgot that, right. So, let’s see what happens with all of that stuff. I think Bill Barr’s doing an excellent job, I have to tell you. And, he’s fighting a very bad establishment in Washington. There’s some bad apples in that whole deal. But, if you think that Biden opposed the mission to take out of Osama bin Laden, he was against it. He opposed the killing of Soleimani. He oversaw the rise of ISIS, what a mistake. And, he cheered the rise of China as a very positive development for America and the world, I don’t think so. I don’t think so. It’s not been too positive. If it were up to sleepy, Joe Biden, bin Ladin and Soleimani, would be alive. ISIS would still be on the rampage and China would now be the dominant power in the world and there not even close, I will tell you. We have weaponry, the likes of which nobody’s seen. 2.5 trillion buys you some good stuff, especially when we have the finest scientific minds and military minds in the world. We have weapons, the likes of which nobody’s seen, and just hope to God, we never have to use them. I say that, and I say, it’s strongly. Hope that we never have to use them. My attitude was that, and I’ve learned this a long time ago, by having them, we keep ourselves out of war, as opposed to bringing ourselves in war. But, we have built and created weapons, the likes of which this world has never seen before. And, we don’t have to talk about it too much, nor do I really want to talk about it. When I ban travel from China, Biden called it hysterical and xenophobic, he said, “He’s xenophobic.” What does that mean? Joe, tell me. Biden also opposed my plan to ban Europe, I saw what was happening in France and Spain and Italy, and highly infected, we banned Europe. If we had insisted and listened to Joe and insisted on doing what so many other people said doing, which is, “You don’t have to do the ban.” Hundreds of thousands of more Americans would have died from the plague. Biden was willing to sacrifice American lives, on the altar of open borders. And now, I hear him talking, he should have followed me. This guy did the swine flu, right, it was a catastrophe. And, the man that headed up the swine flu, I won’t use his name because I’d like to have him have a nice evening, because I can’t imagine the democrats are thrilled. He said, “It was a horrible job, we had no idea what we were doing, it was a disaster.” He said, “It was a disaster.” And now, Biden’s telling us how to do what we’re doing so well on, what other countries are calling me and congratulating me on the incredible job. And I got sleepy, Joe Biden, trying to tell me how to do it. And, his own man who headed it up, swine flu, it’s H1N1 swine flu. Joe called it, N1H1. I keep saying Joe, Joe, it’s H1N1, right. I said, “It’s easier to remember because H comes before N,” but he can’t do it. And then, you saw what he said the other day under a Harris-Biden administration. That was a disaster. I never said under a Pence Trump administration, he said, “Under a Harris-Biden administration.” And, what made it worse, is she said the same thing. That was terrible, right. Sean, right. Did you hear that? They are a disaster together. Through our historic relief programs, we saved more than 1 million Wisconsin jobs and 87,000 Wisconsin businesses, that’s not too bad. And, Biden would demolish all of those games, and we’ve done similar things in other states. He would destroy your social security, totally destroy it, and destroy protections for preexisting conditions. They want to go to social medicine, they want to go to social… You know that, right. You do know that. They want social healthcare where you don’t… Remember Obama 28 times, you can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan, that didn’t work out too well, right. Why haven’t they looked into that one, 28 times. Well, under Medicare for All, but it’s basically socialized healthcare, you will never have your doctor, you will never have your plan. You’ll have horrible healthcare. You’re going to wait long times, long times. And, he wants to wipe out 180 million private healthcare plans that people love, 180 million plans. I don’t think so. I don’t think he’s going to make it. How do you get elected? Let’s say you’re doing, not only here, let’s say Texas, right, he’s against oil, he’s against God and he’s against guns. That’s a tough combination in Texas. How does that apply? Now, he’s against religion. They won’t open these blue states, they will not open your churches. They won’t open them. And, I think they have an ulterior motive. One thing they have is, probably everything opens on November 4th, you understand that. And, they better be careful, those paper ballots you talk about, a bad thing, just get out and vote, get out and vote. And, if you have to go that route, make sure they have it counted. And, they know it’s trouble. They just had another election today, fellows, where it’s a disaster. The votes come in, they have no idea, they can’t count them. And, I don’t mean they’re off by a little bit, they’re off by 20 percent, 25 percent. There’s fraud. There’s missing ballots. They have a woman in New York who is a terrible congresswoman, you know that. Carolyn Maloney. They gave her an election, they can’t even find the ballots. And, they gave her a victory, and they cant find that the guy that is against her, who did very well, even though he’s even more progressive, I don’t even know what she is. I’ve known her for 25 years. I don’t think she’s progressive. I think she’s whatever she has to be. But this guy, probably or possibly beat her. So, rightfully he’s not too happy. And, they called the election for her and they can’t find the ballots. Wants to force you to provide free healthcare to illegal aliens, you remember he raised his hand, that will totally drain your wonderful Medicare. Remember the question up there, he’s standing up, ” Who is willing to give free healthcare to illegal aliens.” And, everybody raises their hands like fast. Kamala was right up there. By the way, that will destroy your country, you do know that. Because you can’t afford it, and Biden’s looking around, “Oh, they all raise their hand.” He goes, remember. I remember. I said, “Well, there it goes, the election for him.” He’s end our travel bans on jihadist regions and increase refugee admissions by over 700 percent. And, that’s the deal he made with Bernie Sanders, opening the flood gates to terror, afflicted nations. But I predict the Sanders people are going to vote for us, like they did the last time. We had a tremendous…. Because they love my stance on trade, because I know trade, and I was telling him much more so, than even Bernie. But Bernie, is right on that subject, that other countries, including our so-called allies are ripping us off on trade. Biden opposes, school choice and vowed to ban charter schools. Did you know that? Does everybody like charter schools? Everybody likes choice. In the second term, I will provide school choice to every parent in America. We’re all set up to get it done. A vote for republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans. It’s really a vote for the American dream, instead of letting Washington change us. And, despite all that we’ve all gone through. We are changing Washington, that’s what’s been happening. And, just in conclusion, and I hate concluding with you because I like you. I like you. I don’t know why the hell I like Wisconsin, but for some reason. You know what helps so, as you know for weeks before the election, she was four up, crooked Hillary, four up, four up, four up, I kept saying, “Do you think we’re going to win?” And I will say, Sean Duffy said, “You’re going to win.” He actually said, “Don’t worry about it.” Right, Sean. I said, “Sean do you think we’re going to win here?” I don’t like these polls, but four down. He said, “Sir, you’re going to win so easy.” And, early in the night, they said, “Donald Trump has won the state of Wisconsin.” And, so when I’m here, speaking in the freezing cold, I’m lucky they had… I said, “Do you think we have…?” It’s very warm in New York and very warm in Washington, it was hot actually. And I said, “Do you think we have a coat on the plane?” They said, “Yes.” I said, “What’s the temperature?” “Sir, it’s 49 degrees.” I said, “How about giving me a coat?” They have everything on Air Force One, that’s the great thing. Got more televisions in any plane in history. They’ve got televisions in closets, on floors, on ceiling. But, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And, we will end our reliance on China once and for all. We’ll make our medical supplies right here in the United States, and right here in the great state of Wisconsin. We will rapidly return to full employment, that’s happening very fast, soaring economies; and the record prosperity will be even greater than it was, last year. We will hire more police, increase penalties on assaults of law enforcement, surge federal prosecutors into high crime communities. And, we will ban sanctuary cities, which are deadly. We will appoint prosecutors, judges, and justices who believe in enforcing the law, not their own political agenda. We will ensure equal justice for citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed. We will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We will uphold religious Liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear Arms. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens, and we will keep America out of endless Foreign Wars. And, you remember with me, they thought because of my personality, they said, “He’ll be in war the first week.” What happened to the war? Remember, we were going to be in war with North Korea. Hillary would have been in war with North Korea. It would have been a nasty one too. But remember, everybody said, I was going to be in war. Everybody said, “Oh, maybe I’ll do something with social security.” And, I did. I saved it and made it stronger. And now, I’m going to make it even stronger. And, they’re going to get rid of your social security because everything’s going to come collapsing down. You will have a depression. If he gets in, they’re going to raise interest rates. They’re going to raise your taxes, you will have a depression. The likes of which this country has never seen before. And, your 401k’s and your stocks and jobs will go down in flames. I just say it here, hopefully we’re never going to experience it, but that’s what’s going to happen. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency, which I’ve already signed. Further reduced health insurance premiums, or the costs of prescription drugs, which are coming down now. You know, I signed favored nations clauses, their drug companies are not happy with me, I will tell you. They never thought it was possible and rebate clauses. They never thought anybody would do that to them. They made enough money for a long time. It’s time, you got a big break. We will strongly protect Medicare and social security. And, we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions, always, you have a pledge. We will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. And, NASA is now the hottest space center anywhere in the world. And, when I took over three and a half years ago, there was grass growing in the runways, you know that it was closed down, it was a mess. We are now the hottest in the world. You see what’s going up. And, we’ve got a lot of rich guys sending them up too. I liked that better. I said, “Let them do it.” Rich guys like rockets, I don’t know, they like rocket, boom. I see dollars going right up, but they need a good place to launch. We have the best places. We have the best places, so it’s been incredible what we’ve done with NASA. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We’re already there again. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. And, we will live by the timeless works of our national motto, In God We Trust. For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now, you have a president who is standing up for America, and standing up for the State of Wisconsin. So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, get everybody and get out and vote, November 3rd. From Milwaukee to Madison, from Oshkosh to La Crosse. From Green Bay, how the Packers doing so far? Good team, good people, to right here in… Give me the proper pronunciation. That’s right, thank you, that’s what I said. We inherit the legacy of generations of Wisconsin Patriots, who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for this beloved nation. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blazed the trails, settled the continent, tamed a wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, revolutionized industry, won two World Wars, defeated fascism and communism; and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And, you haven’t seen anything yet. Proud citizens like you, helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together, with the incredible people of Wisconsin, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Wisconsin. Thank you. Thank you. 
















"
"63","09-18-20","There’s a lot of people. That’s great. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. That’s a big group of people. This is on fast notice, too. Thank you. Well, I just want to say hello, Minnesota. We love you, Minnesota. You’re great. [crosstalk 00:12:53]. We’ve got to win Minnesota, because they did nothing for Minnesota except close up that beautiful [inaudible 00:13:03] territory. They closed it up with a pen. Do you remember that one day? You didn’t have your jobs. Then I came along, and I opened it up. So that’s But I’m thrilled to be here with the beautiful, great, hardworking people of this incredible state. You’re really hardworking American patriots. That’s what you are, and a lot of people haven’t been treated right until I came along. We’ve done a lot of work and a lot of good work, and you had your best year ever last year. The state had the best year you’ve ever had. 46 days from now, we’re going to win Minnesota, and we’re going to win four more years in the White House. One of the most vital issues in this election is the subject of refugees. You know it. You know it perhaps better than almost anybody. Lots of luck. You’re having a good time with the refugees. That’s good. We want to have Omar. He said Omar. That’s a beauty. How the hell did she win the election? How did she win? It’s unbelievable. Every family in Minnesota needs to know about sleepy Joe Biden’s extreme plan to flood your state with an influx of refugees from Somalia, from other places all over the planet. Well, that’s what’s happened, and you like Omar a lot, don’t you? Biden has promised a 700% increase in the manifesto with Bernie, right? A 700% increase in the importation of refugees from the most dangerous places in the world, including Yemen, Syria, and Somalia. Congratulations, Minnesota. A 700% increase. Good luck, Minnesota. Enjoy yourselves, because if I’m not here, if I don’t win, I don’t know where I’m going to be. But maybe I’ll come over to see Mike. I’ll come and see Mike. Your state will be overrun and destroyed, and Biden and the radical Left win. That’s what’s going to happen. I’ve been watching it for years. They haven’t treated you right. They have not treated Minnesota right. Thank you. I’ll tell you, these hangers are great. Remember this. It’s a friendly protest. Please remember this is not a rally. You’re not allowed to have political rallies of any kind. You’re not allowed to go to church. You’re not allowed to do anything. The only thing you’re allowed to do is run wild through the streets, burn down storefronts, blow up stores, and kill people, because that’s considered a protest, and that, they allow you to have. You don’t have to wear masks at protests. So I said, “We can’t have a rally. The most we can have is ten people. But why don’t we just call it a protest?”, because this is a protest. It’s a protest against stupidity. Speaking about stupidity, sleepy Joe will turn Minnesota into a refugee camp. Think of it. 700% increase. So you’re not happy now? Look at that guy over there. He’s not too thrilled when he hears this. 700% increase is what they have in the manifesto. Now, maybe they don’t honor it, but I would say they’ll go substantially higher than that number. Biden will overwhelm your children’s schools, overcrowd their classrooms, and inundate your hospitals. That’s what’ll happen. Biden has even pledged to terminate our travel ban to jihadist regions, jihadist regions. They’ve already been doing that to you, haven’t they? Opening the flood gates to radical Islamic terrorists. My administration’s keeping terrorists, extremists, and criminals the hell out of our country. We don’t want them. We don’t want them. We’ve got enough of them. We’ve got enough of them. Just today, we deported, as you know very well, dozens of Somali nationals charged or convicted with very grave crimes, including rape, assault, robbery, terrorism, and murder, of course. These hardened criminals are back in their country, where they do all the complaining they want, and your children are much safer as a result. Thank you, President Trump. Thank you. If it were up to Biden, and it’s not. It’s the people that’s around him. They are seriously radical Left Democrats, and they’re very dangerous. The offenders are very dangerous, and they’d be running all over your state. Only by voting for me are you going to say … But I hate to say this, and get it with your iron ore. I did it with some other things, and I’ll do it for you again. I’ll do it for you again. But if you vote for me, I’m the difference, and I’m the wall. You know the wall that we’re building on the southern border? I’m your wall between the American Dream and chaos. Joe Biden is wholly owned and controlled by the left wing mob. He has no clue where he is. This is not a sharp guy. Years ago, I said to a certain senator who I was very friendly with, a Democrat, “Who’s the dumbest senator? Who’s the smartest senator?” He gave me a name for the smartest. I said, “Who’s the dumbest?” “Oh, Joe Biden. You didn’t know that?” That was 25 years ago. That was in prime time. This is no longer prime time for sleepy Joe. They do disinformation. They make things up, and they make commercials. They make things up. I’ve never seen anything like it. Everything, they make up. First of all, I’m the one protecting your Social Security. They say, “Trump” … Remember four years ago, they used to say, “Oh, Trump will get rid of Social” … I have protected your Social Security. They’re going to destroy your Social Security. Another thing, Big 10 football. Did I do a good job? Your team better do well. They’re on the spot. They better do well. Are they going to do well this year? I think so, right? When I brought it back. But I saw an ad. Do you know why I did it, actually? It sort of energized me. Sleepy Joe did an ad that I was against football, that I was against Big 10 football. Give me a break. When I saw the ad, I said, “What’s the problem with Big 10 football?” They said, “They’re not going to open.” “Why?” They say some stupid reason. I said, “These are strong young people. They’re going to do great. Let’s get going.” I called the commissioner, Kevin. Good guy, and we sort of started something. We got it rolling. We had big opposition from a few of the Democrat states and governors, but we rolled over the opposition, and you have Big 10 football. Congratulations. Congratulations. When the far Left riders rampage across Minneapolis and they rampage across your state, how about your police department? Let’s just run for your lives, and it’s not their fault. They were told to do that. You have a good police department. You have good police, but they’re not allowed to do their job. They’re not allowed to do their job. Remember that? They were told to leave the precinct. Leave it, and then they knocked the hell out of that precinct, didn’t they? Had a great mayor. Great mayor. Really, he’s a real [inaudible 00:21:10]. Remember? Did you ever hear of a man, Fiorello La Guardia? Did you ever? I don’t think that happened with him. New York, I don’t think it happened with Rudy Giuliani, did it? What a great job Rudy did. You realize Rudy’s just now really being appreciated. People forgot how good he was as a man. He was a great mayor. Joe Biden called the peaceful protestors. He said these are peaceful protestors, as opposed to sending in the National Guard. They didn’t want the National Guard. Joe Biden said you shouldn’t send the National Guard, and this went on day after day after day. I pushed, and I got it approved. The National Guard went in. It ended within what would you say, half hour? It was about a half an hour. You wouldn’t have Minneapolis. You better remember this when you go and vote and your voting [crosstalk 00:21:59]. You’d be saying, “Do you remember when we had a city called Minneapolis? If you remember, it used to be over there. It’s all ashes now. That place was coming down. You didn’t have anything, but wasn’t that a beautiful sight?” Look. All of a sudden, you saw one guy in a black uniform, then another, then another on the street. Remember that street loaded up with CNN reporters? Remember Ali Velshi, shaved head, nice hair, shaved head? Some people say I should do that. Shave the head. Just give it up. [crosstalk 00:22:41]. We polled it. I’d go down about 22 points. They want to poll everything nowadays. I don’t believe in polls. They poll everything. But Ali Velshi, I don’t know anything about the guy, but I know he was standing there. This is really quite a good scene. It’s a friendly protest. Everyone’s acting … and behind him, the entire city was burning. It’s one of the great pictures of all time. The entire city was burning down. That was your city, and it’s a shame it took so long, but the governor finally did it at least. If you take a look at Portland, the governor can’t quite do it. She can’t get there. I speak to her all the time. “Come on, Governor. I can straighten out Portland. Give me less than an hour. Just let us have it for” … because the state has to ask for it. They have to request. It’s a shame. It’s such a shame. But in your case, we went, and all of a sudden, it was really … That was going to be a bad night, too, right? Remember that, about seven o’clock? Then you see this guy walked out with about a $250,000 outfit on. That’s because it had more computers and this and that. Got the tear gas deal. He’s got the whole deal, pepper spray, got everything, the finest outfit you can buy. Believe me. We just paid for them, and they were very expensive. So we see one, the helmet. How about the helmet with the goggles? You can see at night. You can see at day. You can see whenever the hell you want. So there’s one. I said, “Oh, that’s only one guy.” Then you see another three, then four. Then you see another ten. They were just getting out of the buses, coming from very friendly territory. Then you have a line, and they were very tight together. There was no social distancing at all, which we’re going to have to speak to them about that. No, they were touching. They were touching, right? So you had the first one. Then you had a second one. Then you had a third one. Then you had another one. Then they said, “March.” I remember this guy, [inaudible 00:24:42]. He got hit on the knee with a canister of tear gas, and he went down. He was down. “My knee, my knee.” Nobody cared. These guys didn’t care. They moved them aside, and they just walked right to … It was the most beautiful thing. No, because after we take all that crap for weeks and weeks, they would take this crap, and then you finally see men get up there and go right to … Wasn’t it really a beautiful sight? For law and order, law and order. Portland would be easier, because it’s more confined. We’d just [inaudible 00:25:19], and that would be it. But so they had four or five lines. Then they had lines of different … Everybody did the same thing. Did they ever even move one step back? I don’t think so, right? It was just a slow walk right forward. Then they just started walking faster, faster, faster, put a lot of guys in jail, Tom, right? Put a lot of guys … Great Congressman, by the way. Put a lot of guys in jail. Great. Not good. Great. They put a lot of guys in jail that night, Tom, and that was the end of it. I don’t think he had any problem after that. If you had any flare-ups, we’ll send them in again. But that’s all you do. These are Democrat-run disasters. Look at Chicago. Look at Portland. Look at you with Minneapolis. These are disasters. By the way, are they still trying to get rid of your police force in Minneapolis? That’s what I heard. See, they never learn. They never learn. They don’t … You’ve got a lot of people here. That’s a lot of people. I actually like these. We have the arenas. We’ve always filled them up. It’s been great, and the arenas are good, but usually you have to travel 45 minutes. This thing, you have a hangar. The plane becomes your backstop, right? It’s like your curtain. It’s a curtain. You get a free curtain. We’re outside, which actually makes people happy. It even makes the people that sometimes not everybody here likes happy, because outside is better. It’s better, and we’re rounding the turn on COVID, by the way. Our vaccines are coming. A lot of things are happening. We’re rounding the turn. We’ve done a great job. We’ve done a phenomenal job. We don’t get credit for that, but we’ll discuss that in a minute. But when you look at it, when you look at it, our country is amazing. It’s an amazing country. We love this country, and we’re not going to let radical Left socialist/communists take over our country. Okay? They use the word socialist, and socialists aren’t great. But communists are a hell of a lot worse, and that’s where we’d be headed. We’re standing in the way of them, this group of people. But you have a lot of groups of people just like this, every place we go. Last night, you know where we were. You saw that it was all over the place, right? That’s a big state. That’s a great state. Then I see the fake polls. I just saw a poll here, Minnesota. I’m down nine. I don’t think so. I mean, I just don’t think so. I don’t think so, right? I don’t think so. It’s the craziest thing I’ve ever seen. This is the craziest thing I’ve seen. President Trump is down nine in Minnesota. Now I just saw another plane. See the plane? The good thing about these beautiful Air Force Ones, right? That’s the smaller version of Air Force One. I think you had a little bit short runway. So they take the smaller to save about $12. No, they took the smaller one. But the great thing about those beautiful planes, they have more televisions than any plane in history. We have televisions in the closet, on the ceilings, on the floors. I’ve never seen them on the … We have them all over the place, and I’m just coming out. They said, “There he is.” They said, “It’s a smattering of people.” They called it a smattering. They always do that. Yet Biden with the circles, right? The little circles. He’s got like four people in a circle. You know why he does the circles? Because he can’t draw a crowd. So they put a circle, like he’s supposed to … He’s trying to be legitimate. He’s going to go by the science. He always says science. He doesn’t know what the word science is. So to have these four or five circles, they put people, that way he doesn’t have to be embarrassed when he goes to a high school gymnasium and he has 40, 50 people. They had one not so long ago, and you saw this. He couldn’t draw a crowd. It was a big thing. It was his opening or something. Couldn’t draw a crowd. So they made it a round table. So he went in. They only had like 32 people. They said, “This is very embarrassing,” one of his people, and that’s what they do. They’re good. Some of the people surrounding him, they’ll say anything and do anything. They said, “Let’s not make it a speech. There’s nobody here. Let’s make it a round table.” So these people are sitting at a table. They had no idea, and most of them didn’t know anything about politics. They didn’t even know why they were there. Now they’re sitting on a round table, and they’re on television. But that’s what it is. But they say we had a smattering of people. Yes, smattering of about what? 15,000 people in about two days’ notice. This doesn’t include the 10,000 people, Mike, that they turned away. I hate that they turned them away. You’d think with an airport, you wouldn’t have to turn anybody away, but they have a certain amount. Then sometimes you have Democrats running an airport, and they don’t like all these people here. That’s true. They don’t like it. But if we’re up to Biden, your state would be in ruins. Just take a look at what they’ve done, and I’m going to hit it hard. They make phony commercials about me, and it gives me the right. How about the worst one of all, the worst I’ve ever seen? Standing on a grave of a fallen soldier, and then they had some guy, a source said … There’s no source. The source doesn’t exist. They make it up, and then they take it. It’s called disinformation. You’re not supposed to do that. I’m not even sure if he knows. He’s too weak to understand, and he’s still weak to control his people. But it allows me to say whatever I want about this guy. The truth is, he’s not fit to be your President. He’s not mentally fit. If Biden’s elected, extremists, like representative Ilhan Omar … Whatever happened to her? You had a great writer who has just made a living off writing about her. She’s done so many criminal acts. Isn’t it damn disgraceful that she gets away with it? I have to say to myself, I say, “How the hell did she get away with that? If we do one” … Look at General Flynn. He didn’t even lie. They said he didn’t lie, right? He’s gone through hell. He’s gone through hell. This guy wrote page after page of criminal acts. Well, let’s see what happens. Who the hell knows? But between her and how about AOC? AOC is running a campaign against the guy that was supposed to be speaker of the house. Right? Joe Crowley. I knew him a little bit. I asked him once I said, “Are you campaigning against this maniac?” He said, “No, she’s just a young girl. No problem.” I called him on election night. Nah, I was going to, I was going to say, “How did that work out, Joe? That didn’t work.” He was going to be Speaker Of The House. He’s got a certain talent. But you know she had no money, nothing. And all of a sudden she had $2,000,000 and she spent the $2,000,000 all over the place. Her and her boyfriend. Whatever happened to her? Can you imagine if I’d do that? You have to look at that. She spent the $2,000,000 and big story. But that was it. That’s one quick story. Oh man. Probably the guy who wrote the story, lost his job at the New York Times. Right? He’s now unemployed, but there’s a big story. She spent $2,000,000 on bullshit. If a Republican did that they’d be in jail. You know that. It’s a different standard and it’s a disgrace. And our guys better get on the ball. Look, let me tell you how about yesterday. They were talking about Russia, Russia, Russia. Again, here we go with the Russia. There’s never been anybody so tough on Russia with the sanctions. Remember Obama would send pillows. I sent tank busters right to Ukraine. I’m the one that exposed the pipeline with Germany. Germany pays them billions and billions of dollars. And then we’re supposed to protect Germany from Russia. I said, “How does that work? How does that work? You’re spending billions of dollars for energy to Russia.” It’s all okay. I’m the one that exposed it. What I’ve done … Hey, they don’t want me to go. But if you look, they don’t want me to win. Russia doesn’t want … Maybe North Korea does because I actually have a very good relationship with him. And speaking of North Korea and you know, it’s okay to have really. You don’t have to go to wars. We don’t have to lose our great soldiers. It’s good. If I got along with Putin. Somebody said “He gets along well with Putin.” I’m saying to myself, “But isn’t that sort of a good thing? Is that bad.” “He gets along with Putin. That’s a bad thing.” But you saw the head of the FBI yesterday started going Russia. Russia is looking at our election. Russia. Here we go again. Russia, Russia, Russia. I said, “What about China? What about North Korea? What about Iran? What about … ” They don’t mention anybody else. The narrative seems to be Russia. Millions of phone calls made not one to Russia. Millions of phone calls received not one to Russia. Then he goes, “Russia, Russia.” Then they asked him about Antifa. What do you think about Antifa? “Well, it’s an ideology.” I said, “No, it’s not. It’s a bunch of thugs and anarchists that are being funded by somebody and find out who the somebody is.” It’s unbelievable. Unbelievable when you look at this stuff. But seriously, take a look at the AOC. I call it AOC plus three. Her three people that she tells what to do. And $2,000,000. Dresses, rent, other things. You’re not supposed to do that. Mr. Congressman, are you allowed to do that Sir? You don’t do that. You don’t buy dresses do you? If he does that’s the end of his career right? No. But it’s terrible. Right John? It’s terrible. Will prosecute him. I mean, why not? I don’t understand it. I’ll tell you what. One friend of mine, very sophisticated guy, very successful guy called me up. He says, “You know. From the day you came down the escalator with our great First Lady, our future First Lady.” He said “From that day the people love her. She gave a great speech at the Republican National Convention at The White House. She gave a great speech.” But said “From the day you came down the escalator with our First Lady. From the single day you’ve been under investigation. You’ve been under investigation by sleazebags. People that now we caught, cleaned up their phones.” You’re not allowed to do that. Right Mr.. Congressman? My great hockey player. You’re the greatest. Right? But you’re not allowed to do that. You know? We want their phones. “Oh, here they are. Oh, by the way, they happen to be totally deleted.” Like Hillary with the 33,000 emails she deleted. I think they should look at that. Now even if they don’t find them. And I do believe they’re in the state department. I do believe they’re in the FBI. I do believe they’re in the FBI. But even if you forget about it, she said she had 33,000 emails. And the emails were for her yoga lessons. She’s not big into yoga [inaudible 00:05:09]. If she is, she’s not getting her money worth. Her yoga lessons and her daughter’s wedding. Right? So it was about the wedding and the yoga lessons. So I said, “Okay, let’s give her five or six each.” What do you think, Mike? Five or six each. Five for the wedding. Make it 30. Make it a hundred. Make it a thousand. A thousand for the wedding. And for the yoga, let’s give her 200. Okay. What about all those thousands and thousands of emails. Probably classified. So Congress … So forget about it. Let’s assume they’re gone because she deleted them and then she acid washed them. And then she hit her phones with a hammer. I get rid of phones. I’ve never hit him with a hammer. Not even as President. I say, “Yeah. Throw the phone away.” No, no. I’ve never hit a phone. Has anybody ever gotten rid of your phone and taken a hammer and wiped the hell out of it? I don’t think so. So she gets a subpoena from the U S Congress. Not in a lawsuit against some guy that hates you and you’re fighting and you’re fighting or something. By the way you do that, you’ve got problems in court, big problems. But she gets a subpoena from Congress. U.S. subpoena, the most important subpoena you can get. They get the subpoena. And after she gets the subpoena, by a few days everything is deleted. Her phones are busted up and cleaned and wiped. And everything’s gone. And nothing happens to her. Forget about what was on. Now think of how angry it makes me when I see it. Now how angry? Could you imagine if I’d do that it’s a whole different ball game. Know how angry it makes me when I see it. And we had an attorney general that didn’t have a clue. That was my fault. I was loyal to somebody. Endorsed me early. You know whey he endorsed me? Because I went to Mobile, Alabama. We had 55,000 people show up at a stadium. He said, “I’d like to endorse you.” Then after we won, he said, “I’d love to be attorney general.” And I said, “No, I don’t think so.” But after four or five times asking, I’m a loyal person and I did it. The mistakes sometimes you make is because of loyalty, but that’s okay. But allowed her to get away with that is a disgrace. Maybe there’s something they can do. So forget about looking for the emails. And they are available. And I guarantee they’re in the State Department. I guarantee you they’re in the state department that ought to damn well find them. They’re being protected in the State Department. But forget about that. Almost as good is the fact that you’re not allowed to do what she did and her lawyers should pay, Kendall should pay, equal consequence. Equal consequence. Equal. But that’s the way it is. But we are making a lot of progress if you see what’s going on. I said to myself, “I’m going to stay uninvolved. I don’t have to. Chief Law Enforcement Officer, can you believe it? But I think it’s better if I stay uninvolved.” And I have stayed uninvolved and we do have an excellent Attorney General. Bill Barr. And I’ll be honest, he’s a smart guy. I think he’s getting tougher and tougher and tougher every day. I think he’s not going to put up with this stuff. I don’t think. And you know he’s got a lot of people that are deep staters, whatever you want to call them. They fight him at every turn. They fight him, fight him, fight him. But he’s getting tougher and tougher. I watched over the last three days, I’m saying, “Wow, that’s sort of what we’re all waiting for. Right?” But she deletes her emails. AOC gets rid of $2,000, 000. Gets rid of it. Nothing happens. Nothing happens. And then she goes around and calls us all like what the hell are we? And she controls Nancy Pelosi. Actually Nancy Pelosi would love to get rid of her I think. How about Pelosi? Pelosi goes out and says, “You know. I think I have my hair done.” So she goes out and she goes into this beauty parlor. I told the story in Wisconsin last night. By the way, we had that great crowd in Wisconsin. You have a feeling about places. You know the problem with Minnesota is that I think since 1972, this hasn’t been won by a Republican. So, you’re a little behind the eight ball when you hear that. Right? I mean, I can understand. And Wisconsin rarely. But I won Wisconsin. Unlike Minnesota thank you very much. Thank you very much, Tom. Thank you. Unlike Minnesota. But it’s my fault. So I had one speech left. It started at one in the morning. I went to Michigan, we won Michigan. That was another one. Great state. We brought back so many auto companies into Michigan. We brought them back. But I had one. It was already voting day. It was election day. Because by the time I got there it was just scheduled. Had I made that one damn stop to your state we would have won Minnesota. I lost by what? A half a point. Half a point. But I get off the plane and they said, “He’s in Minnesota. He’s down nine.” The recent poll. Down nine. I believe it’s a suppression poll. And you know, I have an instinct about things pretty much. Somebody said “Trump has the greatest political instincts of the last 100 years.” One of my enemies said that. And I said, “No, I don’t.” I don’t believe I do. I think I have lousy political instincts.” But what am I going to tell you? Let me just say they said that. And I was very impressed by the statement. In fact, I went to my wife I said, “You know, they say I have the greatest political instincts in over a hundred years.” And I said, “But I don’t believe it. I don’t.” I don’t want to be Beto. Remember Beto? “I was born to run for president.” That was the end of his career. Beto O’Rourke who’s in charge of guns. By the way, he’s going to take your guns away. You know that, right? Biden. Sleepy Joe. Sleepy Joe is going to take your guns away. Remember Beto on the cover of a really crummy magazine. I won’t mention the name. They’ve got a lot of bad magazines out there. The good news is most of them are dying. If not all of them. But Beto O’Rourke, he did the story and he was going to defeat Ted Cruz. He was going to do all these things. Ted beat him. And I helped a lot too. I was with Ted all the way. And I think Ted’s appreciated it. But I even said, “I’m putting Ted Cruz as one of the people for the Supreme Court.” Right? And you know why I did it? You know why I did it? Because I wanted to make sure that I had somebody on a list we had about 45 unbelievable people, unbelievable. The smartest, the best. The absolute creme de la creme, right? The best minds in the country. Conservative. They believe in the constitution. Little things like that. But I said, “You know. I have to have somebody that we’re going to make sure we get approved.” And the only one I could think of is Ted, because he’s going to get 50 Republican votes and he’s going to get 50 Democrat votes. They’ll do anything to get them out of the Senate. But I joke when I say that to Ted. But I say it all the time. Ted is the only man I know could get a hundred votes from the Senate. Every single Senator is going to vote for him. But he’s a great guy. And he’s a brilliant guy. And he’s been great. He’s been really great. I kid, when I say that. But one of the things we’ve done that’s so good is the Supreme court. We have two Supreme court justices. We will have at the end of my term, approximately 300 federal judges and [inaudible 00:45:09]. Right? So anyway, but just to finish, there’s no way that I’m nine points down. I look at a crowd. So they say instinct, right? So I look at a crowd and whether I have good instinct or not, this is not the crowd of somebody that’s going to finish second in the state to a Sleepy Joe. Finish second to a guy that cannot put two sentences together. Now it is an ideology. It doesn’t matter. I could put that broken piece of wood right there. I could put that out. And it’s the same thing as Joe. It’s just an ideology. It’s just an idea. Now, historically, we have the biggest gap in enthusiasm of any campaign that they’ve ever opposed. You heard that. Like 36 points. In other words, they’ve got no enthusiasm for him. I have tremendous enthusiasm as we can tell. But he does have enthusiasm to beat Trump. His only enthusiasm is put anybody in there. Right? Put anybody in there. He does have enthusiasm to beat Trump. Nothing for him, but to beat Trump. Okay. But historically that never wins. When somebody has to rely on winning because of somebody as opposed to winning because people love you, people respect you … And Sean Hannity did something the other night. He said to this man, “If you owned a McDonald’s hamburger stand in a reasonably busy area, would you have Joe Biden running that stand?” The answer is no. He doesn’t have the energy. He doesn’t. So he can’t run the country. No, seriously. I thought it was good. I never thought of it. You wouldn’t have him running your business. You wouldn’t have him running a McDonald’s. I have to say or a Wendy’s. I have a friend he owns Wendy’s. He always gets up. Ken, you haven’t mentioned Wendy’s? Okay. But you know you wouldn’t do it because he couldn’t do it. And yet he’s running for the presidency. He’s got no energy. I made a comment that somebody had low energy. That was the end of his political career. But Joe’s energy is far lower. It’s far lower. No, it’s far lower than Jeb. Jeb was on the low side. But Joe, he’s off the scale. Right? Joe’s got nothing going. Today Biden delivered remarks, barely, to a union after spending 47 years giving their jobs to China and foreign countries in exchange for campaign cash. How about his statement? Hey, we talk about AOC being crooked. She’s a hundred percent crooked. Okay. But were talking about that. Look at Omar. She came in here. Did she marry her brother? Where’s that writer? That writer should be given the Pulitzer prize. He never will be. He should be though. You know the amazing thing, all of these writers, New York Times, Washington Post, right? Russia, Russia, Russia. Trump. Russia, Russia, Russia. I had 19 people. All brilliant. All radical left. All Hillary people. Actually not even a never Trumper from Bush. Okay. All Hillary Clinton people mostly, almost everyone. They were all Democrats. How about this? You’re being investigated by 19 Democrats that are smart people. Okay? Smart people. So my friend says, “You know, you are the most honest person in the world. And you’ve taken three years of total investigation.” You don’t think they’ve gone over my taxes. They went over at the biggest tax firm in the country. The most prestigious. They went over everything. They spend 48 million as it comes out now. It’s about $48,000,000 investigating me before I won and after I won. And we caught them spying on my campaign. That’s what they were really doing. And now with the phones, I think there’s like 22 or 24 people. You heard this one? They said, “No, no, no. We made a mistake when we deleted our phone.” You know what they had to do to make that mistake? Like 19 different formulas. Right? I don’t even know how you delete a phone. I didn’t know you could do it. But they all made the exact same mistake. That’s not good. That’s not good. So let’s see what happens to them. It’s a criminal act you know that, right? It’s a criminal act. It’s criminal. Weissman’s a bad guy. Put a lot of people in jail that shouldn’t be in jail, Weissman. He’s a bad guy. He’s on CNN all the time or MSNBC which I call it MSDNC. Because it’s the same thing. Owned by a company called Concast. Did anyone ever hear … With an N, not an M. Con like a con job. Concast. They a fortune on public relations. Comcast has delivered you the news, all the news. And they spend a fortune. And then I go up and make one speech and I call them Concast And that’s the end of the PR for the year. They are a bad group of people. They’re sick. I mean, they’re sick people. They’re sick and evil people and they want bad things for our country and they don’t report the news. You know, in the old days, when you used public airways free, you had to get a license. I keep saying, “If they’re reporting fake news, how come they can keep getting a license?” Whether it’s ABC, whether it’s NBC, CBS, or of course, CNN. Which is I mean one of the great jokes of all time, CNN. Or MSDNC. But they’re cable so I guess there’s a different standard. But when you’re using the public airwaves free. Okay? Free. Aren’t you supposed to get licensed? So I asked my people that. I ask a couple of guys and I never really get an answer. I just want to know a simple question. Do you have to report the truth when you using free airwaves and making a fortune with commercials and everything else. And I never get the right answer because there are people down deep. It’s crazy. But we’re getting down to all of it. A lot of progress has been made. I think you’re starting to see it. We’re trying to beat a terrible group of deep state people. You know I came to Washington … Think of it, think of it. I came to Washington and I had 24 years of putting people in office. And then you can probably add another four to that. And another four to that. I had many, many years, decades of people putting … So I came. Been to Washington I guess 17 times I never stayed over. Right? Never slept over. I was there 17 times. I tell the story. I was in Washington and my entire life, DC, 17 times. Never slept over ever not once. And all of a sudden I’m riding down Pennsylvania Avenue and I’m with a beautiful woman on my right named Melania. Think of this. And I had about 400 motorcycles in front of me. And we’re in a cavalcade of about 128 cars. Most of them having about 15 sub machine guns inside. There’s more firepower But we’re riding down the beautiful Pennsylvania Avenue. And I look outside at those police. I love our police. We’ve got to treat our police better. I had everything. I had police. I had military. I had soldiers. I had everything you could possibly have. You never saw so much how power and strength and beauty. The beauty. And they were so proud. They’re all saluting, they’re so proud. They’re happy to have gotten rid of that crowd that was there before us. They’re proud. They’re great. The police. You know, every single police force I think endorsed me. I got the one yesterday from Chicago. That’s not easy. Chicago endorsed me. New York’s finest endorsed me. Florida. Ohio. I mean, everybody. I don’t know that he’s gotten one vote. Then he says he can’t mention the words law and order. But I’m driving down the street. And I look at my wife, I say, “Do you believe it? I’m the president of the United States? [inaudible 00:53:18] Can you believe it? And then I get to the most beautiful house in the world. I can have Mar-a-Largo and all of them. But I’ll tell you The White House is still The White House, no matter how you do it. And I get to this gorgeous, beautiful place. And I’m up at the incredible suite level and there’s Abraham Lincoln’s suite. It’s called the Lincoln bedroom. Remember Clinton used to lease it out to people for money. They never change do they. Remember when Barbara Streisand, she’s another beauty, by the way. But remember Barbara Streisand used to stay in that suite? Which was the only problem I had with it. But tell me … No, but I do like her voice. I do. I really do. Some of them I don’t like even their voices. But she used to stay there. And I’m standing in the Lincoln bedroom. The history of the whole thing. The bed, the desk, the Gettysburg address, the beautiful four score and seven years ago. This beautiful Gettysburg address. He wrote it there. And also on his carriage ride up to Gettysburg. He delivered the Gettysburg address and they say the only one that got worse press than I did was Abraham Lincoln. Did anyone ever hear that? And I said, “No way they got worse. Maybe he got bad. But no way he gets worse.” Now people are starting to say, “It’s probably true. I think you’ve got the worst.” Now they used to say, “No, no.” Newt Gingrich, great guy. He said, “Nope, Abraham Lincoln got the worst press. They were worse to him than anybody. He was a very depressed person. His wife was very depressed.” It was a depressed kind of a thing. He’s in a war, he’s in a revolution. And he was getting beaten a lot by Robert E. Lee. They want to rip his statue down all over the place. But Robert E. Lee whether you like statues or not, they don’t rip statues down anymore. I signed a law. 10 years in jail if they rip them down. But Robert E. Lee won many, many battles in a row and it was supposed to be over in one day. It was supposed to end immediately because the North was too powerful for the South. But it just shows when you have leaders, when you have a great general. And Robert E. Lee, he would have won except for Gettysburg. And that was because his general was killed who’s going to lead Gettysburg. Never fight uphill, me boys. Never fight uphill. He heard they were going up hill. Stop them, stop them. But we had no cell phones in that day, right? Congressmen? No cell phones. So they sent the horses to stop him. Stop him. But it was too late. They fought uphill and they got slaughtered. That’s what happened. But Robert E. Lee these were incredible things. But I hope you appreciate that we had a period of time when they were ripping down all of the statues and monuments. And I said to my people four months ago, I said, “This is crazy. These people.” And they don’t even know. They started ripping down Abraham Lincoln. When they hit Lincoln I said, “Wait a minute. This is the man. And you can’t do …” Then they hit George Washington, Thomas Jefferson. They hit everybody. They even had Gandhi. All Gandhi wanted was one thing. Peace. May we have peace. Rip down the statue we don’t like it. I don’t think they have any idea what they’re doing. I think they’re just a bunch of thugs. Okay? You want to know that? I think they are a bunch of thugs. They were going to March on Washington and they were going to rip down a statue of Abraham Lincoln. You know the exact statute. Its up very nicely. Up now. And by the way, they can take them down legally. They go through Congress as a way of doing it. But they didn’t want to do it that way. And they were marching on Washington. And I said, “Do we have any laws about this?” They said, “No, sir.” Now in Congress, the way it is now, the most you get is about a $10 fine. You rip down a $5 million statue and you got a $10 fine. Right? It’s different world. That’s when it was strong and they had laws. But we told and found this old act. And the old act said, if you rip down a monument or a statue, you get 10 years in prison. They call it prison, not jail, which sounds even worse. I said, “Bring that sucker up immediately to the Oval Office because there are a lot of people coming to Washington.” They were going to March on the Jefferson Memorial. Do you believe that? The Jefferson Memorial. We grow up … The Jefferson Memorial. They were going to March on the Jefferson Memorial. They were going to do damage to our beautiful Jefferson Memorial after Thomas Jefferson. And I did predict that. A friend of mine said, “You know, two years ago you said, next will be Robert E. Lee and then comes Washington. And Jefferson and Lincoln. They’d never stop. The only thing they understand is strength. Remember that.” They don’t understand weakness. There’s nothing you can do. These really stupid heads of these corporations that give hundreds of millions of dollars. It’s like blackmail money, right? But these stupid people that run, they get $40,000,000 a year and they’re weak. Okay, they’re weak. But these people, they’re anarchists and the only thing they understand is strength. So I said, “Let me see this document.” I said, “Wow, this is a very strong document.” And Derek is here. One of my attorneys, he did a great job. I don’t know where the hell Derek is. He’s around here. Actually he’s heard this before though. Not quite. You’re getting a very unique speech tonight. You know? I mean unlike Joe, I haven’t even looked at the teleprompter. This guy will “Move it up. Move it up. I can’t see. Move it up.” I haven’t looked at it. The poor teleprompter guy he’s sitting there “What do we do? We’re on line two of the teleprompter.” He said, “What do we do?” No, unlike Joe, I have not looked at the teleprompter. Oh, that poor Joe. You know what’s the worst part about him looking at the teleprompter? The worst part is that means that the fake news media is giving him the questions. Right? Like Donna Brazil, who was brilliantly hired by Fox. Fox has changed a little bit. Ladies and gentlemen, Donna Brazil, who was fired by CNN because she cheated and she gave crooked Hillary the questions to the debate. How would you like to be me? They give her questions to the debate. And I still won the debate and she had all the questions. Think of it. How do you do that? Donna Brazil is, ladies and gentlemen, she’s going to work for Fox. Oh, that’s great. That’s big difference. Big difference between four years ago and now. A lot of things have changed. But I’ll tell you what’s changed is the fact that we have more enthusiasm now than we did four years ago. It’s amazing right? But just to get back to the others. So I signed that wonderful executive order instituting this really tough law. And it says 10 years. It doesn’t say, you get 10 years, but you can take it down to three weeks. It says 10 years. So these guys had just gotten there. I had a news conference because I had to let them know about it. Right? We’ve got many people in jail right now from before nobody even talked about taking statues down. No, but I looked at the Andrew Jackson right? With the ropes. And I’ll tell you, the police did a great job. And Mark Meadows did a great job. He said, “Charge.” They charged. And they took these guys out and they were fairly tough. But the police were much tougher. DC police. They did a great job. They were watching and they weren’t able to do anything. Mark Meadows said “Charge.” It was like from 200 years ago it was crazy. They charged and they’d beat the hell out of these guys. Or you wouldn’t have that great statue on the horse of a great general. He was a great general. And he was a very good president. At least a good president. But he was a great general. The battle of New Orleans. Right? And they had this incredible picture of Andrew Jackson. And they were going to rip it down. And remember the ropes wrapped around the horse and the guy standing up there just [inaudible 01:01:55]. He went to jail too. We had all the evidence we needed. Thank you for that. I want to thank you fake news. We called the fake news. We said “Can we just have that please?” When they said, no, we just said, “We’ll take it off TiVo. That’s okay. Don’t worry about it.” One of the greatest inventions in history. Tivo better than television because television is useless without it. So, we signed it. And all of a sudden these same guys who were watching it, they left. Nobody showed up the next day. They’re going to have 25,000 people. They had 24 people, 5 of them were brought to prison. Okay. And the next day they said, “Well, we were going to save it for Saturday night.” And Saturday night nobody showed up. And nobody has showed up in four months to take down a statue. It’s true. Because you know why? They look and they say, “I want to take down that statue. I’m going to take down that statue. That statue’s coming down.” And then somebody says, “You know it’s 10 years in jail.” They go, “That’s too much. I’m getting out of here.” It’s true. Ten years is not acceptable, Mike. Right? Ten years is a lot to rip down a statue, have a little fun, especially when they have no idea what they’re ripping down. But we have an idea what they’re ripping down. They’re ripping down in many cases, greatness. They’re ripping down our past. They’re ripping down our history. And that’s where these guys begin. They take away your history. You look at the Middle East, you look all over. Look what ISIS did. Look what all of them do. They go down and they rip. They go into museums and they break everything and they rip everything. They want to take away your past. They’re not taking away the past of the United States of America. Not as long as I’m here. What do you want? Do you want me to go back on teleprompter anybody? Okay. Here’s the question. My poor guy must be having a fit. He’s over there. He’s so good at this stuff. He’s on line three. He said, “Sir, should I use turn the sucker off? Would you rather go teleprompter or freelance?” Isn’t it nice when you have the option because you have this and you have the option to go either? See, Joe doesn’t have the option. He doesn’t have the option. But if Biden wins, China wins, and it’s very simple. It’s very simple. By contrast, I rescued the Minnesota Iron Range, I did that. Just so you know, O-Biden. I call him O-Biden, it’s too long to say Obama and Biden, so I just go, O-Biden, because I don’t care about… Everyone said, “Oh no, he’s in trouble. Obama’s now campaigning.” Hey, he campaigned last time harder than Hillary. I said, “No, I want him to campaign because he brings out the base.” He brings out our base. And I’m only here because of him and Joe. If they were a good president and vice president, I wouldn’t be here. I had a very good life before. I’m doing this because they did such a [inaudible 01:05:14] job. I’m only here because of him. I could right now be having a very beautiful life of luxury, and here I am at the hangar in Minnesota with 15 or 20 or 25,000 people. And thousands of people that couldn’t get in, and I’m working my ass off. I could be at home having a good time, wonderful time. But the one thing I said is-But I say this. I say this look, I could be home. So home was New York. I had to bail out because it was too crazy, everything has fallen apart. But home, it’s so sad what the democrats have done to our great New York. Between a governor and a mayor, the crime is through the roof, the corruption is incredible, it’s a sad thing that’s happened to New York. Hopefully it’ll come back by somebody. Somebody will go in there and do like a Rudy. You know when Rudy took over, it was so bad and they were looking for somebody and they thought he was the guy because he was a tough guy. But somebody has to go in and clean it up. This mayor, he let go of a billion dollars worth of police. He actually believed the nonsense about defunding the police. And they’re all going to do it. They’re all going to do it. And New York people are going to do it. I’m being totally serious now. You’ve got to go out and you’ve got to vote for Trump. You got to break this spell from 1972. You saw Kenosha. What we did for other places, you saw the Kenosha, and that was gone. That was all gone. That place was gone. We sent in the troops, it was incredible what we did, and they did it on day three. Day three is better than two weeks later, like in Minneapolis. But they did it, and we’ve done a great job and the people of that great state, they understand it, and I just hope the people of your state of Minnesota understand it because we don’t have too many more chances with this stuff. We really don’t. We don’t have the luxury of sitting back and saying, “Let’s have four years of this maniac, vice president that he picked who treated him worse than any other person. That’s why I say the one person that he won’t pick… My great instincts, right? The one person he won’t pick is Kamala because she called him a racist, she tried to me-too him. He was me-too’d. “I’ve just been me-too’d Darling, what does that mean?” But they tried to me-too him. And she was the one that brought it up. Remember Tara? She was the one that brought it up, and then he goes, “Ladies and gentlemen, I’d like to pick… Wait a minute, let me get her name here. How do you pronounce it? It’s with a comma, like a comma, right? Like a comma.” Remember he couldn’t pronounce her name? He was saying her name wrong, and she had to interrupt him. No, my name is Kamala. Like comma. I remember that. Like a comma. H1N1, that’s right, Joe. Remember that Joe, H1N1. And how bad did he do in that though? How about that? How bad did he do? So come to think of it, he’s out there now today. It was pathetic. By the way, did you see the Anderson Cooper thing last night? You have to watch. I don’t want to watch, but I have an obligation. I’m competing against somebody. You don’t want to compete and say, “I’m not going to watch my competition, who wouldn’t?” It’s boring, but I got to watch. And he got through it. He met a couple of really… The chicken thing was bad. He said chicken many, many times, and it was a little strange that I thought it was over and he pulled it back. He was able to pull it back. But Anderson is a… And he interviewed me, he’s tough. You know, he can be tough, nothing against him. He could be very tough, but last night he was in rare form. He was, “Thank you very much for being here, Mr. Vice President, are you enjoying the run?” And compare that with my shot, where they asked me about doing ABC with George Stephanopoulos. I think it was great. I think it worked out great. You know what I call it? Debate prep. I call that free debate prep. But you know it’s nasty, it’s a little nasty that people… and I didn’t say, “No, you got to change the rules. No, give me the questions. I want to use a teleprompter to answer.” How about that though? Mr. Vice President, I’d like to know your feeling on nuclear warfare and how does that relate to China and Russia and where are they in the race? Well, you can’t have this as your president. I don’t care. Forget about me. You can’t do this. The importance and the power of this position are too great. You can’t do it. I’ve learned a lot as president. But one thing I learned is that President Xi of China is sharp. You ever see him standing with the two million men walking in front, everybody’s the same height, they’re wearing hats, everyone’s like a pool table, right? And he’s standing there by himself, and he’s looking like he’s not playing games. There’s no games, he’s sharp as you can be. And I had a great relationship, but now I feel differently. We made a great trade deal, and now I feel differently. But he’s a sharp as you can be. Putin as sharp as you can be. Kim Jong Un, we would have been in a war with North Korea 100%. I asked Obama, “Did you ever call him?” He said that was the toughest problem we had. And we get along. Remember about a month ago, two months ago, they broke into the demilitarized zone and they said, “Oh, he’s going to attack.” I said, “No, he’s not. Don’t worry about it.” I got to know him very well. We have a good relationship. People said, “He has a good relationship with Kim Jong Un, that’s terrible.” I said, “No, that’s good.” But you remember it was going to be a nuclear war, and I got along with him. Then they said, “Trump made a terrible deal. He’s given so much to North Korea.” What did I give? I was at like a semi debate with his idiot, a reporter. “He’s given a lot to North Korea.” “What did I give?” “I don’t know.” Sanctions, sanctions. You took away. No, I didn’t. Actually, I increased the sanctions very substantially. What did you give? What did I give? Tell me. So after about four days they couldn’t ask because I gave nothing except I gave heart because I don’t want to see people killed on their side either. I don’t want to see people killed. We’d win that. We’d win them all. We have the greatest weapons right now ever conceived by man. We’ve rebuilt our military to a level that nobody ever thought possible. And then the fake news. And I said that a couple of weeks ago, remember I said, “We have created the most powerful weapons known to man.” It’s true. We have weapons that are so advanced that President Xi, Putin, everybody, we’re the envy of the world. But they don’t know quite what we have, but they know we have stuff that they never even heard of before. And some schmuck back there said, “I think he’s given away classified information.” Now, all I’m doing is telling the world, we have the most powerful weapons in the world. I’m not even saying what kind. You don’t even want to know about it. And God help us if we ever have to use them. But we have the most powerful weapons ever conceived by man. They have the missile, the super-duper, hydro sonic, I call it the super-duper, it goes five times faster than a normal missile, right? We have one goes much faster than that. But Russia got that information from the Obama administration. Russia stole that information. You knew that. Russia got the information and they built it. But we have now one that’s much faster than that. That’s like a slow missile. That’s like considered a slow missile. But I said it was incredible. Two weeks ago I said, “We have the finest, the best, the most incredible, sadly, the most deadly, and we never want to use it, but we have the greatest weapons ever in history by a factor of 10, by a factor of 10.” And they went crazy. “He’s given away classified.” These people are sick. All I’m doing is saying that we rebuilt our military $2.5 trillion all built in the USA, every single ounce of it. We have fighter jet, F-35 that are so good, you can’t see it. And I went to see the program, and I met some of the pilots and these guys are better looking than Tom Cruise. They’re tougher. They’re stronger. They’re bigger. They’re more powerful. They’re smarter. And I like Tom cruise by the way, because you can’t get much better than Top Gun, right? Great movie. You can’t get better. I like Tom cruise. But these guys are better looking than Tom. They got that crew cut, they got the crap under their eyes, they got the whole deal. They’re smart as hell. So I said, “So captain, let me ask you, how good is the F-35?” “They’re really good Sir, best plane we’ve ever had all great.” I said, “How do you compare that with what Russia has?” “Well, ours is better for a specific reason, Sir. You can’t see it.” “What does that mean?” “Well, when we fight, they cannot see us, that we are so stealth.” Now that doesn’t mean in three years that it won’t be obsolete because that’s what happens. That’s the problem with that business. You come up with a new computer and two weeks later it’s obsolete. That’s why I always like real estate, and grab a piece of real estate. But no, it’s true. I wouldn’t be good in that business. You get to work, work, work, and then you’re starting the next one because the last one is gone. That’s why I always talk about walls and wheels. When the Democrats were saying, “Walls are old fashioned.” Well, they’re right about that. But they work. Remember that? All we had to go through in Congress? And that wall is going up, think of that. We’re building 10 miles a week, 10 miles a week of the top. And our numbers on the border are the best they’ve ever been. The best they’ve ever been. Well, we’re building 10 miles of wall a week. We’re up to about 330 miles, and we’ll have it finished very soon, and it’s having a tremendous impact on drugs. It’s having a tremendous impact on all of the different things. Human trafficking in women. It’s not even children. They’re trafficking women, it’s because of the internet. You think of that as almost an ancient kind of a crime, right? But it’s not. It’s a very modern crime and it’s an unbelievably profitable crime. They’re trafficking women, little bit children, but mostly women. Where they’ll put three or four women in the back in the trunk of a car and they’ll go through the border. They can’t do it anymore. And we’re catching them. We have people that do nothing but look for the traffickers. To me, the traffickers are the biggest scum of the world. And thank heavens for ICE, and thank heavens for border patrol because these people do a job that you don’t want. I know Mike doesn’t want it. You wouldn’t even be good at it, Mike, he’ll do a commercial about it. That’s what he’ll do. Does he have the longest commercials in history? I say, Mike Lindell. I say, Mike, the pillow man. I say, Mike is the single greatest purchaser of commercials in history. I want him to buy my commercials. I say, “You know, we spent $20 million, I sell like two commercials.” He spends $2 and he’s got the whole day on Fox. I said, let Mike buy our commercials. Will you? I don’t know what the hell you do, but whatever it is, you better tell me the secret. Greatest purchaser of commercials. But we have done some job with that. And the traffickers and drugs are way down. Now we got upset with the pandemic, but I watched Biden today talking about, “If only Trump moved one week sooner. One week.” So let’s go, ready? So, you know he was against the ban, right? Because he didn’t think we had a problem. So he was against the ban. He didn’t know that China was heavily infected. He doesn’t even know where China is, in my opinion. But he was against the ban. These guys write stuff out for him, and he tries to read it. Doesn’t do well with it. So he was against it, but now his new thing is, if only I moved one week earlier, but I was earlier than everybody. If you think about it. I had nice guy, Dr. Fauci, I had another nice, got a lot of doctors. They were all telling me, “No, no, you don’t have to do that.” Tom knows that very well. “You don’t have to do that, Sir. You don’t have to do that. You don’t have to do that at all.” And one of those things, I was very early and I banned and everybody admits that had I not banned highly infected Wuhan province, right? Highly infected, we would have had hundreds of thousands of more deaths. And then you had the chart. I put it up yesterday, I’m doing these news conferences. We’re finally getting the word across that we did a great job, but I’m doing news conferences now every day. I call them the highly rated news conferences. And I go before these crazy people, they’re screaming like maniacs. It’s not the way they treat Sleepy Joe. He’d melt. If they ever did a number on, this guy would be there he’d be laying on the floor crying, “Get me out of here, Darling. Where is my wife? Get me out of here, please, Darling. They’re so nasty to me today. What happened?” We go through it every single day. But you think about it, and he said, “If only Trump moved faster,” but he’s the one that two months later called me xenophobic, and he called me a racist because I was banning China, which was heavily infected. And then he said, “Don’t ban Europe.” Well, I looked at Italy, big problem. I love Italy. I love the people of Italy, but they were heavily infected. France, I looked at France, I looked at Spain, they even had spikes recently. Did you see? And we’re doing great. We’re rounding it with or without, but we’re going to have with, but you know, with his better, but with or without, we’re rounding that corner, and we’re rounding it fast and they don’t want to give us any credit because they want to keep this up ’til November 4th. And on November 4th, the press will probably say, let’s say something stupid happened. The press will say, “I got to admit he did a damn good job.” And the other clown will be in office. We did a thing called price transparency. I signed it. It’s effective, also very complicated. It’s on your medical. And we did price transparency. It’s the biggest thing. It’s bigger than healthcare. Where you see your prices. You can go now to hospitals, you can price operations, you can price everything. It’s a massive thing. The man who did it… And I took a lot of heat, and I’m doing favorite nations drugs, meaning whatever the lowest in the world is, we have to pay the same. That’s the good news. The bad news is the drug companies, the doctors everybody’s angry at me. Actually under price transparency, the good hospitals and the good doctors benefit tremendously, but the bad ones don’t, and you have price transparency. And it goes into effect on January 1st. Could you imagine if this sleepy guy gets in and they say like, February, March, April something. They say unbelievable what happened to prices, it’s dropping like crazy. And they’ll say, what a job he’s doing this president? And I’m the one that signed it. I said, could you put it into effect but statutorily? It has to mature, mature, mature. So the earliest I could get is January 1st. It’s like crazy. You know another one? I’ll give you another one. I’ll give you another one. So Air Force One, so that’s the 757, but they have a 747, which is the big Air Force One. I think that just disrespected the people of Minnesota today, they gave us the little one. No, actually it’s because of the runway. In fact, when we landed, they said, “Sir, we have a very short runway, could you please hold on? I said, “I trust these pilots.” By the way, these pilots are the best pilots. When you fly the president of the United States. Wait a minute, he’s waving from the window. When you fly the president of the United States, you are the best flyer. They take the best air force guys, they take the best Marines in the helicopters, Marine One. But when you’re flying these planes, you can land that sucker, you have no problem. There’s no, mishits. There’s no, “Let’s go around. I can’t quite make it, Sir.” These guys are phenomenal. You’ve got to see what they look like. Everyone’s in perfect shape. I look at him, central casting, every one of them they’re great. Thank you fellas. Thank you. But I’ll tell you a little story. So Air Force One is a very old plane. It’s beautiful, but it’s an old 747, right? It’s 31 years old and other people didn’t want to do it, but it was time to get a new one. It was time. You got to get a new plane. And actually Air Force One, I’ll give you a little secret, it’s actually two planes. They get two. It’s a hell of a way to travel. If one’s not working perfect, you use the other one. But they get two. So Air Force One, they negotiated a price and they had it down for $5.7 billion, that was not sounds expensive, and it’s ridiculous, but that was done by the Obama administration. It was done by the Obama administration. And that’s okay. But no administration Obama, Bush, they didn’t want to do it because it sounds luxury. But at some point you got to buy a plane for the country. And these Arab countries would have their beautiful 747, 800s, 900s pour in, and they were gorgeous. And believe it or not, the new plane is a much bigger plane. Much bigger wingspan, it’s a much more beautiful plane, it’s modern. I think of a 31 years old, Air Force One is 31 years old, the main Air Force One, not this. This is a great plane, but the big one 31 years old. So you’re representing the country, but they didn’t want to do it because it shows luxury. So I get to the office, I said, whatever happened to Air Force One, how’s it doing?” “Sir, we made a deal for a new one under the Obama administration.” “Oh, you did, good. How much?” “5.7 billion.” I said, “That’s a lot of money for [inaudible 01:24:27] for two planes, in all fairness. Now it’s very technical, there’s a lot of stuff. I won’t talk about it because I don’t want to give away any classified information. Just trust me, some more sophisticated sucker you’ve ever seen in your life. I think you’re getting into a plane that cost 5.7 billion. Right? But it’s the most sophisticated, two planes. So I said, “How much is it? A general came, and an air force general, great guy, handsome guy. They’re all so good looking these people. I said, “So general, what are we paying? What’s the price?” ” Sir, it’s $5.7 million and we’re ready to go, Sir, could you sign it?” It sounds like a lot of money to me, General, 5.7 million for two airplanes. Can we get a better price?” “No, sir. This was negotiated by the Obama administration. The Obama administration. This was negotiated, Sir, by Barack Hussein Obama.” And I said, “Oh, that’s good. It sounds very high. So here’s what I’m going to do. Tell Boeing we’re not taking the plane. We have no interest in, it’s too much.” This is what I did. By the way, this is one of many stories. Isn’t this better than going and saying, “I saved your Iron Range?” And I say, “But please remember I did this too.” And I can do away with this stuff, but I did this too. Please remember that because I have all this list of incredible things I’ve done for Minnesota, I won’t even touch it because frankly I’m tired of repeating what I’ve done for all these different states. I mean, I did all this stuff and then I hear I’m nine down. I don’t believe it by the way, suppression. So I said to the general, I said, “General, 5.7 billion, not million, billion. That sounds very high to me general. I bought a lot of planes in my life and a lot of helicopters. I know a lot about it. How could it be five?” “Sir, that’s the best price they could get. We only have one day to do it.” I said, “Cancel it General. Cancel the order.” It was signed actually. “Yes, Sir.” I said, “Do you have the right to cancel it?” “Yes, sir. I do.” We negotiated a great deal. I said, “Oh good. Cancel it.” “Yes, sir. I’m pleased to tell you something, Sir. We have a breakup fee. We made a great deal, Sir.” I said, “You did? Oh, you have a breakup fee. You mean you can’t just cancel it for nothing? Then cancel it. You don’t have to pay a breakup fee. I know about breakup fees.” “No, Sir, we have a breakup fee.” “Okay. How much is it?” “Sir, we can break it up for $250 million.” I said, “Wait a minute. So you mean to tell me that to cancel the order costs $250 million?” In other words, we give them $250 million, we get nothing. I said, “General, don’t cancel the order. Just tell him I’m very unhappy.” This is what these guys. They’re good businessmen, by the way. These guys, right here, Mike, they might be better than you. I don’t even know. He may be the next governor. Mike Landell, maybe you should run. You should run. He is my complete and total investment. You should run. He’d be a hell of a governor. At least, you know one thing. Minnesota would be well promoted. Mike, run for governor, please. So he says, “It’s $250 million. It’s 250, Sir, I’m so proud of that.” I said, “You may be proud, but I’m not.” So I said, “General, don’t give them notice because I don’t want to write a check for 250 and getting nothing. I don’t think I could explain that to the American public. So tell them you’re really unhappy, we’re not going to make the deal, but just do it verbally.” And, “Yes, sir.” And then I spoke to the head of Boeing, a very nice guy. They had some rough times since then. They had a couple of really bad things happen. Terrible, really terrible. This was early on before the problems that they had. But he is, he’s a high quality guy. And I said to him, “Dennis, we have to start it with a… It’s got to have a three on the front of it.” What do I know? I just know that if they’re 5.7, and if I do something with a three. He said, “No, I can bring it down to 5.5 billion.” So I say, “Well, that’s not bad. I save $200 million in about a minute and a half phone call. So so far I’m not good, but it’s not good enough. I’m not happy.” I said, “No, we got to really think about canceling it.” And I can’t go to Airbus, which is made in Europe. It’s a little hard, I got to go to their competitor. I can’t say I’m going to buy the Air Force One from a European company that doesn’t work too well. My only option was to say, “Look, I just don’t want to just put it aside.” He calls me up a few days later. “Well, we can do a little bit better than that.” I said, “Dennis, has to have a three in front of it, Dennis.” Got to have a three. Like a three, three anything, but got to have a three in front of it. So he said, “No, no, no.” After one month, we signed a contract for $3.9 billion. Same exact one. Actually slightly better, we got an extra generator. And then Boeing came to me, and I love to negotiate. I do. Got that from my father. My father was a good negotiator and I love to negotiate. So they came to me, “Sir, we can put an extra stairway.” This is the big 747. And remember this is a big, much bigger than the old 747. “Sir, it gets very windy up there. I noticed that your hair’s blown all over the place. But we can buy a stairwell for the plane. And it comes under, it’s like a corkscrew right at the bottom of the plane.” You’re very high off the ground, big, big thing. “And it opens up, and if it’s raining or windy, you’re covered, Sir, because it’s under the plane. You’re totally sheltered.” I said, “That sounds great. So it’s a corkscrew stairwell.” I said, “How much is that general?” “50.” I said, “50, what a deal, So for $50,000 I can get a stairway?” “No, sir. $50 million.” I said, “Forget about the stairwell. Forget it.” He said 50. I really thought he meant $50,000. So these are just some little stories. I guess I must like Minnesota to go on one of these deals. But boy, did you get your money’s worth tonight? Is anybody having a bad time? Did you get your money’s worth? Because you’ve heard the other one. We’ve done this, and we’ve cut your taxes, and we built up the military bigger and better. And we’re the number one in history in regulation cuts, which is the biggest thing. And the judges, which we’ve done at a level like nobody’s ever done, everything we’ve done. Nobody has done more in three and a half years, no administration three and a half. Those first three and a half years, nobody even comes close. And you know, it’s a funny thing. I say it all the time. I’ve been saying it for a long time and the fake news, nobody even questions me about it. And you know if I was wrong, they would, but they can’t question me because when you see right to try, we took care of our vets. We just got a 91% approval rating from the vets 91. It’s never happened before. We got choice approved, we got accountability approved, drugs are way down. We’ve got a little setback with this whole situation where these shutdowns cause a lot of problems with drugs, a lot of everything, but drugs were way down. We had our best year in the history of our country last year. And we’re going to have a better year coming up. That’s why you have an obligation to vote for the guy that got you there. And remember this, and I really appreciate this, thank you. But I appreciate this because nine democrat mayors of cities in the Iron Range have endorsed me over Sleepy Joe. What do you like better? Sleepy Joe or Slow Joe? What’s better? Let’s do a poll. We do a poll. We do a poll. I do free falls. You know, these polls, they charge you a fortune for this stuff. They interviewed three people and then they charge you a million dollars. We interviewed 233 people, I got thousands of people at least for free. What do you like better as nickname? Slow Joe or Sleepy Joe? So let’s go. Wait, Slow Joe first. Okay? So just scream if you like it. So you have a choice, Slow Joe, they’re both very appropriate. Slow Joe or Sleepy Joe, ready? Slow Joe. I think we’re going to have a winner here. Sleepy Joe. A lot of people say I’m too nice with Sleepy Joe, that I’m actually being too nice, I don’t know. He’s a sleepy guy, but Biden is going to shut down your Iron Range. Remember, it wasn’t just the tariffs I put on your competitors that were dumping iron ore and steel and everything else in our country like it was garbage. And it was garbage steel. It was all [inaudible 01:33:41] based steel, real crap. It wasn’t that, but when you think of it, they wrote it out. You didn’t have environmentally the right. Somebody said, “Oh, well he got a bit because he was good with negotiating with these other countries.” It wasn’t that. I opened it up. I signed an order. I signed an executive order because Obama took your Iron Range and Biden took your Iron Range away. And I’ll never forget. The day I did it, and Tom was there, a man, I don’t know who he is, he’s probably in this massive audience, but he came up to me and he was a rough guy and he never cried in his life, including at childbirth. He didn’t cry at childbirth, but he was crying. And he said, “Sir, you gave our life back to us because Obama took our heart out when he closed up the Iron Range.” He said you gave our heart back. It’s true. So I just want to thank those cities. When a democrat mayor, and we have now a lot of… Now we have additional. So these are democrat politicians and two weeks ago they endorsed us, and it’s a great thing. We’re finding that all over the country. Democrats for Trump. Politicians that got elected as democrats, I don’t think they changed their party affiliation, but they endorsed Trump. They’re all in the Iron Range area. And Larry Cuffe is here. Larry Cuffe. Where’s Larry? Where is he? Larry, how are you? Why did you do that, Larry? That’s so nice. I appreciate it. Boy, are you good. I wish you had a mic. He said, “Because you’re the best candidate we could ever…” I love this guy. Said you’re the best candidate we could ever hope for. Thank you Larry, that’s beautiful. I appreciate it. We’ll do a good job. We’re not going to let you down. And they’re doing a good job over there. So dig in, dig in, dig we must, right? It’s all going because of me. That’s cool, man. Thank you. No, he signed an executive order shutting it down. Just shutting it down. And I hear it’s got the best iron ore anywhere in the world. That’s what I hear. The quality is the best or anywhere in the world. That’s what I hear. The quality is the best. And it’s like an unlimited amount. I’m talking about a little, this is a massive operation with thousands of people and everything else. And for me, it was very easy. Andrea Zupancich, where is she? Where’s Andrea? Thank you very much. That’s really nice. I’m glad that at least you got a good location, right? That’s great. I appreciate it very much. You’re all friends I guess. Chris Vreeland, where’s Chris? Chris Vreeland. Chris? Where’s Chris? The mayor? Thank you, Chris. Thank you, Chris. Thank you very much. Kathy Brandau. Kathy Brandau. Thank you, Kathy. I hope you’re having a good time tonight. We’re not going to let you down. You know that. We’re open. That sucker is open. We’re not closing it. Well, think of this though. If Biden gets in, it’s closed. He said he’s going to close it. How about this guy? No fracking. You’re not going to frack. Onstage with all these crazy people and they don’t want any energy. They think everything’s going to run by wind, which costs you a fortune, about 20 times more than what we have and doesn’t work. But think of it, all of these people… And they say, “What about fracking? Fracking is the modern technology. And so they all said, “No, no, we’re all against… everyone’s against fracking. What about you?” Yes, I’m against it too. Now he’s against it for months. He gets it, now he’s in favor of it. But he’s sort of grandfathering it. You know, it’s a very weak… Well, I like to grandfather fracking. If I’m a fracker, I don’t want to be grandfather. I want to have it or not have it, right? He wants to grandfather fracking. Always go with their first statement, okay? So I was in Texas two weeks ago, we had crowds. Mike, we had crowds that went from the airplane to the well, to the drilling well, where we went to see a well. And we saved the industry because I got Russia and Saudi Arabia to cut back 10 million barrels. It actually was probably 18. Ended up being, I think, 18.5 million barrels. And it saved the industry. And yet you’re still paying very low gasoline prices at the pump, but we saved 10 million jobs. But I’m in Texas, and let me tell you, Texas appreciated it because that industry was in deep trouble because all of a sudden with the pandemic, there was no demand. There was nobody driving, there was no demand. Nobody ever saw anything like it. So I’m in Texas and I said to the crowd, it was a great crowd, and we must have had a hundred thousand people on the road, on the highways and roadways waving. And they had the most beautiful Trump flags. I wanted to stop, “Where did you buy that flag?” The most beautiful flags of me and our great vice president. Is Mike Pence doing a good job by the way? He did such a great… he worked 29 hours a day. I mean, this guy works day and night. He worked not the 24. He worked 24 plus least five, okay. This man is a worker and he’s a wonderful human being. And when they try it, a guy like Biden that can’t carry his jockstrap. When Biden goes, “Oh, they should have closed one week earlier”, and here’s the guy that said I made a mistake when I banned China that nothing’s going to happen. It’s so phony. This politics is a very phony business. I haven’t been doing it long. I told one of the senators that came in, he came into my office there, ” I’ve been doing this for 30 years. I’ve won many elections, I’ve only lost twice in my life. I’ve been a Senator for a long time. I know what I’m doing, sir”. I said, “Yeah, and I’ve done it for four years. And I’ve only won one election, but it’s for the president of the United States.” I remember a certain man on television that didn’t like me too much. He said, “They put together the greatest field ever assembled, the Republicans, remember? 17 plus me. They put together the greatest field of talent ever assembled. I hear Trump wants to come in. He’s not going to do it number one. Number two, if he does, he’s just doing it for fun and he’ll be out by September and then he’ll go about leading his life, but he’s not going to do it. But we don’t really need him because this is the greatest single assemblage of talent ever assembled for one party.” The greatest talent he’s ever seen. And then I did it and just week after week, one out, two out, three out, four out. And then we’ve done changes. Oh, he said, “He can’t do it because he doesn’t have any experience.” But I actually do on the other side. I contributed to politics. I always found it very interesting. So in a certain way, I had a lot of experience probably. Maybe I had too much experience. That’s why I can tell you about AOC. Check out the $2 million please, check it out, check it out. Check out Omar, check out Omar, get to that great writer, he should get… Oh, so the New York Times won all these Pulitzer prizes, right? I was going to tell you before. All these Pulitzer prizes, these people, and they all got it wrong, right? They got for Russia, Russia, Russia. We give the Pulitzer prize. I won’t use names. I won’t use names, but we give the Pulitzer prize to the New York Times. They got it wrong. We give the Pulitzer prize to the Washington Post and all of these real sleazebags. I have to be honest with you. Very dishonest people, very dishonest. I call it the Amazon Washington Post. He uses that as his lobbyist because he owns the Washington Post. He gets crap that other people wouldn’t get, okay. That means it’s a lobby. It’s a lobbyist deal. But they got the prize, right? They got the Pulitzer prize. All the guys that got it right, that really got it right, they all got it wrong, totally wrong. And they should return the Pulitzer prize. And Pulitzer association, the committee should ask for those prizes back. They got it all wrong. They were a hundred percent wrong. There was no collusion. They couldn’t believe. Remember the day when it was announced after three years, there is no collusion. I could have told them that a day one, they could have saved 48 million dollars. They got the Pulitzer. And then you take guys so many, so many. Solomon, Sara Carter, Bongino. How about Dan Bongino? So many, so talented guys. How about that great gentlemen who wrote The Witch Hunt? Remember that? That was the first, right? You know what I’m talking about. He’s fantastic. All great. These people should have won the Pulitzer prize. Now I would say Sean Hannity and Lou Dobbs and Laura and Tucker. In all fairness, Tucker was very good. Tucker was great, but these are all people that got it right. Now they don’t do I guess the Pulitzer prize for that stuff, but they probably should. But these guys all got it right. And all they did was get a lot of money because they’re very successful, and that’s okay I guess. But they should give the Pulitzer prize to the people that got it right and they should withdraw from all of those writers, many of whom are back there right now, all of those writers, they should do that. So just to finish up, just to finish up, I want to just say that we have some great congressmen here. I’d love you guys to come up here because I just want to have you come up. Would you come up? They deserve it. Because I told them, they’re busy guys, that they’re big warriors and all that. And I told them, “I’m going to introduce you right at the beginning. Be here, and then you can get out of here.” They’ve been waiting now for an hour and 20 minutes. Come on up. So just walk to the end, shake their hand. Everybody sign a slip that you’re voting for them, please. They’ve got no problem. But you have members of Congress here, Jim Hagedorn, Tom Emmer, Pete Stauber, great hockey player. And hopefully your next US Senator who’s a man who’s done a fantastic job, run a great campaign, Jason Lewis. And a candidate for Congress, Michelle Fischbach, who’s supposed to be fantastic. And Michelle has my complete and total endorsement. But Jason, you’re in good shape, wow. You’re in better shape than these Congressman Jase. By the way, Jason is fantastic and he’s doing a fantastic… Where’s Michelle? Is she there? Be careful. It’s not worth the broken legs. Look at her. Oh, she’s a warrior, I can tell. Come on up. But thanks, Michelle. And they have my complete endorsement. They’re great people. They love your state. They love our country. So just in conclusion, I want to say that over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we will end our reliance on China once and for all. We will make our medical supplies right here in the United States. And you probably heard me today. It used to be Puerto Rico did tremendous dollars in medical supplies. And then what happened? They made a lot, they did a good job, and Obama Biden destroyed it. They took away the incentive, all of the taxes. And they took away the incentive and Puerto Rico went down a long way. We’ll get some of that back to Puerto Rico and we’ll get it back for us. Take it away from China. You heard that, yes? They took it away. And then people automatically vote. It’s like a habit. Will I vote for the Democrat? The Democrat was so bad to you. And how bad were the Democrats to Israel? We did Jerusalem, right? We broke up the Iran deal, right? And then they vote for a Democrat. It’s out of habit, but I think the habits, we’re breaking those habits very quickly. But we’ve helped Puerto Rico and we’ve really helped… If you look at what we’ve done for Israel, it’s been incredible. They say nobody’s done more. And it’s my honor. But we’ll hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities, which are a disaster. We’ll appoint tough on crime prosecutors. We will nominate judges and justices who interpret the constitution as written. We will ensure equal justice for citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed. We will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. And that’s why the Supreme court is so important. The next president will get one, two, three, or four Supreme court justices. I had two. Many presidents have had none. They’ve had none because they’re there for a long time. They tend to be appointed young. They’re there for a long time. But the next one we’ll have anywhere from one to four. Think of that. That will totally change when you talk about life, when you talk about second amendment, when you talk about things that are so important to you. You’re going to be stuck for 40 years, 35 years, a long time. So this is going to be the most important election, in my opinion, in the history of our country. You got to get it right. Because if you don’t get it right, we will not have a country anymore. You’re not going to have a country. Not as we know it. You won’t have a country anymore. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens and we will keep America out of these ridiculous, horrible, endless foreign wars. Countries you’ve never heard of. Coming home. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military mind, and we will ensure peace through strength. This is what we have now. Peace through strength. Remember what I told you about those weapons, we don’t want to use ever, we don’t want to use those weapons. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency, January 1st. He doesn’t even have to do anything now. I’ll be so angry if he… They’ll say, “What a job he’s done on transparency, can you believe it?” And he won’t even know what transparency is. And it’s complex. And further reduce health insurance premiums and the cost of prescription drugs. We’ve done that already. We will strongly protect Medicare and social security, and we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions. America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. And we brought NASA back. NASA, when I got in three and a half years ago, grass was growing through the cracks of the runway. It was over, it was closed. It was nothing. Now it’s the number one space center in the entire world by a factor of five. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, in God we trust. You know that the Democrat national convention and the pledge of allegiance at a caucus, two of them, not one. I heard the first one, I said, “Oh, they must’ve made a mistake.” They left under God out of the pledge of allegiance. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now they then said, “Oh, well we didn’t mean that.” They meant it. That’s what they’re going to do. They’re going to take God out of it. Just like I was saying before, Texas, they don’t want God, they don’t want oil, they don’t want guns. I don’t think they’re going to do too well in Texas. Do you agree with that? I don’t think they’re going to do too well in Minnesota either. No, but could you imagine you’re campaigning, and it doesn’t play too well here, but could you imagine you’re in Texas and you have a guy say, “No oil, no God, no guns. Oh, I think I’m going to vote for Joe Biden, everybody.” And then they say, “Texas is in play, it’s a very close…” I have a friend in Texas. He said, “I think you’re winning by 15 points.” These people are crazy. Texas is in play. They don’t want to let you have oil. Think of it. It’s unbelievable. Texas is in play. That’s the fake news back there. They said it last time too. Remember? Texas, when they say in play, that means it’s too close to call. It’s in play. Too close. We’ve heard that for a long time, in play, right? Too close to call. And they said it four years ago, “Texas is in play. This could be a terrible defeat, losing Texas. Big state, great state. This would be a tremendous defeat.” And they said it about Ohio too. I think we won by like nine points. Right? They said Ohio is in play. Utah’s in play. We won by a lot. Remember we beat a guy named McMuffin. Remember the guy? He was going to take the state of Utah. And then he was going to be able to negotiate. But that didn’t work out. He came in third. Even Hillary beat him. But they said Texas is in play. And I’d go around telling my people, “Damn it, Texas is in play, how the hell? Every time I go there, I have 35,000 people at the stadium, how could it possibly be in play?” They said it’s in play. My people would say, “I don’t think so.” And we had a big Texas rancher. He was on one of the shows. He was wearing a big, beautiful hat. I wish I could wear those hots. It wouldn’t work for me too well. I don’t think it works for me, right? But it worked for him. And he said, “I don’t know too much about a lot, but I know one thing. Texas is not in play. And this guy is going to win Texas by a hell of a lot of votes.” And that’s what happened that night, the night of the election. The night of the election, they called the results. I’ve been listening for six months, “Texas is so close, we can’t even imagine it it’s so close. This is big.” And they only call the election immediately if you win in a landslide, it’s got to be tremendous. And they said, “Texas has closed its doors. Ladies and gentlemen, Donald Trump has won the state of Texas.” They didn’t even say the polls were closed. They forgot to say the polls were closed. I wanted to say. I said, “How come I won?” I called my people, “How could I have won? It was so close they called it before they even said the doors closed.” And I heard from the governor of Texas, great guy, Greg Abbott. I said, “How are we doing compared to four years ago?” We did great four years ago, big, big win. He said, “Sir, you’re doing much better.” But these guys keep saying it’s in play. It’s the same way that I’m down nine points in Minnesota. If I lose Minnesota, if I lose Minnesota, Jason, I’m going to blame Jason if I lose. Boy, we almost had it last time. But we did the right thing. We went to Michigan, we won Michigan, first time in many, many years, that Michigan was won. It’s a great state. For years you had a president who apologized for America. And now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for Minnesota. So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, and get out and vote. And you know it’s starting today in Minnesota. That’s why I’m here. It started today. Go out of here. You know what? If they’re closed, what the hell time is it now? If they’re closed, just stand in line like you do. People were here two days ago trying to get in here. It’s crazy. So do the same thing at the voting booth, please. From St. Paul to St. Cloud, from Rochester to Duluth, and from Minneapolis, thank God we still have Minneapolis, to right here, right here with all of you great people, this state was pioneered by men and women who braved the wilderness and the winters to build a better life for themselves and for their families. They were tough and they were strong. You have good genes. You know that, right? You have good genes. A lot of it’s about the genes, isn’t it? Don’t you believe? The racehorse theory you think was so different? You have good genes in Minnesota. They didn’t have a lot of money. They didn’t have a lot of luxury, but they had grit, they had faith, and they had each other. That’s what you have now. You have each other. They were miners and lumberjacks, fishermen and farmers, shipbuilders and shopkeepers. But they all had one thing in common. They loved their families, they loved their countries, and they loved their God. Proud citizens like you helped build this country. And together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we’re going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. And don’t forget, you went through years where you weren’t winning, right? Years and years, they closed down. Even with Obama, he closed that iron. I think he just wanted to get even with you, I don’t know. He wasn’t good. Not a good… We’ve knocked out about 84% of the things he did. Then you say, “I wonder if he likes me?” But you’re getting used to winning and you’re going to see winning like you’ve never seen before. You had your best year and you’re going to win so much. You’ve heard this, right? I haven’t said it in a long time because we’ve been doing a lot of winning, but you’re going to win so much. And you’re going to send Jason to the US Senate. And you’re going to keep winning and winning and winning. You’re going to win on trade, you’re going to win on the military. You’re going to win on everything you touch. Minnesota is going to keep on winning and you’re going to get tired of winning because Minnesota doesn’t want to win all the time. Your football team is going to win in the big 10 they say, right? No, we are going to keep on winning in Minnesota. And you’re going to get so tired you’re going to say, “Jason, Jason, please, please Jason, go to the president. See him in the oval office. Stop him from winning. We’re winning too much in Minnesota. We can’t stand it. Jason, please, please Jason. Stop him from winning so much for Minnesota. We can’t take it. We’re not used to it because we went through years and years and years where it was tough”, right? The mayors know that. That’s why they all endorsed the president. And I’m going to look at Jason, I’m going to say, “No, Jason, I’m sorry. The people of Minnesota want to win, you’re wrong, Jason. They want to win. We’re going to keep on going, Jason, we’re going to keep on winning. And they’re going to be happy as hell, Jason.” Get Jason in, he’s a great guy. By the way, you have a Senator that he’s running against. I won’t even mention names. She does nothing, nothing. Nobody even knows who the hell she is. She goes to a meeting the other day, everyone’s trying to figure out who is she? This guy… he even looks the role. Central casting, right? If you can get the look for free, that’s good too. Right? But he’s going to be fantastic. Tremendous guy, really successful. And he loves your state and he loves our country. So Jason, please knock them out. Knock them out. But you’re going to win. We’re one movement. We’re one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of Minnesota, and you know what’s going to be operating at strength? Because I owe it to these incredible mayors that were so nice to me. That was such a nice thing. And I didn’t politick you at all. I never politicked you. I said how nice. And it’s happening with so many other things. We have other endorsements from police forces that I never asked and all of a sudden they’re coming from very hostile territory. So I just appreciate your being here. And I’m saying this for you and I’m saying it for all of you. Okay. Thank you. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you Minnesota, thank you.

"64","09-19-20","What a crowd, what a crowd. Get those people over here. See me. Let them come over. What is a big crowd, it’s always big. We want to win. We got to win. We want to save our country from the radical left, the radical left crazies. Thank you very much. And hello, North Carolina, hello, North Carolina. We love you, North Carolina. I’m thrilled to be in Fayetteville with thousands of loyal, hard working American patriots. And you know what’s going to happen in 45 days from now, and you’re watching those polls. They go up, up, up up. 45 days from now, we’re going to win North Carolina. We’re going to win four more years in the White House. As we meet tonight, our nation mourns the loss of a legal giant Supreme Court Justice, Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Her landmark rulings, fierce devotion to justice and her courageous battle against cancer inspire all Americans. You may agree. You may not disagree with her, but she was an inspiration to a tremendous number of people. I say, all Americans Justice Ginsburg’s close relationship with a friend of ours, a friend of mine, Justice Scalia, is also a powerful reminder that we can disagree on fundamental issues while treating each other with decency, dignity, and respect. Our thoughts and prayers are with her family. Thank you very much. So Article II of our constitution says the president shall nominate justices of the Supreme Court. I don’t think it can be any more clear, can it? I don’t think so. I don’t think so. What do you think, Thom? Thom Tillis, I don’t think it can be any more clear. This can only happen in North Carolina. I hope you hear that back home. Look at all that press. That’s a lot of press. That’s a lot of fake news. Well, I hope they hear. So the chant, this is a new one. Fill that seat. This is the chant. This can only happen to me. Fill that seat. Now it says the president is supposed to fill the seat, right? And that’s what we’re going to do. We’re going to fill the seat. I love that chant. We hear more chants, there’s a lot of genius in those chants half the time. You said it better than you can say it. You can read a speech. But what’s better than those words, fill that seat. You know what you do? You come up, you say, “Fill that seat,” you leave and you’ve said everything. You don’t have to. There have been 29 times the vacancy opened during an election year or prior to an inauguration. 29 times, that’s a lot. Every single time the sitting president made a nomination. That included, did you ever hear of George Washington? Did you ever hear of Thomas Jefferson? Or how about the great Abraham Lincoln when he wore the hat [inaudible 00:20:13]. With a great hat. I want to try one of those hats. I love that. No, think of it. 29 times, every single time nobody said, “Oh, let’s not fill the seat.” We won the election. Now then we have some senators that, forget it. Think of it, I won’t say it. I won’t say it, Susan. I won’t say it, Susan. But Thom Tillis is with us. I can tell you that. Great. We have great Republican senators. We have great people and we have a great country. That’s really, we have a great country. And we’re going to keep it that way. So we win an election and those are the consequences. It’s called fill that seat and that’s what we’re doing. The Supreme Court was a very central issue in both the 2016 presidential election and then the 2018 midterm elections where, by the way, I didn’t run. We had a lot of people, a lot of people said, “Oh, he really took a little bit of a shellacking.” Not nearly as bad as others. In fact, we gained seats in the Senate, but they never talk about that. They don’t talk about that. We gained two seats. Nobody talked about it. But we didn’t run. And I had a lot of people that, “Sir, we’ll never vote in 2018.” I said, “No, no vote, everybody vote. They just didn’t. I think we were like 9 million people decided they wanted to wait and they’ve waited and you see what’s going on. You see what’s happening. You see the enthusiasm that we have. Which, by the way, we set a record in 2016. The bad news for the Democrats is we are more enthusiastic now. Not even close, than we were in 2016. We are getting crowds and this is pandemic and we’re rounding the turn. We’re rounding the corner of the pandemic. But we’re having them outside. And we shouldn’t say this is some kind of a rally from now on. It’s called a protest. We are protesters. We’re going to call on our rallies that because you see a lot of these, let’s call them blue states, we want to be nice. We’re going to call it a protest against stupidity. So we are going to have protests against stupidity. Because a lot of the people like in Michigan and other places, we love Michigan, but the governor’s got them shut down. I hate to say it, your governor’s got you shutdown. It doesn’t look it here. But your governor has got you shut down. I don’t know, you’re not breaking a law by being here. Otherwise, if you are, we’ll have to do something about that because this is a hell of a shutdown. I think your governor has to let this state open up. And Pennsylvania. Look what they’re doing in Pennsylvania. A great state, that’s actually something very special is going to happen here, in Pennsylvania. That’s a commonwealth. We always have to remember Pennsylvania, commonwealth. Got two of them and you better remember you get in trouble. But we love Pennsylvania. And it’s a shut down. The governor’s got it just shut down nice and tight. And you know what? On November 4th, it’s going to be opened up. Because they’re trying to hurt our numbers. But our economic numbers are so good. They’re staggering. They’re the best we’ve ever had. Jobs, retail, stock, market, everything. And this is with a lot of shutdowns by Democrats. That’s all they’re doing. On November 4th, they’ll announce, “We’ve decided to open up.” One of the teachers groups said, actually, one of the unions and one of the politicians in California said, “No, we’re not going to do it. We need to do it. We should be open by November 4th.” That was not a good thing for them to say. That person I think was fired, I think was fired. In both the 2016 and the 2018 elections, the American people chose a president and a Senate majority united in their commitment to selecting nominees who believe in applying the Constitution as written. Both the White House and the Senate majority have a moral duty to fulfill the promises they made to the voters. And that is exactly what we’re going to do. We said that if for any reason, we have a vacancy on the United States Supreme Court, we will fill that vacancy. We’re not going to say, and by the way, we have plenty of time. There’s a lot of time. You’re talking about January 20th. So we will uphold equal justice under the law for citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed. I won’t be putting forth a nominee next week. It will be a woman. It will be a woman unless, wait, okay, let’s do a poll. Oh, there they are. How many of these have you come to? Speaking of women, how many of, what is this number one? Like 90, they’re great. North Carolina, though. I see them all over the place, they’re great. Anyway, I hope your husbands are okay with it. Are they okay? They’re okay. You have good husbands. But we’re going to do a vote. So I said, I love these free polls because pollsters and most of the pollsters are corrupt as far as I’m concerned. If we believed in pollsters we wouldn’t be here right now. But we’re actually getting very good. We just had a 53 from Rasmussen, which is very good. Considering we won four years ago with a lot lower than 53. History has shown that when you’re at 53 you can’t lose an election. Has anyone ever lost an election with a 53? The answer is yes, when the other side cheats. That could happen, that could happen. That could happen. You saw what happened in Pennsylvania. Some state supreme court justice just ruled that they can take as long as they want to count the ballots. That means I’ll be leading and winning Pennsylvania like we did last time. Yeah, yeah. We’ll be leading, we’ll be winning Pennsylvania. We’re going to win it easy. We’re going to win your state easily. I just came off the plane with, by the way, our great chief of staff, Mark Meadows. Did anybody ever hear of Mark? And Deb, what a great, she’s doing such a good job. But Mark, just a few months ago, I’ve been trying to get him for three years to leave and we have a great person running as you know. Really, I mean really great. Does everyone know Madison? Yes? You’re going to vote for Madison? He’s great. He’s a great guy. But Mark had a beautiful head of black hair and I just noticed that hair’s turning white very fast. But we’re doing a job. We’re very close to a great deal with TikTok, TikTok but nobody cares about that anymore. All they care about is fill that seat, right? Until about 24 hours ago, that’s all they talked about is TikTok, TikTok. We have a deal worked out, I think with Walmart is going to buy it along with Oracle. Larry Ellison, it’s going to be an incredible combination. And I said, “Do me a favor. Could you put up $5 billion into a fund for education so we can educate people as to real history of our country, the real history, not the fake history.” Because we’re getting very close to that deal. And all of the technology will be maintained here. They’re going to move probably to the great state of Texas. Sorry, we got you a lot of business when it came… but they’re going to move into the United States, which is what’s important. They’re moving to the United States, unbelievable company. They’re going to have 25,000 jobs. If it all goes, I gave them the preliminary approval. But they’re putting up $5 billion. And my only problem is they did it so fast. I should have asked for more. What happened is when I suggested they should put up a lot of money everybody said, senators, congressmen, women, everybody. They said, “You can’t do that. That’s never been done.” That’s the problem, nothing’s ever been done. And we had other companies, a lot of people wanted it. And I said, “You got to put up $5 million either to the Treasury of the United States maybe or into some education fund or do something.” And they were sort of agreeing with me. They thought it was okay. And then I went to the legal legals here and I said, “They’re going to put up $5 million, give it to the United States.” “Sir.,You can’t do that. There’s no provision.” I said, “How the hell can there be no provision. We’re making the deal possible. Why can’t they give us $5 billion dollars?” That’s b, that’s a lot of money. Now, watch the crazy Democrats. They’ll go, “They should have gotten more money.” It’s never been done before. They should have, no matter what you do. They should have gotten more. Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, crazy Nancy. But I’ll tell you. And I said it last night, we had a great rally. Last night, you saw that in a place that we’re going to win. We’re going to win Minnesota. Hasn’t been won since 1972. And they’re all saying, “Well, we did give them back the big iron ore range.” It was, Obama took it away with the stroke of a pen. He put everybody out of work. We gave it back. But I’ll tell you what, we’re going to have a victory on November 3rd, the likes of which you’ve never seen. Now we’re counting on the federal court system to make it so that we can actually have an evening where we know who wins. Not where the votes are going to be counted a week later or two weeks later. But in just three and a half years under my administration, we’ve secured America’s borders rebuilt the awesome power of the U.S military, think of that. And I shouldn’t say this and the fake news keeps going, “Oh, he’s given away classified information.” No I’m not. We are building and we have built weapons the likes of which this world has never seen before. And I said that a week ago and it was a headline and one of these fake newspapers where, “He’s giving away confidential information,” these people are crazy. No, no. I’m just telling you that President Putin and President Xi of China, Russia, China, North Korea, everybody. They are so envious of what we’re doing. They can’t even believe it. If they know, they perhaps don’t know. Under Obama, they knew immediately, okay. Under us, but we are building weapons, all made in the USA. The likes of which no country has ever seen before. And hope to God, we never have to use them. That’s the key, I don’t ever want to use them. Remember, I was supposed to be a guy that was going to get us into a war in the first week. Remember that? Where’s the war? We’re taking them out of Afghanistan. We’re almost finished with that. Working along well. We’re taking them out of Syria, other than I left some behind for the oil, we kept the oil, is it okay that we kept the oil? Is it okay we kept the oil? Let’s go back to my poll. Ready? So we’re putting, I think it should be a woman, because I actually like women much more than I like men, I have to say. No, I do. I do, I like women more. So I have to make a decision, to fill the seat, as we say, we should have a new campaign. Let’s make a t-shirt, fill the seat. Okay? My people are so good, tomorrow, it’ll be all over the place. That’s a good idea. That’s a good idea. Fill the seat. Okay watch this, so good tomorrow you’ll see them all over the place, fill the seat. I don’t know how the hell they do it, but they get it done fast. You remember I said, where’s Hunter? Where’s Hunter? The next day, it was like one of the biggest selling t- shirts where is Hunter? What the hell ever happened? He took the money and he ran I think. Where’s Hunter? He took the money, he went to China, he took 1.5 billion. He had no experience. He didn’t have a job until this guy became vice president. Then he went to China, he got $1.5 billion. I asked the head of a great company, Blackstone. One of the biggest in the world. I said, “Steve, let me ask you a question. Is that possible?” “No, that’s never done.” China doesn’t do that. Well, how did a guy with no experience do this? He said, “Very simple. His father’s vice president.” Is that what you want? And then Ukraine, $183,000 a month, and a $3 million upfront payment for him and his friends, think of this, with no experience and no job, and they said, do you know energy? It’s an energy company that paid it. Do you know energy? No, I don’t. I’ve not familiar with the subject. Our great Congressman. Right? How the hell does this happen? I think it will be brought up into debate. I think it will be brought up in the debate, I think. Where is Hunter? Where is Hunter? You know where Hunter is? He’s probably on the Riviera having a very good time. He’s giving some great energy advice. He’s learning. He’s taking a night class on energy for 180 grand. Where is Hunter? They’re corrupt. Remember Joe with a prosecutor? $ 1 billion, I’m not giving it to them until they get those prosecutors away from my son or whatever the hell he said, that crazy company over in Ukraine. $1 billion. I’m not giving it. You get them out. And guess what? They got them out. Here’s your billion dollars. Now that’s called quid pro quo. Right? That’s the real deal. With us, there was none. They made it up. Remember when Shift made the phony speech? Eight times he said the same thing, except that’s not what happened. Fortunately, we had those wonderful people that write every perfect word, every word. I’m glad we had them because we’re dealing with a bunch of thieving bad people. So women and men, ready? Would you rather have a woman on the Supreme Court or would you rather have a man? Ready? A woman or a man. So, would you rather have me choose, this is a very scientific poll. Actually, it’s a lot more accurate than these polls that interview like 97 people have been interviewed, then they charge you a million dollars and they probably don’t interview the people. They sit behind their desk. Would you rather have a woman on the Supreme Court? Yes, woman. Yes? Tom tiller says yes. Or would you rather have a man on the Supreme Court? What’s going on? Let’s give it one more quick chance. This is a free poll. And this is a lot of people. This is tens of thousands of people. This is a lot of people. You know, the fake news, they’ll say, “He had a smattering of people.” If Bernie Sanders had a crowd. Oh, he had a massive crowd. It was so big. With me, my crowds are five times bigger than Bernie’s. And they’ll say, “He had a smattering of people.” They were in the middle of an airport that nobody ever heard of. Thousands. If those people, come on, bring them over. What the hell, at this point, might as well, let them come on over. Come on over. You got thousands of people behind these people. I would imagine the sight lines aren’t too good. You have stands in front. Okay. So one more time. Who would rather have a man on the Supreme Court? Who would have a woman on the Supreme. Now tomorrow, like fake news, CNN, he was playing games with the United States. It is a terrible thing he’s done. No, I’m just taking a poll, please. And by the way, that’s a very accurate poll, because that’s the way I feel. It will be a woman, a very talented, very brilliant woman. Who I haven’t chosen yet, but we have numerous women on the list. I built this incredible list of brilliant people. And we’re asking for Biden’s list. He can’t give it. You know why? Because if he ever gave a list, he’d either put somebody in the left middle, which would be okay. You could get votes, or he’d put one, somebody, which is what he’s going to choose, so far left, now, if he did the left middle, he loses his entire left coast. Right? And if he loses the left coast, that’s the end of his election. And last time, remember how many people I got from Bernie, because of trade. A lot of the Bernie people vote for us because Bernie is right about one thing, trade. But Bernie took a bad defeat, didn’t he? It was a bad loss. He’s one of the most gracious losers I’ve ever seen, he is. All Elizabeth Warren, Pocahontas had to do is leave. If she left before Super Tuesday, Bernie would have won every one of those States, but they split up that vote. That’s too bad, but we have Sleepy Joe, we’ll see how that works out. I think it’s working out pretty good. We were winning so much, we didn’t even have, we could have called off the election. We were winning by so much, and then the plane came in from China. And in many ways, I had to go back to work, but I had to go back to work on this one too. And now we’re going up and up and up and we’re winning and we’re winning all over the place. Because I happen to think, I just say what I want. And you know, they make up a lot of false stories. They will make up a lie. Like what I said about military. Can you imagine? No animal would say that. They make it up and then they put it in ads. So once they did that, the only good thing is I can say, I said, “Now I can say anything.” He is the worst candidate, the dumbest of all candidates, but he was dumb in prime time, as told to me by a Senator from long ago, he said, “Who’s the dumbest in the Senate, who’s the smartest in the Senate?” The smartest is, I won’t tell you. But the dumbest is Joe. I said, “Who’s Joe.” He said, “Joe Biden.” That was 25 years ago. That was in prime time. He is the worst candidate in the history of presidential politics. If I lose to him, I don’t know what I’m going to do. I will never speak to you again. You’ll never see me again. No, how do you lose? He is honestly, I go up and these guys are grilling me all the time. Stephanopoulos grill, grill. Okay. It’s all right. It’s okay. I think it came out very, well it’s always, it comes out well. You have to be able to answer. They’re very weak compared to some of the foreign people that we deal with from foreign countries, leaders of foreign countries. But I say he’s always using a teleprompter. I don’t care if he uses a teleprompter, you know what bothers me? That means the fake news is giving him the questions. So that’s what really… they never gave me the questions. If I ever said, in fact, I’m going to say it now. I want from now on you to give me the questions before you ask me. And I’m going to read the questions off the teleprompter, and the questions are so easy. Did you see Anderson Cooper? He’s a nice guy. He’s interviewed me over the years, a lot, but he’s a tough interviewer. Did you see those softballs? What do you think Donald Trump is a very bad human being. Do you agree with that? Yes, I do, Anderson. I’ve never seen softballs, and actually they’re getting hit by it. They’re getting hit by it. It’s just a terrible thing. I mean, this is a guy, I used to call him 1% Joe, because he ran numerous times and he could only get 1%. In fact, he actually had 1% with an arrow pointing left. That means less than one. Now he’s shot, he’s got half of his head left, and he’s out, think of it. He’s totally shot. And he ends up getting the nomination. He couldn’t get it in prime time. What the hell is going on with the world today? What’s going on? What’s going on with the world, Mark Meadows? Unbelievable Meadows, oh boy. He’s a smart guy, Meadows, great, great guy, North Carolina, in just three and a half years, we obliterated the ISIS caliphate. Remember when I had it down to 99%, they said, “You got to finish it.” I said, “Let somebody else finish it.” And we went, and we finished it. We fixed our disastrous trade deals, which we have. China’s now paying us billions and billions of dollars. But you know, I view it differently now, I view China much differently now, after the plague came in, I view it differently. And we brought your jobs back home to North Carolina and our contract. In three years of President Trump, real median household income rose by almost $7,000. Now think of that, three years, three years, right? Achieving the highest median income in the history of our country. This is in three years. Under 16 years of presidents, Barack Hussein Obama, ladies and gentlemen, is President Barack Hussein Obama, or as Rush Limbaugh, the great, how great is Rush? Do we love Rush? As Rush Limbaugh would say, Barack Hussein Obama. You ever hear Rush? Barack Hussein Obama. Rush is great. He’s doing well too. He’s great. He’s a tough guy. We love Rush. We love you Rush. He watches every one of these rallies. You know, he supported me when I came down with our great first lady, I came down the escalator. I made a speech. I didn’t even have a speech writer, I had to wing it. The winging speeches are the best ones like last night. But Rush said, “I like that guy. I’d never heard that before. I’d never heard we’re going to build a wall.” We’re going to have secure borders. We’re going to make new trade deals that are like sane. We’re going to do all the things we’re going to rebuild our military. We’re going to have a strong country again. We did so many things, and Rush heard this. I didn’t know Rush. I mean, maybe I met him once, twice, for two seconds. And he became an instant fan of Trump. And he was for a long time before I even got to know him. And he’s been so important, he’s the King, 39 million listeners. There’s nobody like him. Try sitting down for what is it? Three hours? And talking, just talking with everyone. 39 million people, often. Try sitting. We love Rush. I love Rush. But listen, try sitting down with a radio show with millions and millions of people listening, and talk for three hours without phone calls. Phone calls are easy. Hey, what do you think of this? What do you think. Just talk. Talk. And everybody finds it fascinating. And it is fascinating. I wish I had time to listen more often. It’s a little tough as president, but everybody finds it fascinating. And we gave Rush, because he’s such an important person and done such an incredible job the Presidential Medal of Freedom. And Catherine, his wife is great. What a couple. But Rush has been unbelievable. He’s so on our side. And he was from literally day one, right from the beginning. And we don’t have to mention Sean, and Laura, and so many others. We don’t have to mention Lou, the great Lou Dobbs, right? I mean, Lou Dobbs said, Lou started years ago, and he liked us from the beginning. He said, “Donald Trump is going to be a very good president.” Okay. That was the first little time. Then he went, “Donald Trump. I love Donald Trump, but he’s the best since Ronald Reagan.” Then he went, “Donald Trump is an even better president than Ronald Reagan.” So that was about a year and a half into it. Then the great Lou Dobbs said, “Donald Trump may be the greatest of all time. Greatest of all time.” And then somebody said, “Can I ask you Lou, when you say the greatest, does that include Abraham Lincoln and George Washington?” He said, “Absolutely. He’s now the greatest of all time.” So we love Lou Dobbs. Lou Dobbs is great. Go out and buy his book. His book is great. But we have great support. We have great support. Tucker’s been very good lately, I have to tell you. Tucker has been very good. Tucker Carlson, he’s come a long way, actually the whole thing with faking around with our whole history. He’s very strong in that, we took care of that very powerfully, very powerfully. We signed an executive order. We fired a lot of people that were talking about cancel culture and a lot of fake stuff, that were getting paid a lot of money that we’re here for a long time. Under 16 years of presidents Obama and Bush, the median income only rose $2,900. Now think of that. So three years, it went up $7,000, 16 years, it went up less than $3,000. I’d say that’s a big difference. And that’s not including energy, because look what you’re paying for your gasoline now. Right? Remember those days? Remember those days of $5, you said, “Let’s get rid of that big truck.” Now you’re all buying bigger trucks than they ever thought possible. You know why? Because gasoline is so damn cheap, right? Remember the $5 days? Now you’re below $2 a lot, right? Below two. I mean, they’re seeing numbers that nobody believes. It’s all good stuff. And we’re energy independent. So many things have happened. If you add four or $5,000, so you’re talking about by $11,000, you got to add the energy. I said to my people, “Put the energy in.” “Well, I don’t know if it’s right.” I said, “Do me a favor, just put it in.” In my first three years, we lifted 6.6 million people out of poverty, the largest poverty reduction of any president in American history. We built the greatest economy in the history of the world. And now we’re doing it again, and we’re doing it very rapidly. This is a super V. They said, “Oh, I don’t know, V is going to be very hard.” No, this is a super V. We will deliver a safe and effective vaccine this year. It’s already in very good shape. Very, very good shape. In a matter of weeks. We will end the pandemic from China. We will end our plague from China. Next year will be one of the greatest years in the history of our country, it’s heading that way. If you take a look, automobile manufacturing, housing, retailing, they’re all setting records, they’re through the roof, hard to believe, actually, during the rounding the corner, when I say rounding the corner, they go crazy. They want to keep it going as long as possible. If you say anything positive, they say, “He’s not telling the truth to the American public.” I am actually telling the truth. You know these people, they talked about, because I said, “Well, Winston Churchill was a great leader.” They said the other night, “You said Winston Churchill was a great leader, but he didn’t lie.” Because this guy, Woodward. He writes a book. He’s had it. He’s another one shot. I compare him sort of to Biden. He’s sharper than Biden, I have to say that, but he’s shot. He’s tired. He’s exhausted. I never saw a guy be able to do so much television, try doing a book on somebody else. See how much television time they give you, like none. But they said the other night, and it was amazing. Winston Churchill. They said, “He didn’t lie to the people, to Britain. He didn’t lie.” I said, “Well, let me ask you this. He stood on buildings when the Nazis, Hitler, were bombing London.” That’s pretty brave, because he may have been doing a little drinking, but he was known for that, right? He’s got a right to, but it’s true. He stood in the buildings in London, as they were bombing London, and made speeches, and made statements, and had everything. And he’d sometimes have press conferences. And the fake news wouldn’t show up. He was standing there, nobody was in front of him. But he would stand there, and he would say, “You are safe. You are safe. Everything is okay. You are safe.” Well, that’s a lie, I guess, right? So I said, “Oh, I never thought of it that way. I guess he lied.” No, he’s a great leader, and he was leading, and he was a great, great prime minister. He did a fantastic job. Not lying. No. We love our country, we want to lead our country, and we can’t let a thing like this, this is a horrible, horrible thing that happened to the world it happened, should have been stopped in China. They stopped it from going into the rest of China, should have been stopped in China. To defeat the China virus, we launched the largest industrial mobilization since World War II. Somebody said, “What grade would you give yourself?” I said, “A+.” But I would give myself a D, I would say I would give myself, and my whole group, because Mike Pence is great, Mike Pence really was. He worked so hard. And it’s unfair, he worked so hard. The ventilators, the vaccines, the therapeutics now we have, look at what’s happening. When somebody gets very sick, look how we bring them back so often, compared to what it was originally. I mean, the work that’s been done, and wait until you see what happens over the next few weeks with what’s going on. But the Democrats don’t want the vaccine. They don’t want it. At first, they wanted a vaccine, because they didn’t think it could happen. Now that we have it, they’re going like, “Well, we don’t want it.” It’s the craziest thing. Think of it, you want to get a vaccine, and they’re willing to hurt people, let people die for political reasons. Think of it. I think, honestly, I think it’s a disgrace. But we surged rapid testing kits. We have more testing than all other, I mean, practically everybody. You look at number two is India. They have 1.5 billion people. We are up 50 million tests more than India. In fact, we’re about to crack 100 million tests. And when you test, then you have, does this make sense? Then you have cases. So we do all this testing, and I come home and I turn on NBC News. It is so bad. I think NBC, that’s not only MSDNC. I think NBC with Lester Holt. There’s another beauty. Hi Lester. How do you feel big in second place Lester? He surged from first place to second place. But NBC News is so, I mean, it’s just terrible. They use free airwaves, and then they give you fake news. Free airwaves. They should pay a lot of money for this. This is not right. NBC. It’s owned by a company called Concast, C-O-N, Concast, they’re con, they’re con men. It’s a disgrace. They spend fortunes on public relations and then I get up and make a speech like this with television blazing all over the world, I guess. Yeah, the world, it’s all over the world. And I say Concast, and immediately, there goes their public, how’s your public relations doing NBC? Not too good. But they’re just… they don’t tell the truth. Our country would be so much better off if we had honest media, really. Really would. And do you see what their approval rating has gone to? I think it’s one of my greatest achievements. Hey look-It’s a Saturday night. We have all night. This happened last night in Minnesota. I have these teleprompter people, they’re great, they’re genius. And I was about 45 minutes into the speech, and I realized I was only on line two. And he was like, “What do I do?” But we have more fun. Hey, you now have a president that doesn’t have to use a teleprompter, isn’t that nice? And I said last night, I said, and yeah, your friends were there. The Congressmen. By the way, is the media now, and I’m pretty sure it’s getting close. I think they have a lower approval rating than Congress. Congratulations. No, but it’s hard. When you’re sitting there, you’re in businesses, you’re in construction, you drive trucks, you do a lot of things. You’re in offices. You don’t realize, because you don’t know what’s happening. I know exactly a true story. And then it’s written to totally bend the truth, to make a good thing into a bad thing. Like, can you believe it, in one week they nominated me, not for one, but for two Nobel prizes. No, but think of it. No but think. And they didn’t cover the story. Now Obama got his the first week. Very liberal group, and nobody knew what the hell he got it for, and he didn’t know. Why did you get it? I don’t know. Remember? I don’t know. I have no idea. But you know, you have a president, you love your president, and your president gets honored, because I’m not being honored, you’re being honored with the Nobel Peace Prize, for Israel, what we did with Israel. I went home and I said to the First Lady, “Darling,” she’s very popular. She made a great speech, right? And Ivanka made a great speech, right? But I went home. I said, “Darling, I have big news tonight. Let’s turn on the television.” You know, we don’t use wind. We use actually, we actually use petroleum. We use Petro. Because we like it to be on like a lot. We don’t like to have lots of open gaps when the wind’s not blowing. We can’t watch President Trump. I go home. I say, “First Lady, a great thing happened today. I was honored, Nobel Peace Prize, nominated. This is a big thing First Lady.” And then I went home two days later. I said, “First Lady, you’re not going to believe it. I was honored again. Nobel Prize, that’s Kosovo.” Israel, Kosovo. I said, “First Lady, this is great news. Let’s turn on the television. This is going to be big. This is going to be big tonight. We just got honored, this is big.” Nobel Peace, can you imagine? You grow up in Brooklyn, Queens, and now you’re getting the-“First Lady, let’s turn on the television. Let’s turn onto that fake NBC news.” And I see we have a storm. “Okay, First Lady, don’t worry about it. The storm is big. We have it taken care of, FEMA’s down there, Florida, Alabama, Georgia. We got FEMA down there. It’s being taken care of. We always take care of it. We take good care of it.” Texas, Louisiana. We took good care of him two weeks ago. “All right First Lady, don’t worry about it. It’s the next story, I’m sure, it’s the Nobel Prize for peace.” We’re stopping mass killings between Kosovo and Serbia. They’ve been killing each other for so many, they’re going to stop killing. I said, fellas, let’s get together. They’d been doing it for hundreds of years, frankly, under different names. I said, that’s great. And with Israel, UAE and Bahrain signed a deal with Israel. Everybody said it couldn’t be done. I said, “All right, First Lady, that’s the first story on NBC, but don’t worry. That’s a big story. The floods are big. I see it.” And then there was a second story about something. And then their third story is about something with me, I don’t know, something bad they found out. Then there was a fourth and a fifth and a sixth. I said, “First Lady, I’m a little embarrassed. I thought we’d do a little better.” And then they looked at the screen, and said, “Good night.” And I wasn’t covered. I got the Nobel Peace Prize nomination, a Peace Prize, Nobel nomination. And they didn’t cover it. And then the following day I watched a certain show that does like us, and they said, “Would you believe, that they covered, and they mentioned like five subjects that were nothing. That was 18 minutes. And the Peace Prize Nobel version, zero time for President Trump. Thank you very much fake news media, we appreciate it. And when Obama got it, here are the headlines. President Obama gets the Nobel Prize. We need an honest media. The free airwaves, they lie over the free airwaves. They use them and they lie. I don’t know. We’re going to have to look at it. They’re a bunch of scoundrels. They hate it when I say it, but you know, honestly, they are the enemy of the people. When they lie, they are the enemy of the people. You are the enemy of the people. Oh, damn it. The red lights just went off. One, two, three, there’s one back there, there’s one back there, probably, oh it’s OAN, thank you OAN. Every time I get on this subject, they cover me not because they want to, but we get great ratings. We get ratings. These little deals that we have here, come on in folks, come on in. Look at these people. But you know what? I’ll tell you what, it’s true. They cover it because… But anytime I start talking about the fake news media, you see them getting a little tentative. The camera starts to shake a little bit, and you know, there’s another thing. Look at this crowd. It’s as far as the eye can see, it’s a big crowd, right? They never cover it. I said to my wife last night, we had this incredible crowd. A lot of people, thousands and thousands. I mean like 25, 30,000, many people outside couldn’t get it. It was like a sea of people. My wife said, “Was it a large crowd?” I said, “Did you watch?” “Yes. But they only show your face.” And I saw people they never show. And that includes Fox, which has changed a lot, changed a lot, sad. Somebody said, “What’s the biggest difference between 2016 and now?” You know what I said, “Fox.” Biggest difference. Biggest difference. I don’t know what’s going on with them. But we have some great ones too on Fox. We surged rapid testing kits to every nursing home in America. We learned a lot, through pioneering therapies, we reduced the fatality rate by 85% since April. Think of that? 85%. We’ve come up with things. They’re waiting to see what’s coming over the next few months in terms of therapeutics, which to me is even more important than the vaccine. You go into the hospital, you make people better. You give them a shot, you do a transfusion. You make people better. They walk out, that’s to me even better, but ultimately long-term, those vaccines are going to be great, and they’re really working out well and it’s going to be really soon. The people in certain groups are trying to hold them up as long as possible, as long as possible. They’re going to try and give Sleepy Joe the credit. He doesn’t even know what a vaccine is. Europe is almost 30% higher excess mortality than the United States. Does anyone know that? they don’t report that, right? Europe? Europe’s had a hard time. I’m not looking to hurt them, but they have 30% higher. Our bold and early action saved millions of lives and our decisive economic response saved tens of millions of jobs, including 1.3 million jobs, and a wonderful place called North Carolina, right? When I banned travel from China in January, Sleepy Joe Biden called it, “That’s hysterical. That’s xenophobic.” What does that mean? Tell me what xenophobic means, Sleepy Joe. Who said that? I mean, you're my friend. Who said it? All right, what a voice. Have you ever tried opera? What a voice, did everybody hear that? That's true. I wouldn't say it. She said, “He has no idea where he is.” But I would never say it. I won’t say it. I won't say it. I refuse this. No, but don’t underestimate him. Look, he’s been doing this for 47 years, and I got a debate coming up with this guy. No, it’s true. You never know, you never know. They give him a big fat shot in the ass, and he comes out, and for two hours, he’s better than ever before. Problem is what happens after the … No, we’re going to ask for a drug test, we are. I’d like to have a drug test. Both of us. I’ll take it, he’ll take. Because I watched him into debates with all those people, those Democrats. The one who treated him worst was Kamala. Actually, also, she was the one that treated, you know that, she was the one that treated him so badly. And she treated Kavanaugh very badly too. Nobody was ever ruder, nobody ever suffered, like Justice Kavanaugh suffered in the hands and the mouths of those horrible people. The way he was tortured was disgraced. And they had nothing. Those women, that was all made up. Most of them have already admitted, it was all made up lies, false accusations, and they made him suffer. And the leader of the pack I would say was, Kamala was the worst, and Pocahontas was a close second. How’s Pocahontas doing, since she destroyed Bloomberg? How about Bloomberg? Did he get killed? Now he’s trying to come back. He’s trying to buy his way back into the Democratic Party. “I’m going to put up $100 million in Florida, we’re going to go,” he wants to be back so badly. Here’s a guy who spent $2 billion, it’s almost two billion now, they’re finding out. He had some of the dumbest advisers, people I know, some of the dumbest people. If he would have just kept spending a couple of hundred million dollars a week on ads, he could have won. He could have won. Unfortunately, he said, “No, I want to debate.” He went and sued to get into the debates. That was not a good lawsuit. They settled by saying, “We’ll let you in the debate.” The first question, he was destroyed. You would think that, the way the Democrats treated him, he would really come to me, and he’d say, “I want you,” but his hatred and jealousy … He wanted to be President, but he doesn’t have the capability of being President. But he’s going down now to Florida, he’s going to spend $100 million. How good … I have to say this, I’m not a fan of Elizabeth Warren. I gave her the name Pocahontas, I thought that was the end. Remember what I used to say about her? She has … Oh, well, you know it. You know. I would just, look, I said, “This is not an Indian.” She said, “I’m an Indian.” You remember what I said? “I have more Indian blood than me, I have more in me than she has, and I have none.” Unfortunately, I’d like to have some. I would like to have some. I think it could help, it might make me better, but I have none. And I said, “I have more than she does.” And then she went out to, and she choked, remember that? She went out, and she took a test. And it found out that about 700 years ago, there was a possible event, 1,024th, right? Wasn’t that it? Good memory, very good memory. Trump has a good memory. Good moment. Not for that, but for a lot of things. Now, 1024th, which meant many, many, many centuries ago, there could have been a hookup somewhere along the line. But she choked. We forced her into a choke. She went down like a rock, and then she started coming up, up, up, up, up. Then she totally destroyed Mike Bloomberg. We call him Mini Mike. Remember? Mini Mikey wants that platform. “I want a platform, damn it.” I don’t mind. Oh, boy, he was pathetic, but now he’s going to try and buy his way back into the Democrat party. Who was the other guy, the other rich guy? He just kept spending money. What was his name? You remember that guy? Great environmentalist. Except he made his money with coal, which is okay, I think coal is good. Clean coal, I like clean coal. If we had listened to Joe Biden, hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died. You know that. He was way behind. This was months later. And then I watch him last night, reading something saying that, I opened, I closed it up, one week later, one week. Two months later, he was talking about the fact that I shouldn’t be doing that to China. I shouldn’t be banning China because I was xenophobic. And it’s just unbelievable. And now they will say anything. It’s called disinformation. They will make up a lie, they will make up a story, and they go with it, it makes no difference whether or not it’s show, and they’ll take ads. It’s the worst group of people. He’s surrounded by bad people, dishonest people, but they’re very smart. He’s not smart. They keep him from talking. It’s actually, if he wins, it’s the single most brilliant campaign in the history of the world. Because they took a man who’s got nothing. He didn’t have it, but he’s got nothing, and I will give them credit. The single greatest campaign in history, if he wins, but you know what? If he wins, North Carolina is screwed, and so is every place else. And you can forget your tobacco industry, you can forget your farmers. I gave the farmers $28 billion. Thank you very much, Presidency. $28 billion. Because you were targeted, right? You were targeted by China. And I said, “How much were the farmers,” Iowa, Nebraska, you, all of them? You were targeted. I said, “How much?” Sonny Perdue, I said, “How much, Secretary?” 12 billion, then 16 billion, you were targeted. I took it out of the tariffs we charge. We never took 25 cents in from China, now we’re getting billions and billions and billions of dollars. And I took just a small part of it. $28 billion. That’s a lot of money, but it was a small part of what we’ve got. They can’t believe it. So who do you think China would like to see win? Sleepy Joe, that never gave, never took anything, or Trump, misjudging him? So Mexico, we’re driving them a little crazy. They don’t like Trump too much. But now Biden is recklessly campaigning against his vaccine. His campaign campaign’s really reckless. And all it is is for political reasons. It’s political reasons. Biden, his whole deal is catastrophic shutdown. We’re getting better, we’re really coming along, and he’s talking about shutting down. We’re not doing any shutdowns. We don’t need shutdowns. Maybe a little area, if it’s such a spike, we understand, we have to take care of our senior citizens. This guy talked, he said, “Well, I’ll do whatever my medical people want. I believe in science.” He doesn’t know what science is. “I believe in science.” No, we’re not doing any shutdowns. We don’t need, we’re rounding the turn. Without the vaccine, we’re rounding the turn. With the vaccine, it’ll just speed it up. That’s another one that will be controversial. They’ll say, “He’s saying that it’s happened.” Yeah, without the care, without the vaccine, it’s going along. With a vaccine, even better. It’ll be faster. Biden’s own chief of staff said, when they manage the H1N1 that he calls the N1H1, right? He goes, “the N1H1,” and that’s an easy one, because H comes before, but he always gets it wrong. It’s like, seven times, “It’s great to be with the great people of Iowa.” They’ll say, “Sir, you’re in Idaho.” “Oh.” I’ve never made that mistake so far. But I always say, “If you do, just leave the stage, because you can never recover.” You can speak as well as, I mentioned, Winston Churchill, even though he was a great speaker, he was a stutterer, and he became one of the greatest speakers ever. You could be Winston Churchill, if you make that mistake, just leave the stage. You can’t recover. But he’s made it oftentimes, right, in New Hampshire, and it was Vermont. The worst, I think, I think there was one, he was in Ohio, and he said he was in Florida, right? But he couldn’t find any palm trees. We just got a poll from Ohio. Through the roof. Great state of Ohio, good Governor, great state of Ohio. But when they managed the H1N1 swine flu, this was from his top person that ran it. “We did every possible thing wrong. 60 million Americans got H1N1 in that period of time. And it was just a total disaster.” He basically said, “We didn’t know what the hell we were doing.” And this is the guy that’s going to tell us what to do with something that’s much more lethal, much more lethal. This is much more lethal than the swine flu. If H1N1 had the same fatality rate as the China virus, over two million people would have already perished. They didn’t know what the hell they were doing. And the guy admitted it. That guy can not be very popular in Democrat politics right there. But just to remember, and he’s telling us how to do things. We’re building ventilators, we’re the ventilator capital of the world now, think of it. We’re sending them to other countries, we have so many. And we have made a lot of Governors look very good. And they all admit it, until the press comes in front, where they say, “Oh, he was okay,” but we took care of them. We took care of Governors, we took care of the states. On November 3rd, North Carolina will decide whether we will quickly return to record prosperity, or whether we allow Joe Biden to impose a $4 trillion tax hike, ban American energy, confiscate your guns. These are all things that he said. Shut down our economy, destroy the suburbs. They were saying that women in the suburbs, they’re not sure if they like me. They’re starting to like me a lot lately, because it’s law and order. They want law and order. Thank you. A suburbanite, thank you, thank you. No, it’s true. I don’t know. But I heard the same thing four years ago, remember? ” Women will not vote for him.” Then we win the election, it’s like, they’re all in shock. Well, what took place? “Well, he did very well with women,” what the hell was that all about, right? Did very well. Women were great. Hey, we were way above everything. African American, we did great, Hispanic, we did great. Have you seen African American and Hispanic American numbers? If it holds true, we will have set a record for a Republican, which is-Now, if it holds true … There a lot of jobs, a lot of jobs, a lot of great thinking, but he wants to give free healthcare to illegal aliens. Now, what that’s going to do is destroy our country, because two things happen. Number one, we can’t afford it. Number two, everybody is going to come pouring into our country if you do that. Right now, they’re saying, wherever they are, when you say, “We’re going to give you free education, we’re going to give you free healthcare. We’re going to take care of you. Everything’s going to be perfect. We’re going to give you, every single family,” now watch, they’ll print this. “We’ve checked it out, and he lied about this.” Every single family is going to be given a brand new Silver Cloud Rolls Royce. Now, I said that, and CNN went, “He lied about the fact that they’re not getting a Rolls Royce.” Remember what I said? ” Russia, if you’re listening,” in front of this message, “Russia, if you’re listening, find out where her e-mails,” or whatever. And then, everybody laughed, I laughed. Well, they actually play it all the time. “When he spoke to Russia.” Do you ever see it? And they cut it off before the end, they don’t see any, I said, “Russia, if you’re listening …” Oh, these people are sick. He wants to erase your borders. Yeah, that was supposed to be a joke, right? It was a joke. It was a joke, everybody was laughing, but they refused to go that extra quarter of a second. He wants to indoctrinate your children with poisonous anti-American lies in education. To combat the toxic left wing propaganda in our schools, I am launching a new pro-American lesson plan for students called, 1776 Commission. It’s already done. That's good. And it’s true, your kids come home, and they tell you things. How many of you, the kids come home, and they tell you things. It’s a disgrace, what they’re teaching them, it’s a disgrace. We’re ending it. In fact, we’re taking school funds away from these crazy schools that are teaching horrible things, bad things, actually. We will teach our children the truth about America, that we are the most exceptional nation on the face of the earth. And we are getting better every single day. And no party can lead America, that will not teach our children to love America. No party can do that. The sleepy campaign has joined forces with those trying to tear down America and our way of life. We have a great way of life, and getting better all the time. Look at what we’ve done. Biden’s running mate urged supporters to help bail rioters out of jail, including one who attempted murder. That’s right. One who attempted to murder a police officer, and a man accused of sexually assaulting an eight-year-old girl, 13 members of Biden’s staff donated to the same fund. Look, that’s where they’re coming from, just so you know. He’s trying to go a little bit more right, like the fracking. “Oh, well of course, we’re going to have …” For six months, he’s saying, there’ll be no fracking, which I don’t think the people in Pennsylvania thrilled with, do you agree, considering that your taxes could quadruple. I tell it all the time, Texas, right? Texas, they like oil. They like guns, right, in Texas. Right? And they like God. So he comes out with a platform, no oil. We don’t want oil. This is during the Democrat deal. There’ll be no oil, there’ll be no God, there’ll be no guns. This is not a good campaign. And then the fake news says, “Donald Trump is tied in Texas.” I’m tied. Last time I was tied in Texas until the day of the vote. Then they announced, the second they called it, “The polls in Texas have closed. Donald Trump has won the state of Texas.” Think of it. He’s against oil. He’s against guns. They’re going to confiscate your guns, Second Amendment’s going to be destroyed. I am holding up your Second Amendment. If it’s not me, look what I’ve done. You think it’s been easy? They want to get rid of the Second Amendment. They’re going to get rid of the guns, right? And religion. So, look what they’re doing to religion. These states, everything’s closed, except, you’re allowed to protest. That’s why I say everything we do is a protest. Look at all those people back there, look at that. Look it, they just form. Wow. Turn the cameras around, please. They never do it. Turn the cameras around, please. Wow. Thank you. That’s a lot of people. We’re proud of you. That’s a lot of people. You ever notice, they never do it, though. I say, “Turn the camera.” Right from the beginning, they never did. They don’t want to give us the credit for these big crowds, because you know what? When you see crowds like this, or in Wisconsin, that I had a few nights ago, or last night was so incredible. What we had last night was just incredible, in Minnesota. We’re going to win it, 1972, we’re going to win it. 1972, it hasn’t … That’s a long time ago. Remember? I think Reagan won every state except for Minnesota. We’re going to win Minnesota. What we’ve done for them, we’ve opened up their livelihood again. Maine. How about Maine? I opened up 5,000 square miles of ocean. Obama closed it. They said, “Why? He had no idea.” Right off their shore, no fishing, no nothing. They called it a monument, right? Right off their shore. Maine, I mean, if I don’t win Maine … Maine traditionally is not really very Republican, but I won Maine too last time, actually. Because I love Maine, too. I love Maine, too. But think of what I did. I opened the waters up for fishermen and for lobster men and women. Now they go lobster fishing and fishing. But 5, 000, I said, “Why did they close it?” Nobody was able to tell me, but I opened it up, an executive order. I totally opened it up. I did many other things. Then I got the tariffs. They couldn’t do business in European Union, they couldn’t do business in China, because they were charging tariffs to Maine. So Canada would take our fish and lobster. We’d sell it to Canada for nothing, and they’d sell it to China and Europe, because they didn’t have to pay tariffs. Not only did I get the 5,000 … Think of what, 5,000 square miles. So you take one mile, square mile, multiply times 5,000. That’s a big area, even in an ocean, right? It’s massive. And it was the best area, the best. I got rid of the tariffs. I told them, “If you tariff our Maine lobster people, and fishermen and women, if you want a tariff on them, that’s okay, but we’re going to tariff your cars, okay?” Which is a much bigger deal. It was amazing how quickly those tariffs were taken off. I did that off of Maine, I did that in two weeks, okay? Took me two weeks. Once I found out about it, it’s hard to believe it ever happened. So I did that for Maine. And somebody said, I’m down in Maine. How the hell can I be down in Maine, after what I did? I’ll tell you what if I do that from Maine, and if Maine doesn’t vote for Trump. I don’t think I’m going back, okay? I can tell you one thing. Their Senator never did it for them. Joe Biden and the Democrats want to gut police departments nationwide. You know that, right? Here in North Carolina, nearly 50 Democrat State House members and candidates have signed a pledge to slash police funding, endangering your families. I was recently honored to be endorsed by 54 sheriffs throughout this state, and we’re joined by many of them tonight. Where are they? Thank you, Sheriff. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, folks. Thank you. Thank you. You got to take care of our law enforcement. We got to take care, nobody can do the job like them. We have to let them do their job. We’ve got to stop this nonsense, this child’s play, we’ve got to stop, they’re great. You know, I was endorsed by, think of this, New York’s finest. It’s very tough. You know, de Blasio’s your mayor, he doesn’t have a clue what’s happening, either. I think Sleepy Joe’s worse, do you want to know the truth? Because this other guy has just an ideology that’s just terrible. But de Blasio is there, and New York’s finest, first time they’ve ever endorsed a Presidential candidate, they endorsed me, three weeks ago. That takes courage. Think of it. Chicago, the police in Chicago, they could do their job. We don’t even have to bring in the National Guard. Whenever we do, it takes about 30 minutes, it’s over, right? Like we did in Minneapolis, 30 minutes. Remember that beautiful scene? They lined up, they went down, there was no social distancing in between these great, tough guys. There was no social distancing, Tom Tillis. They went down and they had $250,000 outfits. They had more crap on that helmet with night goggles. And these guys were sort of wise guys, right? They were shouting at them, screaming at them. They were screaming at the wrong people. They went down, they never had to stop. It was just forward. It all ended. It all ended in Minneapolis. It took, you also had, what? A half an hour? Remember, they hit the CNN reporter in the knee? He went down, Ali Velshi. He said, “This is a friendly protest. It’s wonderful to see such a …” Behind him, it was all fire for a block. It looked like Berlin during the war. “This is a friendly …” What are they doing? How does that help to be like that? How does that help? We’re joined tonight by some really great friends of mine and some warriors that have been a fantastic help to me. One man who, especially over the last year, he has been so great, he couldn’t be better. And I think he’s doing very well. I’m looking at some numbers, and you’re doing very well. And I think your opponent has some very big problems. Senator Tom Tillis. Thank you, Tom. Thank you. He’s been great, smart guy. And he’s got a couple of bills that he’s putting in, one in particular, I love it. You got to do it. That if a sanctuary city causes problems, you can sue the sanctuary city, you can sue. Will you get, we got to get that one moving, right? That’s moving along, right? That’s a great one. A man who, I just did a phone call for the other night, and the people love him. He’s in a rough district, but he’s now leading. I see you’re up in the polls, Congressman Richard Hudson, great guy. Where’s Richard? Great guy. He’s a warrior. And two people I really liked, because we fought like hell for them a year ago, right? And they had guts, and they had what it takes. They didn’t choke. You know, a lot of people choke. They choke, they gag, they can’t breathe. Greg Murphy and Dan Bishop, they didn’t choke, they’re fantastic. They are fantastic people. Thank you. Look, they’re friends. We’re friends. Those two guys were incredible. Thank you very much, great job. Really great job. And a man that should be your Governor, I don’t know, he’s doing well, but Lieutenant Governor, Dan Forest, everybody. Thank you very much, great job. Handsome guy, handsome. Looks like Cary Grant. I hear you’re doing really well. Look, I mean, this guy’s got this state totally closed down. It’s ridiculous. It’s, when are they going to open? When are they going to open? Dan, this would have been opened up a long time ago. And you would have done even better. I mean, you would have done better. And North Carolina Republican Party Chair, Michael Whatley. Michael? Thank you, Michael. Great job, Michael. How are we doing, Michael? How’s it going? Are we up? I mean, if I lose North Carolina, I’m getting out of here. This is not … Look at that. This is not, just so you know, the crowd of a man that’s coming in second. I say it all the time. I said it when I left Michigan. 2016, the night of the election, we had 32,000 people. Hillary was there, just before me, in a prime location. She had about 400 people. I got there at 12 in the evening, I started speaking at one in the morning, it’s now Election Day, and I left. 32,000 people, we had 32,000 people. So it’s now Election Day. I start speaking, I started speaking, think of it, one o’clock in the morning, we had 30, you never saw anything like it. I left. I said, “That doesn’t look like we’re going to lose Michigan.” And guess what? We didn’t. We won Michigan, first time in decades. And you know what we’ve done? Many, many car plants are now opening up. A great gentleman, who’s just retiring, Prime Minister Abe, of Japan. I said, “Shinzo, please do me a favor. We need more car companies. You’re selling cars into our country, please. We want to build here, not in Japan, please.” He said, “But we cannot do that. This is a free enterprise system.” I said, “I know, Shinzo, please. I need some car companies. Please do it.” “I can’t do it.” I said, “Shinzo, you have to do it.” Next day, it was a story, “Five car companies to open up in Michigan,” right? So much for free enterprise, but he’s a great guy, he’s a friend of mine. He’s great. They’re lucky he’s a friend of mine. I would have been much tougher. It’s hard. When a guy is a friend, it’s hard, but they did a lot. They did a lot. They helped it a lot. And what they’ve done here, by the way, Japan, and what they’ve done in Michigan, Ohio, what they’ve done? By the way, we all love South Carolina, right, right? I think we love it. Now, South Carolina, we’re winning here, but South Carolina, I hate to say this to you, I don’t want to make you upset. We’re winning by about 400 points. I spoke to a great person in South Carolina who said, “Sir, you don’t have to come here. This thing’s up by a lot.” What the hell is the difference, right? I mean, we are up, and we’re up good, but I’d love you to tie South Carolina. What do we have to do? But a lot of activity in South Carolina also, they’re doing great. You had the best year you’ve ever had. They’ve had the best year they ever had. And you’re going to go to a better year, we are going to have a better year. We’re also deeply honored to be joined by a military spouse, Amy Williams, who was reunited with her husband, Sergeant First Class Townsend Williams, at my State of the Union address. Everybody remembers that. Everybody remembers. Look at that. Hi, Amy. What a great friendship. We had a great State of the Union, right? [inaudible 01:33:07] was there. Good, you’re looking well. Thank you very much. Say hello to the whole family. Thank you. Thanks to the incredible sacrifices of our warriors, and they are warriors. We’re pursuing peace in Afghanistan, it’s very close. We’re down to, we will soon be down to 4,000 soldiers. We’re taking them out. They’re serving as policemen. They’re serving as police, and they’ve done a great job. We could win everything, but I’m not looking to kill three million people to win, what? To win what? We should have never been in the Middle East, and we’re bringing them back. We’re bringing them back, just so you know, we’re bringing them back from Iraq. We’re down to 2,000 soldiers in Iraq. And in Syria, we’re all back, we’re all finished, except for one thing. If it’s okay with you. I decided to keep the oil. We took the oil, we kept it. And we’ll always support America’s incredible military families. So thank you very much. Thank you, darling. Really good. Okay. In everything we do, we’re putting America first, unlike other administrations, and not just Obama and Biden. This has gone on for many years. We put America first, and that’s what we’re doing. And you know what? Other countries, for the first time in decades, respect us again. Remember that. They respect us again. You know all about data, 28 countries. We had six countries that were current, and the amount of current is too low, okay? Six countries. I went in, and I said, “You got to pay. Sorry, you’re delinquent.” They said, “Really?” “Yeah,” I said. “You’re delinquent. You got to pay.” Obama would go, and make a speech and leave, that would be it. We were paying for it. We’re protecting Europe, and they’re screwing us on trade. So we protect them, and they’re screwing us on trade. No good, no good. Can’t do it. I said, “It’s unfair.” And the Secretary General, Stoltenberg, of NATO, said, “I’ve never seen,” and the fake news can call him up and check. He said, “He’s the greatest that we’ve ever seen.” For 20 years, the spending at NATO went like this, right? And America, we pick it up. Every time it goes down, they didn’t pay. And I said, “We’re supposed to protect you. You’re going to be attacked by Russia or somebody, we’re supposed to protect you. And yet you’re delinquent. You don’t pay your bills.” And that includes Germany. They’re paying 1%, they’re supposed to pay two, and 2% is way too low. 2% military spending. So we got, listen to this. It never gets reported by these fakers. We got $130 million more, more, not total, more, going to, over three years, $400 billion. So we’re going from 130 billion, with a B, not million, to $400 billion. And they said to me, they said to me, very nice guy, head of one of the countries, at a table. I can’t believe it never got released, but now we can talk about it, because it’s three years ago. But they said, “Sir … ” And this was a big private meeting of all of the nations, “Does that mean if we don’t … ” Because I said, “You got to pay your bills. We’re protecting you. You’re not paying your bills.” Some did, like Poland and some others, but most didn’t. Six to eight were current, and we were paying much more than we should have been paying, much more. I mean, it’s Europe. We got to defend ourself, and there was no guarantee that they’d help us if we ever had a problem. Right? We’re never going to have a problem. We got so much stuff now. We were depleted. Now we have great … But they said to me, “Does this mean … ” And I had to give this answer. I can’t believe it didn’t get leaked by some sleazebag. We have leakers all over this place, but a lot of it didn’t leak. A lot of it is just made up by the newspapers. They make up phony stories. They say, “Donald Trump woke up today. He was in a very bad mood, according to sources.” There is no source. They just made it up. Hey, I woke up, and I was in a bad mood. True. I’ve actually had a … I’ve been in a good mood, because we’re doing so much for our country. We’ve done so much for our country. But at the NATO meeting, one of the presidents of one of the good countries, all good, they said, “Sir, does this mean that if we don’t pay, does this mean that you’re going to leave, and you’re not going to protect us?” I said, “Yes. That’s what it means. I’m sorry.” It was an amazing effect, because other presidents said, “No. We will always protect you. We will always protect you, even if you don’t pay, even if our taxpayer is paying for everything, even though you take advantage of us on trade, you don’t let our cars in, you don’t let our stuff in, but you sell us like crazy, even though you tariff our product, even though you do everything, and then you take advantage of us with the military.” They said, “We will always protect you.” So they didn’t pay. Why the hell would they pay? They said, “Boy, these guys are stupid.” So they asked me the question, “Does this mean, sir, that you will not protect us anymore if we don’t pay?” I said, “I’m sorry to say, it does.” That’s a big story. Three years ago, it’s a big story. It was amazing how the money came in. So we took in 130 billion a year, going over a three-year period, to 400, just because I asked. Right? Just because I asked. True. They don’t report that story. Then we got lightweights that I fired, and they write books about me, that I’m a bad guy, “Oh, he’s a terrible guy. He treats our allies so badly.” No. Our allies treat us badly. Our allies in many ways treat us worse than our enemies. I must be honest with you. They take advantage of us. Everyone takes advantage of your country, and we don’t put up with it. And you know what the funny thing? We get along better now, because they respect us again. Before, they thought we were stupid. They respect us again. They do. I mean, look at Israel, look what we did. I saw Kerry this other day. Is this guy the worst negotiator? Gave Iran 150 billion, plus 1.8 billion in cash. He never walked. Sometimes in a negotiation, when you’ve given everything, and you can’t give anymore, and then they want more, you get up ane walk. Remember the bicycle accident? That was the only time he had to ride his bicycle in a race. 73 years old. “I promise,” I said, “I will never ever … I promise to you, ride a bicycle in a race, or any other time frankly.” I will never ride a bicycle during a negotiation. And he broke his leg, and his arm, and he was all screwed up. And that was actually a good thing, because it delayed the signing of that horrible deal, which I terminated. Nah, we had some terrible negotiators, and they all said, I saw them the other day, this was him like a year ago, “Mark my words, you will never ever sign deals with Arab countries, with Israel. It can’t be done.” Well, we just signed the two great ones, and we got about seven more that want to come in. What a bunch, what a bunch. And then they say bad things about your president. They don’t like my foreign policy. I like my foreign policy. You like it. No, we were taken advantage of by the whole world. They’re so stupid, so stupid. We’ve spent the last four years reversing the damage that Biden and his crew inflicted on us over a 47-year period. Joe Biden is weak. He’s supported every globalist sellout of North Carolina, the workers, what he’s done. And when I say, “him”, it’s him and people in his little group that … You’ve achieved so much over a period of time. He sold it out. Look at NAFTA. How bad was NAFTA? China’s entry into the World Trade Organization. TPP would have destroyed our car industry. And of course, he joined and wanted to join the Paris Climate Accord. That’s another beauty. That would have cost you trillions and trillions of dollars. That was actually, I think, designed to put us out of business, literally. Biden has repeatedly surrendered your jobs to China and other countries. This state lost 43% of all manufacturing jobs after the NAFTA and China disasters. You know that. You lost 43%, but I think the real number is 61%, by the way. Biden says that this an election between Scranton and Park Avenue. By the way, he left Scranton. He likes to say, “I was born in Pennsylvania.” But he doesn’t say he left. His father left. Not his fault, but they make it like he’s … No, he went to Delaware. He doesn’t leave Delaware, that I can tell you. Every time I see this guy … Wilmington, Delaware. Does he ever leave? I’m in Los Angeles. I’m trying to work on the fires. They ought to do some forest management a little bit maybe. Ridiculous. The floors of the forest, it’s got 20 years of leaves and trees that are dry as a bone, matchsticks. Forest management. Naturally, this is an election, not between Scranton or wherever it is. It’s really between Scranton and China, you know that, Scranton and China. I’m with America. Biden is with China. If Biden wins, China wins. If we win, America wins, North Carolina wins, Pennsylvania wins, and the American workers win in every single state. To save our auto industry, I withdrew from this horrible, horrible deal, Trans-Pacific Partnership. Earlier this year, I kept my promise to North Carolina when I ended the NAFTA nightmare. You got hit so hard. All those empty buildings all over the place, but a lot of them now are filled up because of us. They filled up. When did they fill up? Over the last three-and-a-half years. I proudly signed a brand new US-Mexico-Canada agreement into law, which will bring hundreds of thousands of high paying jobs back to the United States, and it’s already doing. We invested $2.5 trillion in the US military. Defense spending in North Carolina has soared by more than $1 billion a year. Congratulations, good job. We launched the first new branch of the US Armed Forces. This by itself would be a big achievement. This is one of so many different things, Right to Try, the military, the vets, everything. We’ve done so much, but we … 75 years, right? Last one was the Air Force. The Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Marines, the Coast Guard, they’re so good. We have another one now, for 75 years, Space Force. We need it. I never even promised that. Right? One of them said recently that, “He’s actually done more than he promised in the campaign.” That means I’m probably the only politician in history. They will tell you, these incredible women up here from North Carolina. Stand up. Will you, please? These are most incredible people. Thank you. Stand up. Turn around for the cameras, so they can see how incredible you are. Thank you. Man, oh, man. What a life. But we took care of the VA with Veterans Choice. You saw that. What Obama was nothing. It wasn’t working, the MISSION Act. That’s amazing. And accountability, where we can fire people in the VA that aren’t taking great care of our vets, okay? “You’re fired. Get out. You’re fired. Out.” We killed the founder and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdad. We took out the worlds number-one terrorist and the mass murder of American troops and many others, Qasem Soleimani. He’s dead. He’s dead. I withdrew from last administration’s disastrous Iran nuclear deal. I kept my promise, recognized the true capitol of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. And we got it built. I was signing a sheet of paper, you’ve heard this story, $1.1 billion. I said, “What’s this for?” They said, “Sir, now that you’ve moved, we’re going to build an embassy in Israel, in Jerusalem.” I say, “How much is it?” “1.1 billion.” You got some friends of mine here, they’re builders. You don’t spend 1.1 billion on a one-story building. I don’t know what’s going on. So I said, “So, does it have to cost so much?” “Yes, sir. We’re buying land” So I called David Friedman. He’s our ambassador, he’s one of the most successful lawyers in New York. He’s a brilliant guy. He loves Israel. Right? Love Israel. I call him. He’s the ambassador, he’s there. I said, “David, they want to spend 1.1 billion on a damn one-story embassy. It’s crazy.” I said, “Would you take a look? Maybe we own some land.” We own a lot of land. We’ve been there a long time. Calls me back. He said, “Let me take a look at it, sir.” He calls me the next day. “Sir, we have a great piece of land, a much better location that we were going to way overpay for, a much bigger piece. We have a setback building that we can renovate and make it great.” I said, “That’s fantastic, David. How much will it cost to renovate the building?” “I think we can do it for $190,000.” So I said, “David,” it’s the first time I’ve ever done it. I said, “David, it’s too cheap. You got to spend more than that.” So a friend of mine, Ron Baron, he’s got an office building, and he’s got Jerusalem stone facing the elevators in this high-rise building, Jerusalem stone. And every time I go in, he goes, “Oh, you got to see Jerusalem stone.” And he paid a fortune for it. He’s so proud of it. He doesn’t talk about anything but his Jerusalem stone. I said, “David, do me a favor. You’re I Jerusalem. Right?” “Yes.” “Do they have Jerusalem stone?” “They got so much, we don’t know what to do with it.” I said, “Use all Jerusalem stone when you’re rebuilding the building, when you do your renovation. Everything, wrap it in Jerusalem stone.” So I think we ended up spending, to fix up the building, like $500,000. Can you believe it? We were going to spend 1.1 billion, and by the way, it would never get built. It wouldn’t be built in 20 years from now. And they like it so much, they gave up the plan. They think this is better. It’s a better location, it’s probably a better building. But I could tell you stories like that all night long, the aircraft carriers that cost 10 times more than they should cost, and then they use the electric catapults. You’ve heard that. Right? They don’t want to use steam. Why? Because it’s too simple, because it works, because it’s better. So they go to electric catapults that they’re working on for years now. Elevators that are operated my magnets instead of hydraulic. Magnets. It sounds good. Trust me, it doesn’t work. One little glass of water. We’re in the ocean. One little glass of water, boom, those magnets are gone. I could have told them that. I actually asked the architect, ” Have you ever built a ship before?” It’s unbelievable. You heard the story last night about Air Force One. It saved a lot of money. I said to Boeing, “No. It’s got to have a three in front of it.” They were going to buy Air Force One, 5.7 billion. It’s a lot of money, but look, it’s a helluva a deal. It’s a helluva a plane. What can I tell you. I said, “How much is the new plane?” It was signed by Obama. “5.7 billion, sir.” I said, “That’s a lot of money.” It’s actually two planes. Air Force One is two planes. I’ll give you a little. They’re going to say, “That’s classified information.” Well, they’ve been flying around with two planes for 30 years, so I assume somebody knows. And our Air Force One is 31 years old. Right? So, look, it’s time. A lot of the Arab sheiks come in. I see their plane. They have a brand new one. I say, “What do we have?” 31 years, and we’re protecting them. Why the hell don’t we have a new one? So they finally had, at 31 years old. The new one is totally different, 747. It’s much longer, bigger wingspan, much more beautiful. It’s modern, it’s beautiful. 5.7 billion. So I said to the head of Boeing, nice guy, Dennis, this was before they had their difficulty, which is terrible what happened to them, but I said to him, “Dennis, I’m not going to spend $5.7 billion on a plane. I’m not going to do it. I won’t do it. It’s too much.” I said last night, I told this story, first time, I said, “It’s got to have a three on it.” He said, “We can’t do it. No.” He called me up the following day, “We’ll take 200 million off.” Somebody said, “Well, what are you losing?” I said, “Nothing. In fact, we’re gaining a generator.” And I said, “You got to build an extra generator.” He said, “We’ll take 200 million off.” I said, “Nope.” I said to the general in charge, I said, “General, can we break the deal?” “Yes, sir, we can. We have a cancellation clause.” “Good. General, execute your cancellation clause. We’re not going to buy it. I’m not going to pay $5.7 billion for Air Force One. I’m not doing it.” He said, “Yes, sir. I’m very proud of this clause.” “Why? Why?” “Because we have the right to cancel.” “Well, do we have to pay anything?” “Yes, sir, $250 million.” I said, “General, don’t cancel it. Take it back. Just tell them we don’t like the plane. Okay?” And I couldn’t even say, “I’m going to buy it from Europe.” The only competitor is Europe. I can’t say, “We’ll buy it from Europe.” No, that doesn’t work out to well. So I said, “Don’t do it. I don’t want to send them a check.” 250 million for nothing. Right? We don’t want to do it. So I said, “Just tell them, “We don’t like it. The price is too high. We’re not going to buy it.” But don’t send anything, don’t put it in writing. Please, general.” “Yes, sir.” “Thank you.” So about a week later, the head of Boeing called me up. He said, “Look, we can get it down, but you’re asking for too much.” I said, “You don’t understand. It has to have a three on it, not a four, but three.” So another months goes by. I forgot about it. I get a call from Boeing, “Would 3.9 billion be okay?” I said, “Yes, that’s okay. It’s got a three on it.” True. True story. True story, and then somebody said … it’s true though, somebody said, “Well, it must be a different plane.” Yeah. I said, “Yeah, we have a much nicer paint job.” We have a much nicer paint job, you know that, and it actually got an extra generator put on. Okay? So it’s actually more. They said, “well, we could use an extra generator.” I said, “Is there anything else you need?” They said, “Sir, we could use an extra generator.” I said, “We’ll get it for you, we’ll get it.” So I had it included in the price. These people know exactly what I’m talking about. It’s called included in the price. But think of it, there’s hundreds of deals like that. But you’re one person, and that’s why I got Mark Meadows involved, because he’s from North Carolina. He’s from North Carolina, and he’s cheap as hell. I need some cheap people. Oh, there’s many, hundreds and hundreds of stories. I could tell you so much. It’s crazy. The Biden agenda would collapse our economy and destroy your country. It would destroy your Social Security and protections for preexisting conditions, it will. He’s going to drain your Medicare by giving away our healthcare to illegal immigrants. And I will tell you this, you’re going to have socialized medicine. That’s as sure as you’re there. And Obama lied 28 times when he said you can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan. It was a lie. Said it 28 times, that we have, but it was a lie. But now you’re really losing your doctor. You’re going to have socialized medicine. Eliminate private healthcare insurance for 180 million Americans who love their healthcare. They have the best in the world. His running mate sponsored the socialist takeover of healthcare. You saw that. He wants to ban private insurance. You’re going to lose … 180 million people are going to lose their healthcare under this Biden character, and he has no clue. They’re going to take it away from him. They’re going to be running him ragged. “Sign this. Sign this.” “Okay. What is it?” “Doesn’t matter. Just sign it, President, right now.” “I’m getting tired. I’d like to rest, I’d like to let Kamala take over as president.” That’s no way to get into the office, because we’re going to have a woman president someday, but you know what? It can’t be Kamala. Kamala. Nobody treated him worse, and he picked her. I’ll tell you, I was … brilliant forecast. He could never pick her. She called him a racist. Right? She talked about Me Too-ing him. He was going to be Me Too-ed. Right? Me-Too-ed. A lot of bad things. There was nobody. Think of it, even Pocahontas treated him better. She knocked the hell out of Bloomberg, but she left him sort of alone. I think she felt sorry for him. I heard she felt sorry for him. I don’t want people to feel sorry for our president. I want other people, really, to feel sorry for themselves, because we have somebody that knows what they’re doing. We can’t have it. We can joke, we can play games, we can have fun. You can’t have this guy as your president. You can’t have him. Maybe I’ll sign an executive order. You cannot have him as your president. No, but you know this. Everybody knows this. And you know what? People are going to vote for him because they feel sorry for him. I feel sorry for him too. I feel sorry for him. And maybe he’ll show up for an hour-and-a-half at a debate. Who the hell knows? I don’t know. But you know. You see the condition he’s in. You can’t have him as your president. And you know what? You can’t have her as your vice president, potentially going to be president. And that’s why they’re pushing so hard, because they know he’s going to be out very soon, and she’s going to take over. And she is the furthest left person of anybody. She is rated, not by me, she is rated further left than even Bernie Sanders. Okay? He’s second, she’s first. And just in concluding, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing super power of the world, and we will end our reliance on China and other countries once and for all. We will make our medical supplies right here in the United States, and right here in the great state of North Carolina. By the way, get out and vote, please. Okay? We will hire more police. Thank you, sheriffs. Thank you, sheriffs. I love the sheriffs. We got the endorsement from all the sheriffs in Florida, everybody up in Ohio and Texas. We have the stuff, nobody’s ever seen anything like it, the endorsements from law enforcement. We’re going to increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement. We will ban deadly sanctuary cities. We will defeat everybody that we have to, including the virus, but we will defend the dignity of work, and we will defend the sanctity of life. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens, and we will keep … You know this, right? It’s okay, right? We will keep America out of these ridiculous foreign wars. We will maintain American’s unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. It’s about time. We will end surprise medical bills, require price transparency, and further reduce health insurance premiums and the cost of prescription drugs, which we’re doing an unbelievable job on, other than the fact that the drug companies are spending a fortune, because they don’t like me much. You will see drug prices, prescription drugs, dropping 50, 60, 70% in a very short period of time. Favored nations clauses. We will strongly protect Medicare and Social Security, and we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions. America will land the first woman on the moon, and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. You have to see what we’ve done with NASA. We’ll be the first one on Mars, I hope. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriot education to our schools, patriotic education. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, and we will never change it, by the way. We will never change it. They took the word, “God”, out of the Pledge of Allegiance twice. I said, “Did they make a mistake.” Did they make a mistake. They didn’t for them. They made a mistake for us. We’re not going to put up with it. But we will keep, “In God we trust.” For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of North Carolina. This is the most important election we’ve ever had. Remember it. We’re going to be a socialist country. We’re going to be a communist country. These people are further … they’re much further left than socialism. These people are sick. So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, and get out and vote. Get out and vote. And watch to make sure they’re not cheating, which they will be. Early voting has already begun. Don’t wait. Get out and vote. We got to win this. If we win this state, we’re going to win the whole thing. This is a very important state. If we win North Carolina, we’re going to win the whole thing, because we’re doing well everywhere, from Wilmington to Charlotte, from Concord to Raleigh, and from Greensboro to right here in Fayetteville. We inherit the legacy of generations of North Carolina patriots, who gave their blood, sweat and tears for this beloved nation. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes, who crossed the oceans, blazed a trail, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, raised up the skyscrapers, won two World Wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And you haven’t seen anything yet, haven’t seen Proud citizens like you, helped build this country. And together, we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, with your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. You hear that, General? We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together, with the incredible people of North Carolina, we will make America wealthy again, we will America strong again, we will make America proud again. We will America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you very much. Get out and vote, vote, vote, vote.

"65","09-21-20","Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the 45th president of the United States, Donald J. Trump. Wow, that's a big crowd. This is a big crowd. Thank you very much, everybody. Hello to Swanton and a load to Toledo. I’m thrilled to be back in Ohio with thousands of hardworking, loyal, great American patriots … days from now. Can you believe it, 43 days? We go to again win Ohio. I understand from Bob Paduchik, you know Bob? That we’re going to win it by more than we did. Whether we win at nine, we won by nine points. I just came into that big, beautiful place. It’s got more televisions in any plane in history. They’ve got televisions and closets and bathrooms on the floor, on the ceilings. I just saw that we’re tied in Ohio. I don’t think so … President Trump may have a slim lead in Ohio? They’re not even campaigning in Ohio, come to think of it. Now, they’re fake polls. They’re almost as fake as the writers themselves. They’re all fake. Remember last time they said, “No, he’s going to lose Ohio.” We won by nine points. So, we had seven swing states last time. President Trump is going to go home early, but it wasn’t president at that time, it was just Donald Trump. He will go home early. We did. That we went home early as victors, but we had nine states. They had one of the crazy papers, New York Times. They hired that guy. They paid him millions because he never predicted wrong. He was wrong. I don’t know if they had a contract where they could fire him, but they hired this guy. We had nine states. I was down at all of them on the day of election. I was going to lose all nine, and then guess what? I won every one of them. Fake polls. They’re fake polls. Then we have a crowd like this. I don’t know. Look, the cameras, are you turning around? These guys are bad people. I swear. They never turn the cameras around, ever. Turn them around. Turn them around. They never tell, look at them. It’s just like a bunch of stiffs. Real stiffs. Why don’t you turn the cameras around for once? You look back there, you can’t see it. There’s got to be, feels like Madison Square Garden on the ground except we have more people. Oh boy, it’s always tough. You know, we go through this all the time. We’re always asking them, look at these crowds. I mean, as far, you can’t see it. You have this prime territory, like you should be in the real estate business. Now, as far as the eye can see back there, the cameras don’t, they don’t get it. You only hear it from the sound. I go home. I say to the first lady, “Did you see that crowd we had tonight in Ohio?” She goes, “No, no. They just keep it on your face.” That includes Fox. They just keep it here, right here. They don’t want to show. You know what they don’t know and what they don’t get is that showing this kind of activity is a good thing for them. It’s positive for their ratings. It’s really a good thing, but they don’t want to do it, but I give up on it. You know what you do? You hear it because you can’t have … You know when sleepy Joe Biden, he’s got the circles. You knowthose big circles? You know why he has the circles? He’s got four of them, because they can’t … I mean, think of it. He is a guy who’s failed every time he ran. We called him 1% Joe and now he’s shot and he got their nomination. How the hell does that work out? How does that work out? But he’s got the circles. He got like four, sometimes he has six because that’s a good way of saying, if you don’t have any people, just put them in the circle and he’s practicing the science. Now it doesn’t work out, but we’re going to win four more years in the White House. We’re doing things that nobody’s ever done before. We’re doing what nobody’s ever done, and thank you for being here. I wish we could move the press back further, if you want to know the truth. As our nation mourns the loss of Supreme Court Justice … Thank you everybody. Thank you. So is our nation mourns the loss of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, I will soon announce a nominee for the United States Supreme Court. They say it’s the most important thing a president can do. I don’t know. I think military, maybe. We rebuilt your military two and a half trillion dollars. Great. We will fill that seat. It’s going to go quickly. Probably announced the person. I don’t want to make the men too angry. It will be a woman. Is that okay? I don’t want to have a problem with men. They’ll say Trump is doing very poorly with men. You listen. How’s he doing? Well, he’s doing very poorly with men, with women. He’s doing very poorly with the black community, Hispanic community. Then you have the election night doing very poorly with those with diploma, without diploma, college, PhDs. What’s he doing well? Oh no, it’s going to be a very short night. Then they say Donald Trump is the projected winner by a lot. They say, well, what happened is he did very well with women did very well with men, diplomas. He did well with African American community. By the way, we are doing really well with the African American community, with the Hispanic community. We’re doing well with women. We’re doing very well. We’re doing well with suburbia, suburbia. I ended a regulation that will destroy suburbia. If Biden got in, they will destroy the suburbia. We call it suburbia of the world and we love it. I know it well, Westchester County, the suburban, they sometimes, if you say suburban housewife, you’re in deep trouble. So what you do is you say suburban women, they love me. You know why? They want security and they don’t want projects being right next to their house. That’s okay. They don’t want it. By the way, that includes minorities. Because 29% to 30% of these suburban communities are minorities. That includes them. They don’t want that. They want safe communities. They want great communities. They don’t want to lose the American dream. It’s very simple. I got rid of the regulation from Obama- Biden that was destroying suburbia. Okay? Destroying it. I think suburbia has got to wake up because if they get in, you know who’s in charge? You know who’s in charge of the program? Cory Booker, Cory Booker. Cory Booker. So, I think the suburban women and suburban men and husbands and wives and everybody, you better get smart because you’re not going to have your dream very much longer if they get in. If I get in, you’ve got it. You’ve also got your second amendment if I get it. In 2018, we expanded the Senate majority. Remember, they said, first of all, I wasn’t running. I wasn’t running. It makes a difference. Wait you see what happens. We’re going to take back the house. We’re going to get rid of this crazy Nancy Pelosi. Kevin McCarthy’s done a great job. We’re going to take back the house. People are so tired of her. People are so tired. Did you hear today? The latest. So, they impeached me for perfect phone call. Perfect. It was a perfect phone call. Now they want to impeach me again if I nominate somebody as I’m constitutionally obligated to do, to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States. Go ahead and I want them to do that. I want them to do that. We will. We will. We will. If he puts forth a highly qualified candidate, we will impeach him. Well, I said, “Well, I’m the only guy in the world that could get impeached for trying to fill a seat in the Supreme.” So, we’re going to put up our nominee who’s going to be outstanding. We’re looking at five incredible jurists, five incredible people, women that are extraordinary in every way. I mean, honestly, it could be anyone. I mean, we’re going to be announcing it on Friday or Saturday. Again, they say it’s the most important thing and think of it. So in a single term, single term, by the end of our term, we will have nominated and had confirmed I think it’ll end up being over 300 federal judges and hopefully three Supreme Court justices. Think of that. Three. Some presidents, they never get any. They last a long time, a lot of presidents get none. We’ve had three. It’s blowing their minds. It’s blowing their minds, but for the people of Ohio, this is what you want. So, it looks like we’re going to have three and it’s going to be very exciting. It’s exciting even from me. I’m going to look forward to it. Probably Saturday, we will announce the nominee and it’s somebody that you’re going to have great respect for, great respect. Thank you. Big stuff. That’s a big thing. They set the course of our country for many years to come, whether it’s on life or the second amendment or so many other things, they set the whole course of the country. Very important position, the most important. Joe Biden has refused to list the names of his potential justices because he knows they’re too extreme to withstand any form of public review. If Joe Biden and the Democrats take power, they will pack the Supreme Court with far left radicals who will unilaterally transform American society far beyond recognition. They will mutilate the largest figure the constitution and oppose a socialist vision from the bench that could never pass at the ballot box. So, they don’t want to show the judges because the only ones that he can put in are far left radicals. If he does something even towards left of center, which would be acceptable, I guess, we have no choice. If he did that, he would lose the left. So, he’s going to have to put in radicals. So he doesn’t want to show who his judges are. I’ve shown a list, I have a double list, about 45 from which I will only pick, but he doesn’t want to do that, because if you found out who he was going to pick, he would be unelectable. Hopefully, he’s going to be unelectable anyway. We’re going to find out. So, he wouldn’t be able to survive a Joe Biden. You wouldn’t be able to survive. We’ve been calling it socialism. I don’t think it’s socialism. I think it’s a step beyond what they’re talking about. You look at Portland, you look at Chicago, you look at New York, you look at Baltimore and Oakland. These are Democrat run cities that are horrible in crime. There’s no law and order, no cash bail, no anything. You know what? The Republican cities are running great. They’re running great. So, we’re going to get it all changed around. We went into Minneapolis, we solved the problem like you wouldn’t believe. What did it take? You saw it. What did that take? I would say probably 30 minutes. Right? They should have called us in about seven days earlier. How about the reporter? He gets up there, behind him is a burning city. I never saw anything like it. He’s saying, “There are really no protests here. This is very friendly.” We call this a friendly protester because you’re not supposed to have political rallies. You’re not supposed to have anything. The only thing you can have is thousands of people running down a street burning stores, looting, doing what … That’s okay, because that’s protesting, but we’ll call this a friendly protest, but your children will be robbed of their future and the damage will endure for generations to come. We have to win. This is the most important election in the history of our country in my opinion. And a lot of that’s got to do with the fact that we’re going to have one extra, but we didn’t think this was going to happen. But I used to say just a week ago, “We’re going to have one, two, three, four, and maybe even five, the next President, and the Supreme Court is going to be a tremendous factor.” A lot of people said that’s the reason I won so easily in the Electoral College last time. 306, 306 to 223. “He will not get to 270.” Remember? “He will not get to 270. This will be a short evening for Donald Trump. Oh, good riddance. Thank God we got rid of him. Oh, this is going to be great.” And then that problem happened. “Ladies and gentlemen, Donald Trump has won the state of Ohio.” Remember the one, she was crying? She was crying. “Donald Trump has won Ohio.” But it wasn’t winning Ohio, it was by the margin. “Where the hell?” he said, “Where did this margin come from?” They opened the polls. Then they closed the polls. Normally you have to wait hours, unless it’s a total runaway. And they said, “Ah, the polls and the doors are closed in Ohio. Donald Trump has won.” And they go, “Oh my God. But wait a minute. He won by nine points. What the hell’s going on over here?” Then they said, “Donald Trump has won the state of Florida. Donald Trump has won the state of Georgia. Donald Trump has won North Carolina, South Carolina.” Remember that? Was that the most exciting evening, really? Remember? And it’s not Donald Trump. It’s you. It’s all of us. They use the name Donald Trump. It’s all of us have won. And this one’s going to be even better because nobody has done, and then don’t even challenge it, the fake news, nobody has done in three and a half years what we’ve done. We’ve rebuilt our military. Two and a half trillion dollars. We’ve taken care of our vets. We have choice, we have accountability. We can fire people now when they’re not treating our vets right. We couldn’t do that before. They could treat our vets terribly. We have accountability. Nobody has done what we’ve done for our vets. 91% approval rating at the VA. 91%, the highest ever. So nobody’s done it, and that’s why I think this is going to be the most important of all. I used to say, “Well, I don’t know. How does it compare to 2016?” I just gave that up. This is the most important election. You know why? Two reasons. Number one, that’s over with, the hell with it. The hell with it. But the truth is it’s got a seat in, and we have a lot of new things including additional, substantial, middle income tax cuts and other tax cuts, and tremendous regulation cuts. And we’re finishing up with our military. We’re building Space Force. The wall is going incredibly. You remember the wall? They don’t talk about the wall anymore, the fake news. Once we started building it, if you think that was easy to build the wall, we had an entire party that would die for the fact, and I made a terrible mistake in the wall, instead of telling you, “We’re going to build a wall, we’re going to build a wall,” the Democrats formed, it was very tough, but I got it. I’m a real estate developer. You can always get money. You learn we have a lot of little pockets. We had a lot of big pockets. But the military was great. The Army Corps of Engineers were great. So we’re up to 330 miles of wall. We’re doing 10 miles a week, and we’re going to be finished with the wall very soon. And it’s exactly the wall, the little more expensive wall, they want like nice, expensive, but exactly what border patrol wanted. We’re building them the exact wall that they want. We can’t give them any excuses. We can’t give them any excuses. But it’s true, they used to talk about the wall all the time because they never thought I’d be able to get a bill. Once I got it going, got it built, I got the financing, we won a lot of lawsuits, by the way, we won a lot of lawsuits. They sued us. Pelosi was suing us. Congress was suing us. The Senate was suing us. We won a lot of lawsuits. Once it was obvious that we won and we started building, they never talk about the wall anymore. And I made a terrible, terrible mistake because I had to work my ass off to get that thing built. You have no idea. You have no idea. You have no idea. But I should have said, the mistake, I should have said when I talked to these big crowds, and the crowds are getting bigger, there’s more enthusiasm now than we ever had four years ago, but I should have said, instead of, “We will build a wall,” I kept, “We will build a wall,” place would go crazy, I should have said, “We will not build the wall. Under no circumstances, will we build a wall,” the Democrats would have given us all the money we wanted. It’s true. It’s true. And then they would have said, “See, he didn’t keep his campaign promise.” These people are sick. The Biden nominated justices will shred our Second Amendment, eliminate the right to self defense, and allow the government to confiscate your privately owned firearms. You know that. Put in other language, they will end your Second Amendment. And they will do that. By the way, if I wasn’t here, you wouldn’t have a Second Amendment right now. That would be gone. I hate to say it. I’m the only thing standing between you and chaos, I’m telling you. And Second Amendment and all of the other things. Biden’s justices will remove the words “under God” from the Pledge of Allegiance. Did you see that? Did you see it? They said, “No, we’d never remove. And I saw it, they’re doing the Pledge of Allegiance. And I said, “Oh, it must be a typo.” They left the words “under God” out of the Pledge of Allegiance, the Democrats. And I said, “Oh, there’s a typo. Typo, they made a mistake. What a stupid mistake. Can you believe it? That guy’s in big trouble. What a stupid mistake.” And then I heard it a second time. They did the same mistake. That’s what they’re doing. They’re going to take God out of everything just like they want to knock down the statue of George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson. That’s never happening. It’s never happening. A lot of these Democrats states, you see it, the churches are closed. They don’t want our churches to open. You can have a riot where you kill people in the streets. 25,000 people don’t have to wear a mask, nothing. They can march down the streets, step on each other’s face, they can do whatever the hell they want, that’s okay. But you can’t go to church. They have ideas, they have plans, and it’s never happening with me as your President. That I can tell you. And you see it, they want to tear down crosses from public spaces. You see it. Since I signed a little law, they were ripping down a lot of statues about four months ago, and I said, “Do we have any laws, like old laws when they was strong, when we were smart, when we were tough?” “Sir, we have one, sir.” A General came in. “What’s the law, General?” “Sir, there was a law from quite a while ago, 10 years in prison.” They didn’t use the word jail, prison. Prison’s a tougher word. I said, “What do you mean, 10 years?” “You get 10 years in prison if you knock down a statue or if you knock down a monument.” I said, “General, let me see that sucker, please. Bring that to my office.” And we revived it because you can’t get that approved by Congress. They would never. Today in Congress, you’d do it, they’ll give you half a day in a hotel someplace. So 10 years. So they were having a big march on Washington in two days and I signed this new law. We updated it, and it was 10 years. You get 10 years in prison. You touch, you knock down a monument. And there’s no games. This is the old days. This is the days when we had strong laws, when we had real laws, when we had real politicians that knew how to make laws. So here’s the thing. So they weren’t going to come in, they were actually looking to knock down the statue of a man named Thomas Jefferson. That’s not too good. They had obliterated a lot of different things. And so I had a news conference. I announced that I’m signing a law that anybody that knocks down a monument or a statue gets 10 years in jail. And the police in Washington, and we had National Guard, we had Secret Service. We were all ready for them. We were ready for them. And the time came, there’s was only a problem, nobody showed up. You know why? 10 years was too much. 10 years was too much. It’s amazing the way. Isn’t it amazing the way it all works? So instead they burned down Portland. I speak to the Governor. The mayor is hopeless. He’s a hopeless, poor guy. They chased him out of his apartment, and he still thinks they’re wonderful people. They’re burning down his city. But I want to go in there with the National Guard so bad. It would take us 15 minutes to solve the problem. When they heard in Seattle that we were going in, we were going in the next day, the guys just walked away. They left. That was the end of it. We had nothing to do. But they want to ban all prayer in public schools and require taxpayers to fund extreme late term abortion. Biden’s justices will erase national borders, they don’t want borders, protect sanctuary cities, and compel the unlimited entry of foreign nationals. And if you look at some of these jihadist nations, no thank you. Somebody said, “That’s not nice. That’s not politically correct.” I said, “That’s okay.” They’ll clip all the police departments, free violent criminals, shield foreign terrorists, and declare the death penalty unconstitutional, even for the most depraved mass murderers who kill women and children. That’s what they want. They don’t want any death penalty. Not for the Boston Bomber, not for anybody. You see the Boston Bomber, they’re still trying this guy, what he did to so many lives. He killed people, ruined so many families, ruined so many lives. And by the way, they want the Boston Bomber to be able to vote. You know that. In three and a half years under my administration, we’ve secured America’s borders, rebuilt the awesome power of the United States military, obliterated the ISIS caliphate 100%, fixed our disastrous trade deals, and brought jobs and factories back to the great state of Ohio. I love Ohio. I love Ohio. I don’t know what it is. I was told by Bob and some of the Congressmen that are here, we have some great ones, I’m going to introduce them in a second, but I was told that they’re not even trying for Ohio. You know why? Because I love you and you love me, and that’s the way it is. That’s the way it is. Thank you. I love you too. It’s very interesting. So somebody in the fake news media did a story yesterday because there’s crazy chances going on. They have too about the seat and all that. But there was another chant that’s happening at all these rallies. We’re having massive rallies. We’re in Minnesota. We had a tremendous crowd. Wisconsin, tremendous. Pennsylvania, every one of them. I mean, in all fairness, it’s like this, everyone. But this rant is going on like it’s crazy. And it’s, “We love you. We love you. We love you,” and you know what? I don’t want to say it. I’m just saying, they have not been able to find in the history of politics in this nation, even we loved Ronald Reagan, but they have not been able to find where people broke out and said, “We love you,” about, I guess I have to call myself a politician. I don’t feel like a politician. How nice is that? I never heard it. I’ve been to a lot of different speeches and rallies. I’ve never heard crowds go, “We love you.” But you know why? We love you. I love you. But you know why? Because, again, nobody has done what we’ve done. Ohio had the best year in its history last year. We had a great year. And next year, assuming we win, which I hope we’re going to win, but if we win, you’re going to have a year next year. First of all, take a look at the third quarter. It’s going to be announced the numbers just before the election. They’ll come out three days before the election. And I’ll tell you what, I’ll bet on the numbers, even though Crazy Nancy and these people don’t want to give any stimulus, they don’t want to give anything. They want to keep a lot of states closed wherever they can. You know what they’re going to do? They’re going to announce they’re going to be opening on November 4th. There’ll be open. All these closed states, they’re going to be open on November 4th. One of them blue and a teacher’s union. Did you see it? “No, we don’t want to open now. We don’t want to open. The pandemic. We don’t want to.” We’re rounding the turn on the pandemic. Vaccines are coming soon. “But we don’t want to open. Around November 4th we’re going to open.” This person that’s a judge of a union said that. That was not good. I think they’ll get rid of her quickly. I’m also proud that we have successfully brought back the Big 10 and the Ohio State Buckeyes. You better have a good year after all of that. You have a good team, right? Good coach. Good team. Good everything. You have a good team. You always have a good team. But there was a case, what do I know? I said, “How’s it going? Everything good? Are you struggling?” They said, “Sir, Sleepy Joe Biden did an ad that you,” me, “that you closed football.” I said, “What do you mean I closed? I didn’t close.” The guy did an ad. It’s called disinformation. It’s called the opposite of what the fact is. Not only didn’t I close it, I didn’t think about it too much, okay? The states should all be open. But I heard about Big 10 football, and because of this ad, I said, “Hey, wait a minute. I have an idea.” It was a fake ad, just like the ad on the grave sites, and that allows me to say that this man is a gross incompetent. He has no idea. Because now, see, I would never talk like that, but when I saw that horrible thing, and nobody’s done more for the military than I have, when I saw that horrible ad, “An anonymous source has said that Donald Trump said this,” I have 28 people now that have come forward saying it’s a total lie, they don’t care, so they did an ad, once they did that, I said, “Well, now the gloves are off.” Let’s face it, Joe Biden is incompetent. He always was even in prime time. he was incompetent in prime time. And now he’s really incompetent. But because of the ad, I said, “It’s very interesting, that ad, it’s very interesting. Let me call up the Commissioner.” I had called up the Commissioner, very good guy, and I said, “Commissioner, what can we do to get Big 10 football back?” “Well, I don’t know.” And we started a little thing, the Commissioner and myself, one of my guys, he’s fantastic, and within a few days, it started getting talked about, and then we kept it going and we helped him with some testing because we have the greatest testing in the world. We get no credit for it. We’ve tested almost 100 million people. India is second with 38th and they have 1.5 billion people, slightly more than you. But I will tell you, so all of a sudden they have schools. Then looked like it was going to open without Michigan and without a couple of states. And then all of a sudden the pressure became so great, and the full league is opening now and it’s going to be very exciting. And I will tell you, it’s not a question of taking credit, but truly we were the ones that did that. I mean, it was. I’ll tell you when I do it and when I don’t. But it was closed, it was gone, it was announced that it was closed. And what really spurred me on was when Sleepy Joe announced that I was the one that did it. I said, “I didn’t even know it was closed.” But once I found out it was, I called the Commissioner. He was really good, I tell you. And we called a couple of the top people at the universities and they got it going. It looked like we had seven schools, eight schools. All of a sudden, everybody fell into line. I think they’re all open now. Every one of them is participating. So I want to thank the Commissioner. I want to thank all of those schools. May the best team win. In other words, Ohio State. That’s a good team. You know who the best proponents were? The players and especially the parents of the players. These kids have a short window to get into the NFL to create some excitement and how good they are. And you have a lot of potential players, but they couldn’t play football. And they said, “We’re safer on the field than we are staying at home,” and they meant it. And we did something and I’m happy about it. So enjoy the football, enjoy it. Under 16 years of Presidents Obama and Bush, median household income rose only $2,945. So remember that. That’s 16 years, 2009, so let’s say 3000. Under three years of President Trump, it rose almost $7,000. So think of that, 16 years. Three years, achieving the highest median income in the history of our country. In my first three years, we lifted 6.6 million people out of poverty, the largest poverty reduction of any President in the history of our country. We built the greatest economy in the history of the world and we are doing it again. We’re building it again. I see the signs “Make America Great Again,” so I say this, it’s called now “Make America Great Again. Again”. Because we did it and then we had to close it up. We saved millions of lives. If we didn’t do that, you would have had three million people. It would have been terrible. It’s terrible anyway. They shouldn’t have allowed it to happen, China. To defeat the China Virus, we launched the largest mobilization since World War Two. Through pioneering therapies, we reduced the fatality rate 85% since April. Think of that. That’s remdesivir and all of the things, the plasma, all different things. Where do you see what’s coming out? Europe is almost 30% greater excess mortality rate than the United States. That’s before today’s big breakout. You know they had a big breakout in Europe and they keep saying in the fake news, they keep saying about, “Oh, Europe, Europe, Europe.” Well, we’re doing better than Europe. I hate to see what happened, and it had a big impact on the market today because it was a bad thing. But they had a big hit and they’ll take care of it. They know how to do it. They’ll take care of it. We’re working very closely with Europe and other countries, including on the vaccine. We have three vaccines right now that are right there. They’re right at the starting gate and they’re going to be fantastic. So it’s good. With Biden, if you had that regime, you’d be three years away because it would have never gotten out of the FDA. What we’ve done in a very safe manner is amazing. Now remember this, Biden was in charge of the swine flu, right? It’s called the H1N1. Remember he calls it the N1H1. I said, “No, no, no, no.” H comes before the N. It’s so easy. But he goes, “The N1H1.” We say, “No.” But it’s the swine flu. Maybe we just call it the swine flu. He did such a gross, horrible job on that. His own man who was in charge of it said they didn’t have a clue. They didn’t know what they were doing. It was a much less lethal disease and they lost many, many people. Many, many people. It was totally incompetently. And now I got this guy standing up. Well, we’re giving him advice. His own guy that ran it. Did everybody see this? They’re saying they didn’t have a clue what they were doing. It was so bad. I don’t know why the hell he said it, to be honest with you. Who would say that? Maybe because he was honest. Does that make sense? Now Biden gets up and he’s saying to do the same things as we’ve already done. He basically took our plan and he said, “This is what you should do.” But we have among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country in the world and the fastest economic recovery by far of any Western nation by far. Our bold and early action saved millions of lives and our decisive economic response saved tens of millions of jobs, including 1.9 million jobs in the state of Ohio. You know that? He knows it. He’s got one of them. He’s got one of them. Through operation warp speed, we’re developing these great vaccines. And that’s going to be… Literally, these will be done in record time. Like nobody’s ever done it before. On November 3rd, Ohio will decide whether we end the pandemic and return to record prosperity or whether we allow sleepy Joe Biden and his group of incompetence to delay the vaccine, shut down the country. He actually suggested that he would shut down the country. We now know the disease. We didn’t know it. Now we know it affects elderly people with heart problems and other problems. If they have other problems, that’s what it really affects. That’s it. You know, in some States, thousands of people, nobody young below the age of 18, like nobody. They have a strong immune system. Who knows? Take your hat off to the young because they have a hell of an immune system, but it affects virtually nobody. It’s an amazing thing. By the way, open your schools. Everybody open your schools. Sleepy Joe Biden wants to impose a $4 trillion tax site, ban American energy, destroy the suburbs, give free healthcare to illegal aliens. How about that one? You know the bad part about that? We all have heart. We want to take care of people. Probably that is everybody’s going to come to the United States. People that weren’t even thinking about it, they’re going to say, “Oh man, these idiots are giving free healthcare, free college education. They’re giving free everything. They’re giving a Rolls Royce to every family that enters through the Southern border.” Remember I said that jokingly and CNN said, “He misrepresented. They are not getting a Rolls Royce.” I agree. Now they’re sick. They are sick. And indoctrinate your children with poisonous anti-American lies. They’re doing that. We’re stopping it. To combat the toxic left-wing propaganda in our schools, I announced last week that we’re launching a pro-American lesson plan for students called 1776 Commission. We will teach our children the truth about America, that we are the most exceptional nation on the face of the earth and we are getting better and better all the time. We got to. No party can lead America that will not teach our children to love America. Biden’s running mate, Kamilla. Who likes Kamilla? Does anybody like her? She was the most failed candidate. I mean, she started off good. And every week she went down, down 15 points, 12 points, 11 points, 9 points, six points, five points, four points, two points. Didn’t she leave at about two or one? She was heading down to the basement. She was so mean to him. I felt sorry for him. No, I did. I felt sorry. So she called them everything from a racist to a MeTooer. He was MeToo. He was a part of the MeToo generation. What she called him, what she said. So I brilliantly said, “Well, he can’t pick Pocahontas because she was too nasty. How nasty was she to Bloomberg? Was she unbelievable? Boy, he was standing there. What happened? What happened? No, actually. What happened? Mini Mike. He’s another beauty. He’s a real beauty. Mini Mike, what happened? What the hell happened? He hit her so hard. Remember? She hits him with about 30 different things, and I’m not talking about our president. He thought she was talking about me. Can you believe it? And I’m not talking. I’m talking about you. He said, “Get me out of here. Get me out of here.” And now he wants to buy his way back into the Democrat party. He wants to buy his way back into the Democrats. He hasn’t taken enough abuse. If I were him, I’d sort of either ride it out or stay with the good Trump economy and get even richer. Biden’s running made even urged supporters to help the bail riders out of jail. You saw that? Including one who attempted to murder a police officer and a man accused of sexually assaulting an eight year old child. Now they’re trying to free them on bail. They’re putting up the money to get them out by this plan to appease the domestic terrorist. And that’s what it is. My plan is to arrest the domestic terrorist, and that’s what we’re doing for many people in jail. Many people. Remember what I told you about the monuments? This is remembrance. Isn’t it beautiful? We don’t see that anymore. Have you seen a monument knocked down recently? No, we don’t see it anymore. I don’t know. We want to rip down Abraham Lincoln. It got to Lincoln. First, it was not too many people heard of him. Confederate soldiers, et cetera. You say, “Hey, look, do it through a process.” But they started hitting Lincoln. Then they hit Gandhi. Now Gandhi was about peace. Gandhi just wanted peace. Leave me alone. Peace, peace, peace. Let’s rip them down. They’re sick people. The Democrat party’s war on cops has already led to a surge in vicious murders in Democrat control cities costing countless black lives. If Biden and the left gain power, they will dismantle police departments nationwide. I’ll tell you, the community that’s most hurt, most hurt by what they’re doing and there is the black community, the Hispanic community. And we’re doing great in the polls with the black community and the Hispanic community. And the Asian community. We’re doing great. In fact, we did so well last night on one poll, they said it must be a typo. They did. It must be an error. It wasn’t. It’s no error. You’re going to find out on November 3rd it’s no error. As president, I always stand and I will always stand with the men and women of law enforcement. They’re great people. They’re very brave people. Not easy, and they don’t get support. We have to give them back their dignity. We have to let them do their job. That’s very simple. They’re great. We’re joined tonight by two high school football players. They became very, very famous. They became more famous than President Trump. They were beautiful. I watched them running through the crowds with those flags. Here’s some place, I don’t know, you got a lot of people here. We’re going to try and figure it out. Hold up your flag. Jared Bentley and Brady Williams, who were recently suspended from their high school football team after displaying flags in support of our police and first responders on the anniversary of September 11th attacks. Where are they? Come up here, fellas. Come up. Come up here. Come up here. Secret Service is thrilled about this. See, these young kids can hop over the fence like it’s nothing. Come up here. They’re good looking kids. I want to congratulate you. You become famous. They’re going to go to Hollywood. They’re going to become movie actors right now. Right? You feel good about it? How's your team doing? How's your team? How's it doing? He said it could be better. You know what? You’re doing great. And everybody out here loves you and they appreciate you. You did a great job. Good job, fella. Good job. Good luck. Is your arm okay? Good. You all right? Good. Good guys. Good guys. Jared and Brady, thank you for supporting the heroes in our law enforcement. We all love you. I’m telling you. You really set something up that’s incredible, and thank your parents for letting you do it. I watched. You ask your parents approval. Isn’t that nice? You know what the father said? “You better do it.” Right? That’s great. Thank you very much, fellas. Great job. Really great job. Country has a lot of respect. Speaking about warriors, we’re also joined tonight by some great, great congressmen who are warriors and they represent Ohio so well and they love you and they love our country. Representative Bob Latta. Thank you, Bob. Great job. They like you, Bob. That’s very good. Good job, Bob. Thank you very much. Congressman Warren Davidson. You know Warren. Thank you, Warren. Great job, Warren. Congressman Mike Turner. A great lawyer, actually. Thank you, Mike. Great job, Mike. You’re really great. Ohio treasurer Robert Sprague. Robert, thank you. Thanks. Good treasurer. Ohio auditor Keith Faber. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much, Keith. Ohio House speaker, Bob Cupp. Where is he? Thank you, Bob. Great job. Ohio Senate president, Larry Obhof. Thank you. Thank you, Larry Obhof. Larry is a good man. How’s it going, Larry? Good. You’re doing a good job. Huh? You’re doing good. How are we doing, Larry? Is it going good? You’re right about that. You’re doing a great job. Thanks, Larry. I appreciate it. Ohio GOP chairman Jane Timken. She’s unbelievable. Thank you, Jane. How are we doing, Jane? How’s it going? How does it compare to four years ago, Jane? Up higher. All right. Good. Good. I think we are. I think we are. A friend of mine that I’ll tell you, this is the greatest optimist. When I thought we had to be down, we lost a lot of the top, top support. The head of the Republican party, little things like that. I said, “We don’t have a head of the Republican party. He left because you had a terrible governor in this state.” Terrible. Your previous governor was terrible. He was terrible. I’ll tell you, I got this man. I didn’t know him. Within about a week, I said, “Man, this guy’s a big optimist.” And he was right. He called it right to the thing. He ran my campaign. When he came back for the second time, we had him in a high position. I said, “Bob, I think you’re great. You’re doing a great job. I want you back in Ohio. We have to do it again.” Bob Paduchik. Where’s Bob? Thank you. Thank you, Bob. Get over here, Bob. Thank you, Bob. He wants no glamor. He wants no glory. He just wants to win. He called it right down to the bone. We had a rough couple of days. I said, “Bob, how we doing?” “You went up two points.” I said, “You got to be kidding.” But we did. So much evolves around Ohio and it’s just a state that we have a relationship with. It’s a great state. We’ve done a great job for you and you’ve done a great job for us. So we appreciate it very much. Thank you. Together, we’ve spent the last four years reversing the damage done by the Democrats and Joe Biden over a 47 year period. Think of it. He’s always talking about, “You should have done this. You should have done that.” He really just left office. It’s not that long ago, right? He’s been there for years and years and now he should have done. He’s never going to do anything. He’s never going to do anything. Guy is a stone cold loser. Biden supported every globalist sellout of Ohio workers for over a half a century, including NAFTA, China’s entry into the World Trade Organization, the disaster known as TPP and how about the Paris Climate Accord? That’s another beauty. I’ll tell you, that was designed to hurt our country. You would have lost trillions of dollars, closed your factories all over the place. In the meantime, China didn’t kick in for another 10 years. The whole thing was a rigged deal. I tell you, I said, “I’m going to get killed for this one, but we’re going to terminate.” And you know what? The people got it right away. Everybody understood. That was another rip off of our country. This state lost one in three manufacturing jobs after the NAFTA and China disasters. Joe Biden is a shameless phony who pretends… He doesn’t have a clue. What the hell? We’re talking like he knows. He’s got guys around him that are pretty smart. They’re radical left. He’s going to do whatever they tell him to do. He pretends to care about blue collar workers. After spending more than five decades in Washington, he tells me, “Why didn’t you do this? Why didn’t you do that?” You see these fake commercials. “Why didn’t you do it?” I said, “I’ve only been here three and a half years. This guy has been here for 47 years. He didn’t do anything.” History says when you’re here for 47 years and you fail, it’s not going to happen. But he was closing your factories, opening your borders, outsourcing your jobs and inflicting economic carnage on your towns and you know that. And I came along and you had the greatest couple of years you’ve ever had. To save our auto industry, I withdrew from the transpacific partnership with [inaudible 00:17:38]. My actions saved countless jobs across Ohio and here in Toledo, the home of the Jeep, right? The home of the Jeep. That’s good. That’s a great brand. They’ve done a great job with Jeep. Jeep. Everyone loves Jeep. Earlier this year, I kept my promise to Ohio when we ended the NAFTA nightmare. I proudly signed the brand new US-Mexico-Canada agreement in July. That’s a big difference. Like day and night. It’s working out great too. It’s working out great. You know how I know that it’s a good deal for us? Because they don’t like it. I took the toughest ever action to stand up to China’s rampant theft of Ohio jobs. We achieved American energy. We passed record tax cuts and regulations. Our energy independence is incredible. We have now energy independence. We don’t have to be in these far away lands anymore. Now we’ll be there to help certain allies that have been great, but we don’t have to be. Since my election, natural gas production in Ohio has surged 63%. They want to close it up. By the way, you do know they want to close it up. They want to close up all fracking natural gas ever. They want to close it up. This would kill at least 700,000 Ohio jobs. Probably more than a million. While I’m president, America will remain the number one producer of oil and natural gas and Ohio workers will continue leading the way. I just left the great state of Texas, and I talked to a lot of people like this, a great crowd of people. We have tremendous support all over the country. I’ll tell you what. These people are great. And here’s the platform that they have. Sleepy Joe Biden. No oil, no religion, no God, and no guns. Now I’m in Texas. It’s a really rough thing in Ohio, but now we’re talking Texas. No oil, that doesn’t work well in Texas, right? No guns. That doesn’t work well in Texas. No God. Look what they’re doing to the churches and everything. That doesn’t work. No God. No religion. That doesn’t work well. You would have to be George Washington with your running mate would be Abraham Lincoln. Okay. Your VP candidate. And you’d still lose very big. And then they say “Yeah, he’s doing okay. He’s two up in Texas.” They said it last time too, that Texas is even, four years ago. And everybody said, “No, I think Trump is killing it.” We’d have stadiums with 25,000, 30,000 people, much more that couldn’t get in. We’d have 40,000, 50,000 people outside and they’d say I was even. We won in a landslide, just like we won this state, in a landslide. You know the expression they use, “Texas is in play.” You know what “in play” means? It could go either way. And guys would get on there and say, “I don’t think so.” And then that night again, “The polls in Texas have closed. Donald Trump has won the great state of Texas.” I mean, the whole thing is crazy. It’s crazy, it’s crazy. You know what they do? It’s suppression polls. They try and depress you. They try and make you unhappy so you go out to dinner with your wife, your husband, you go out to dinner, “Darling, let’s have dinner. It’s so sad. We love Donald, but he just can’t make it. He can’t make it. Let’s go out, have dinner. We’ll come home and watch the results.” Except 2016 came and nobody did that, they all went out and voted and we kicked ass. Tell me, was that the most exciting evening in the history of television? Did you ever see the ratings, the combined ratings? I think the biggest ever. But was that the most exciting? 2016, was that the most exciting evening in the history of television? We invested $2.5 trillion in the U.S. military, including more than $6 billion in contracts. I’ll tell you what, you like the word pronounced Lima or Lima, because I saved Lima. And I tell you what, I saved Lima. I came here and they were going to close that plant in Lima. They were going to close the tank plant. It was done. And I said, “Why are we closing a tank plant?” And I got a couple of calls from my friends, the Congressman right here. And I got calls. And Jim Jordan called me. Do you like Jim Jordan? He’s great. And I looked at this army tank plant in Lima. I said, “Why are we closing it?” And I saw the people building the tanks and the technology’s incredible. And if you ever closed it, you’d never be able to open a thing like that again. So I overrode the generals, I overrode everybody, and now we’re making a record number of tanks in that plant and it’s absolutely thriving. But we had tremendous success. We took 100% of the ISIS caliphate and we killed the founder and leader of ISIS, Al-Baghdadi. We took out the world’s number one terrorist and the mass murder of American troops and many other people. Qasem Soleimani is dead. He’s dead. I withdrew from last administration’s disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal. They paid $150 billion, plus $1.8 billion in cash. You know they got? Nothing. They got nothing. I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. Every president for many, many decades said they were going to do it. They never did it. They never did it. They didn’t have the guts to do it. They campaigned on it, they were all going to do it. Then they got there, there was a lot of pressure put on them. A lot of pressure put on me. Every leader was calling all over. “Please don’t do it. Please don’t do it. Mr. President, please don’t do it. Don’t do it. Don’t move it. Just leave it the way it is. It’s okay.” But I promised and I said, “I’m going to do it.” And then I got calls from the biggest people in the world. Kings, I got calls from presidents, from prime ministers, “Please, please don’t tell it.” Then I got calls, “Please have him call me back me,” me. I said, “Look, tell everybody I’m out for three days. I’m not going to be able to call them back.” I had a news conference, we announced it. Then I called everybody back. “Hey, how you doing? How’s everything going? Everything going good?” “Yeah, well, I wanted to talk to you about Israel, but it’s too late. You already did it.” And we did it and we got it done and nobody else got it done. And it’s something we had to do. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. And instead of endless wars, we are forging peace all over the Middle East. And you saw that. And I’m the only man that got nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize and I didn’t get any press. They wouldn’t. For two of them. Last week, I’m not bragging about it, I’m just saying, I’m the President of the United States because of Kosovo-Serbia, they’ve been killing each other for years, I worked out a deal for them. I got nominated. And then Israel with Bahrain and UAE, and many more to come. I mean, they all want to do it. We’ll have peace in the Middle East without blood all over the sand. No blood. We’re going to have peace in the Middle East. So I was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. And I told this story last night. Should I tell it or not? Should I? Yes. She wants me to do it. So I go home to our great First Lady. I said, “First Lady, you’re going to be so proud of me tonight. I was nominated not once but twice for totally separate events by different people.” Great people. “First lady, I was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.” I was like this. “I was nominated.” It’s a big deal for our country, right? And she said, “Oh, that’s good.” I said, “Let’s turn on the evening news. Let’s watch it. This is going to be a big show tonight. Get ready.” And NBC, which is one of the most crooked, one of the worst newscasts, and I’m talking about normal NBC, not MSDNC. MSDNC is the worst. So I turned on NBC with Lester Holt, another beauty. And they start with a hurricane and then they went to something, and something else. And I’m saying, “First Lady, this is getting a little embarrassing. We’re 20 minutes into a half hour show. They haven’t mentioned the Nobel Peace Prize.” And then it went through the whole show and they never mentioned. Then I got nominated for a second one. They never mentioned. And when Barack Obama, Barack Hussein Obama got nominated, now when Barack Hussein Obama got nominated, he didn’t know why he was nominated. It was like right at the very beginning. He didn’t do anything. He did nothing and he got nominated. It was the biggest story I’ve ever seen. But that’s okay. In the meantime, we’re President and they’re not. No, that’s right. You would think if you nominated for the Nobel Prize, you’d get maybe half a second. The First Lady, she said, “Sorry, darling. That’s the way it goes, isn’t it?” Joe Biden opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden. He opposed killing Soleimani. He voted for the Iraq War disaster. He backed the disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal. And he cheered the rise of China as a very positive development for our country. “Oh, it’s really great.” If it were up to Sleepy Joe, bin Laden and Soleimani would be alive today, ISIS would be on a rampage, Iran would control the Middle East, and China would be the dominant power anywhere in the world. And I want to tell you, if you go back a few months before this pandemic, we were gaining, gaining, gaining. We had an insurmountable lead on China. I always heard they were going to catch us by 2019 for 10 years. We were so far beyond, we were doing much better than they were. The Biden agenda would obliterate our economy. He destroyed social security, destroyed protections for pre-existing conditions. That’s what he’s going to do, drain your Medicare by giving away your healthcare to illegal immigrants. He would end our travel ban to jihadist regions and increase refugee admissions by, listen to this, over 700%. And this is the manifesto with Bernie Sanders, with Crazy Bernie. He made this deal with Crazy Bernie. And by the way, a lot of the Crazy Bernie voters last time, four years ago, voted for Trump because of trade, because the one thing they do understand, that our country has been off for years. Biden opposes school choice and vowed to ban charter schools. Very important to have them. In a second term, I will provide school choice to every parent in America. They’re totally against it. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans. And just, in conclusion, first of all, it’s been a great honor to be with you. This is, really, it’s a great state. They’re great people. I really mean it. No, I really mean it. Get out there on November 3rd. We’ve got to win this one big. This is a bad, bad ideology. This is probably a step beyond socialism. I really think in many ways, it’s communism we’re talking about. This is a step beyond. Socialism’s no good. Communism’s really bad. But get out there on November 3rd and let’s show him your stuff and show them the stuff of all of us. So, in concluding, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we will end the reliance, this ridiculous, crazy reliance on China, and all of these far away lands once and for all. We will make our medical supplies right here in the United States. We will hire more police. And by the way, thank you, police. Thank you, law enforcement. Increased penalties for assaults on law enforcement and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. We will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens and we will keep America out of these ridiculous, stupid, endless, foreign wars. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military. Our military might has never been like it is right now because of what we’ve done. And we had no choice, and hope to God we never have to use it, because if you would ever see the power of what we’ve done over the last three years, it’s almost better for you not to see it. We are the envy of every power, every country in the world. We have weapons that nobody ever even thought possible. And just as I said, hope to God we never have to use them. And the way we don’t have to use them is to keep that kind of strength. Nobody’s going to be talking to us. We’re going to have peace through strength, and it’s all made in the U.S.A. Made in the U.S.A. We’ll end surprise medical billing, require price transparency. I’ve already signed it into law. Kicks in on January 1st. It’s going to cut your bills down to a level that you wouldn’t believe. That doesn’t mean the drug companies and the hospital and corporations are happy with me. But that’s okay. And further reduce health insurance premiums and the cost of prescription drugs by 50%, 60% and 70%. Big pharma does not like me too much. They’re taking ads about me that are so bad, but you get it, you understand it. They’re not too thrilled with me, including the rebates. The rebates go back to you. The rebates before went back to very rich people. We will strongly protect Medicare and social security, and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. And America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. That’s what’s happening. NASA is again the leading space station anywhere in the world. There’s nothing like a space center, what we’ve done. And there was grass growing in the runways when I took over three and a half years ago. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, “In God we trust.” For years, you had a President who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great state of Ohio. So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your co-workers, get everybody, and get out and vote. Got to get out and vote. And in your state, in Ohio, early voting has already begun and don’t wait. And when you see them cheating on the other side, I don’t say if, when, when you see them cheating with those ballots, all of those unsolicited ballots, those millions of ballots, you’ll see them, anytime you do, report them to the authorities. The authorities awaiting and watching. From Akron to Columbus, from Cincinnati to Queen City, I know it weller than Cleveland, and from Dayton to Toledo, we inherit the legacy of generations of Ohio patriots, like Neil Armstrong, Annie Oakley, William McKinley, and the amazing Ulysses S. Grant, that’s good. Nobody’s stock has gone up like Grant. Nobody in the last 10 years. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blazed the trails, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, raised up the skyscrapers, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world, and you haven’t seen anything yet. Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God, and together with the incredible people of Ohio, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Ohio. Get out and vote. Thank you.

"66","09-22-20","Thank you very much Pittsburgh, a great place. You have always treated me well. Thank you, Pittsburgh. Thank you very much. I’m thrilled to be back in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Hard working Americans patriots, and by the way, the home of the Pittsburgh Steelers, congratulations. Good team. Great quarterback, don’t you think? I think he’s great. Big Ben, right? Big Ben … We’re going to lift our nation to extraordinary new heights. We’re going to turn the page forever on the failed political class, and that’s exactly what we’ve been doing. We’re going to defend our jobs, our families, our borders, and our treasured way of life. Remember, we now put America first, we do it, been a long time. It’s been a long time. This is the most important election in the history of our country, I believe that. This election is a matter of economic survival for Pennsylvania. You had the greatest year you’ve ever had last year, and you’re really on your way. We were very, very sadly disturbed by what happened with China. They let the plague out, they shouldn’t have done it, but you’re now on your way. We closed it up, we saved millions of lives. That’s the bottom line. We’d closed it up, we saved millions of lives. I will tell you, you see what’s happening, you see the numbers as well as I do. You are on your way to, I think maybe, economically the best year, this next year will be the best year we’ve had. The third quarter, wait till you look at the third quarter, look at the numbers. They will be out before the election, but I predict they’ll be very good. By the way, if they’re not, I deny I ever said it. I deny it. But, I’m pretty confident they’re going to be incredible probably the best ever. Under my administration, we proudly achieved energy independence. Don’t forget, I am not the candidate, two candidates that said we’re not going to have fracking. We’re going to ban fracking. He said that for a year. Then all of a sudden, he said, “Well, maybe we’ll have some fracking.” By the way, that’s not going to last because the radical left won’t let him get away with it. I’m all for fracking. I was in Texas, well, it’s a big part of your economy. It’s energy. It’s just a tremendous part, but I was in Texas two weeks ago and my opponent is against oil, guns, and God. I just spoke to the governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, a great guy. He said, “I think you’re up 15, sir.” I said, “Well, the fake news says I’m up four.” He said, “You’re not up four.” I won it by a lot less. Remember last time with you, with Texas, with many states, it’s too close to call. We don’t know. Then, boom, the polls close. They say Trump won, Trump won, Trump won. We won a lot. I won Pennsylvania because of you. I won Pennsylvania and you had your best year. So I mean, that’s the way it’s supposed to work. I think we’re going to win a lot. Don’t forget, last time I came in, I said I was going to give you the tax cuts as regulation cuts. I said we’re going to do big things with energy, big things with steel. Your steel mills, every one of them would have been closed and gone had I not won, but I said I was going to do all these things. So, it’s tougher. Now, I’ve done everything I said and more. I’ve done more. I’ve done more than I said. So, this should be easier. I hear we’re doing really well. I know we’re doing really well based on, you know, we came in with a lot of your great congressman. I said, “How are we doing?” They said, “You’re going to win it by a lot.” But, we better with it. We got to go out. We got to vote. But powered by the incredible workers of your state. You are now really, if you look at it, the number one producer, think of it. We are as a nation, your state is, you have no idea how big an energy, you know how big you are in energy. People don’t think of Pennsylvania that way. Do you have any idea? As a nation, we’re the biggest in the world by far not even close and we are energy independent. Think of that. But no longer is America at the mercy of these foreign suppliers and all of the people that took advantage of us for so many years. We now don’t have to be in other parts of the world. We’re there perhaps to help allies. We’re there perhaps to help good people, but we’re not there because we need their energy, because we need their oil. Instead, we’re the dominant energy producer. We’re going to keep it that way. We’re going to always have it that way. This, by the way, our opponents, they don’t want petroleum products. Okay? They want wind. Let’s open up wind. Let’s have some wind and every once in a while, the wind will blow and you’ll produce a couple of things and then you can close down your plant for the rest of the season. You can watch those birds fly out of the sky. Gee. I always say it’s a bird graveyard under the windmills. Doesn’t have the power. Doesn’t have the staying power. You see what’s happening in California. Blackouts, rolling blackouts. How would you like that in Pennsylvania? The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Darling, what’s wrong? I can’t watch Trump on television. I can’t watch our president. Darling, we have a rolling blackout. It’ll only be a few hours. I think we’ll be on by two o’clock in the morning, darling, and we can watch a rerun. Now, this is what’s happening. You have rolling blackouts. You have, in some cases, just blackouts. I don’t even call them rolling. Not going to happen to your state. Last year, I visited the Shell petrochemical plant in Beaver County, Pennsylvania, the largest investment in your state’s history. That was all made possible by our pro energy policies. We’ve done it a lot. In Louisiana, we’re building some of the largest plants you’ve ever seen, largest in the world and it’s incredible, all related to energy, but your security and your jobs are in very grave peril, because the radical left maniacs, they don’t want to have anything to do with energy. They don’t want anything to do with, they have different concepts, right? They have the green new deal, whether it will be no energy, almost of any kind. No, it’s crazy. Thought of by AOC plus three. You know AOC? Not a good student, not good at anything, but she’s got a good line of crap. I’ll tell you. She’s got a hell of a [inaudible 00:09:21] and she’s got them. She’s radical left, but she’s not as bad as some of them. How about Omar of Minnesota? We’re going to win the state of Minnesota because of her, they say. He’s telling us how to run our country. How did you do where you came from? How is your country doing? She’s going to tell us, she’s telling us how to run our country. You know what? The Democrats in Congress, you have to see what they are doing. Their stance on Israel, it’s like a whole different world. It’s like from 10 years ago, it’s like a different world and we want to keep our world the way it was and the way it’s going to be. We’ve got the greatest country on earth and we’re going to keep it that way. We don’t need socialist and we don’t need communist telling us how to run our country. I do this every night and a lot of times it’s a waste. I did it last night. We were … Did you see the crowd we had last night? We were in a great place, Ohio. We had a crowd. We had a crowd. You couldn’t see the end of it. I said, “Turn around camera, turn around.” But, they never liked doing that, you know? They don’t like spinning those cameras. They don’t want to show the crowd. They don’t like showing. They don’t like showing, show the crowd and this is … it’s an honor. Let me tell you. Look, I used to think that was a difficulty like it was a new camera that can’t turn, but then whenever there was like a problem, like there’d be a little argument or some kind of an anti-Trump person, you don’t see that much. I don’t want to bring it on, but you don’t see it much anymore. You know why? It’s dangerous. It’s dangerous for them, but you know, I’d see the camera would never move, whenever where there’s something like a little negative happening, that thing would turn around like a pretzel. I said, “Oh, it does move.” But, they never want to show the crowds. They never, last night. Now, I went home and I tell you this, I go home all the time. First lady, “How’d you like the crowd?” Sir, I didn’t see it. I didn’t see it, but I didn’t see it, Donald. I didn’t see it. Sometimes she’ll call me Mr. President, but she’s only kidding. Believe me. She’s only kidding. Has she been a great first lady, right? She’s been a great first lady and very popular. She’s really done a great job. She works hard. We have some great people here tonight. I brought certain members of my family, but I’m going to introduce them to you in a little bit, okay? Great family. They work hard. I’ll tell you what, they work hard. They really work hard. But I do wish they would show because it would be, you know, it’s actually better for them if they show. It shows the importance. The only thing you can do is show. I’ll say, “How did it look?” I don’t know how it looked, but the sound was phenomenal. Okay? It sounded like a Penn state football game like the Steelers football game. You can’t disguise it. You ever see Sleepy Joe with the little circles? Oh, you can. He puts them very far away, so far away. Then he comes up with the mask. He’s like a hundred yards from the nearest human being. He’s got a … He feels good about the mask. I wonder in the debate it’ll be him and I or the stage. Is he going to walk in with a mask? I’ll be honest, he feels good about the mask and that’s okay. You know what, whatever makes you feel good. He feels good. He feels, I mean, honestly, what the hell did he spend all that money on the plastic surgery if he’s going to cover it up with a mask. Seriously. The whole [inaudible 00:13:41] No, I think he’ll come in with a mask. I don’t know. I have no idea. Well, the question is, will he leave it on during the debate? Because it’s a little hard and I’m all for mask when you need them, I’m up, but when you’re making a speech and the nearest person’s like where you are and you’re in a stage all by yourself and then he had a habit of taking it off and it hangs down on his ear as he’s speaking, it makes him feel comfortable. Honestly, whatever makes you feel good is okay with me, but it’ll be interesting. I’m going to be, we’re going to have a big rating on that. He’s been doing it all his life. He’s been doing it for 47 years and I’ve just started doing this stuff. I’m just starting. But, I’m just thinking, but I did it more in 47 months than he did in 47 years. That’s true. That’s true. You look at what we’ve done. No, it’s true. That’s actually true. He did a lot of negative stuff too. You have to deduct that out. When asked if there would be any place for fossil fuels, including coal and fracking in a Biden administration, Joe replied, “No, we would make sure that it’s all eliminated.” All of a sudden, he gets the nomination. He’s been trying to get the nomination for decades. He finally get, and that was prime time for him, which was never great. He never got more than 1%. We called it. Remember, I called him his first nickname was 1% Joe. Frankly, had Elizabeth Warren been loyal to her philosophy, which is radical left, socialism, perhaps communism. I don’t know, perhaps. It’s verging on communism, right? But had she been loyal, she would’ve left. She would have quit. She had no chance. She was out. Pocahontas. She was gone. Remember, I said, ” I have more Indian blood in me than you have and I have none.” I’d love to have some, but I don’t happen to have any. Then she choked and she went out and got a test. She announced she had 1024th, right? 1,000. That means, like I said it last night, that means around 700 or 800 years ago, somewhere, there was a little bit of a relationship going and that’s okay. Seven, 800 years ago, maybe. What a phony she is. It’s terrible. Now, we’re going to pick a great woman, any one of the five that I told you, but any one of the women that we had they’re all great people, great scholars, great, brilliant people. A lot of people. No, they’re all great women. They’re brilliant. Great scholars. By the way, while I’m here, would anybody prefer that I pick a man? Is there any man that has the courage to raise your hand? There’s one right there. I got one. We found one. No, we’re going to pick an incredible one, brilliant woman and watch the abuse that she will take. Whoever … The decision’s going to be announced on Saturday, 5:00 on Saturday at the White House. You see, we have tremendous Republican support. Two people. Always got to be two. Always got to be the two. Those two. We have great support from the Republican party, tremendous support. It’s never been this unified before ever, ever and the fake impeachment. We had 196 to nothing Republican support. We had 52 and a half to a half in the Senate. Who is the half? I can’t imagine. I can’t. Buddy was very good today. I have to tell you, he was good. Now, I’m happy. Thank you, Mitt. Thank you. No, he was very good, very positive statement, but days ago, Biden reiterated his pledge to require net zero carbon emissions. That’s basically saying, you know what that is? There’ll be no more oil. There’ll be no more gas. There’ll be no more nothing. There’ll be no more industry. There’ll be no more country. That’s what it’s like really. That would instantly shut down all fracking and all mining immediately in Pennsylvania sending your jobs overseas, sending your money to somebody else, not you. I’ll keep your jobs in Pennsylvania where they belong and you’re going to be doing fracking for a long time. I can say the same because you are really big in energy. I can say the same thing to you as I say in Texas. So, they don’t want oil. They don’t want fracking, right? They don’t want the energy that we know that powers these massive plants because the other stuff is wonderful. It’s not going to do it. It’s not going to do it. So, they don’t like oil. They don’t like the gas. They don’t like God, religion, churches are close. How about these states? They still have churches closed. By the way, your governor hasn’t been so great. You know that, right? Are your churches still closed? They’re still closed. They’re doing it for a reason. By the way, November 4th, they’ll announce, “We’ve decided to open up.” Okay? They’re trying to make our numbers as bad as possible. So, California’s closed. Pennsylvania’s closed. North Carolina’s closed. Michigan is closed. That’s another beauty right there, Michigan’s closed. Then they have these fake ballots, millions and millions of ballots. By the way, when not if, when you see shenanigans, please report it to your authorities. Okay? The real authorities, they’re watching and the authorities are watching, but please report it. But when you look at it, really, it’s amazing. They’re trying to make our numbers look bad, but even with numerous closed states and you notice also law and order, right? Law and order, the red states, the Republican states, they’re working great. Record low crime, record low, but Democrat run states, you look at Chicago, you look at New York, New York has gone through a … We have to bring back. We should draft Rudy Giuliani. Okay? Let’s bring him back. Draft Rudy. We want Rudy. Rudy, Rudy. I’ll tell you Rudy is amazing, but he did a great job. New York was in big trouble. He came in and he just was tough, smart, and it became the safest big city. Now, we have a man where some categories of crime were up 300%. He fired 1,000. He fired a lot of police, I guess, a billion dollars a year worth of police, worth of great police, firemen and women. It’s a terrible thing. I love that place so much and it’s so sad to see what’s happening to New York. We’re going to make a little bit of a play for New York. In theory, the Democrats automatically win New York, but I do phenomenally in most parts. Then one part, it’s automatic, but I can’t imagine that particular part is going to be very happy. So, we’re going to make a play for New York. With Pennsylvania, I don’t have to make a play. We’ve got Pennsylvania. Just go out of here. We don’t have to make a play. We don’t have to. It’s a great, you know, for years though Pennsylvania was a place that Republicans just didn’t win. For many years, everybody thought they were going to win, every Republican. So yeah, we’re going to win Pennsylvania. They thought they were going to win it and they didn’t. I came along and we won it and we won it quite easily. Quite easy. I think we’re going to do even better now, because remember, number one in the history of your state last year, and that’s because of what we did, we stopped the dumping. We saved your stell. So many different things, but Pennsylvania is the home of American energy. Think of it that way. This has taken place over a very short period of time. Also, the birthplace of a thing called the American constitution. Right? American constitution. To uphold our constitution as written as opposed to as conceived by some radical left judge, I will soon be announcing that nominee. You’re going to love it. You’re going to be so happy. If you don’t love it, don’t vote for me. Okay? You don’t like it. My opponent refuses to release a list of justices. I was told that a big thing when I was running last time, nobody really knew me. They knew me very well. We had great success at The Apprentice and in business and it was great, but they never knew what kind of a judge I would pick or to be a justice, right? A justice of the Supreme Court. I said, “I mean, what am I going to do? How am I going to solve that problem?” But, I was in politics, never. Don’t forget, when I ran, they said, “No, he’s inexperienced.” I ran against some very talented people. Some of whom are very good friends of mine. Some of whom I don’t like too much. When I don’t like somebody, it last for a long time, but I said, “Well, how do we solve that problem?” I don’t know. They just weren’t believing. The appointment of a United States Supreme Court justice was much more important to the voters than I thought. And they’re right, because they will set policy for 50 years and they’ll set policy, whether it’s life, whether it’s second amendment. The second amendment, if I weren’t president, you know the pressure, your second amendment would be obliterated. It would maybe be gone, but at a minimum obliterated, they haven’t touched your second amendment. Not even touched it. Because I’m here to block. I’m a blocking force. I’m like a lineman for the Pittsburgh Steelers. I’m a blocking force. No, they haven’t touched it. But your second amendment would be under siege. So nobody knew. I never knew. You hear about Supreme Court, you know about Supreme Court, you know about other judges, by the way at the end of the first term, we’ll be close to 300 federal judges, including court of appeals, which I think is a record. I guess it’s a record. It’s a lot. That’s a lot. Nobody’s done that. It’s record. Think of that. 300. That’s a big percentage of the entire judiciary. Think of that. 300. And many, many court of appeals judges, but two great Supreme Court judges or justices. And now we’re going to get a third. Can you imagine our enemies? Three in one term. So many presidents, they just don’t have the chance and it’s so important. But I said to my people, I said, so if they don’t believe me, what I’ll do is I’ll make up a list of 25 judges or people and we’ll tell them, “I will only pick from that list.” They said, “That sounds like an interesting idea.” This was my idea. When you’ve never run for office before you have to have a little bit of imagination. So I got out a list, I named the people, the people are good, and I said, “And I promise that I will pick someone like the people on this list.” And it didn’t work. It went nowhere because they didn’t trust it. They said, “We want you to pick the people on the list, not somebody like the people on the list.” So I went back the next week, I said, “I will pick somebody that’s on this list.” And they were all great, great judges for the most part, I think almost entirely, but judges and really respected conservative believers in our country, solid, incredible people. And as soon as I did that, things went through the roof. It was amazing how important it was. By the way, would you stand up with that beautiful jacket? I love this guy. How many times- How many events? He’s been to a couple. That’s really great. Thank you very much. I’ve seen him before. He’s been here a couple of times, like about 90. Thank you, man. That’s really nice. I’m going to get one of those jackets. By the way, the wall. The wall, yeah, 330 miles. 330 miles. 330 miles. And yes, we have a great relationship with Mexico. First they said, “He’ll never be able to build it.” The Democrats were just brutal. I made a terrible mistake, I said it last night, I should have said, “We will not under any circumstances build a wall at our Southern border.” They would have given me all the money in the world. But stupidly, I said, “We will build a wall.” And the Democrats said, “Let’s not give it to him.” But we got it, we won. We won court cases, we won court cases. I won so much money we could build four walls if we wanted. So then they said, “All right, all right.” They’ve lost. So by the way, we’re up to 330, the exact wall. Their dream choice. I said to the border patrol, I love these people, they’re great, ICE, the border patrol, what they do is incredible. They’re incredible. I said, “Give me your dream wall, as long as we’re building we might as well build a wall that you want. Let’s build it right.” “Sir, we have to have vision. We need steel and concrete.” I said, “How about one or the other?” They said, “No, sir, we need steel and concrete. We need steel. Inside those poles we have rebar and we have concrete and they’re 30 feet tall. We need all sorts of things. We need them to be wired.” I won’t tell you why they’re wired, but they’re wired for a reason. They’re all wired up and they’re incredible. But you know what? We got the wall. Nobody could have done it. So once we had the wall and it started going up and then we hit a hundred miles, 200 miles, now we’re at 330, and we’re building 10 miles a week and it’ll be finished very soon. And we have the most secure border in terms of drug trafficking, trafficking coming along and we’ve done phenomenally well. Because that’s a lot of the territory that we need. We’re going to go up to probably a little bit over 500 miles, so we’re at 330. But once they saw that I had it, they said, “Yeah, but Mexico’s not paying for it.” But they are paying for it, Mexico’s paying for the wall. They are paying for it. They’re paying at the border. They’re paying for the wall. All those trucks that go back and forth. They’re paying for the wall. So the Democrats said, “Yeah, but Mexico…”, they always have to find something, right? And do you remember what I used to say that if they fight us, remember people would say, “What happens if they fight you on the wall? What happens if they fight you right to hell on the wall?” I said, “The wall would get 10 feet taller.” Took a little hit on that, we took a little bit of a hit, but that’s okay. The wall is a tall sucker, you don’t want to get up to the top. They look down, they say, “Oh, ye, ye, how do we get down off this?” It’s tall and it’s strong and it’s great. And we appreciate, because Mexico has been working with us very closely. They have right now 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our Southern border making sure that people don’t come into our country. I want to thank the president of Mexico. Very helpful. So I made this list of potential justices and I’ll tell you, it all changed. Now I’m asking sleepy Joe Biden to give me a list and he doesn’t want to do it. You know why? Because he can only put super radical left judges on, people that would destroy our country, people that would destroy your country. And he knows that he’s not electable… He shouldn’t be electable anyway. This is the worst candidate. You know where he is today? They have a thing called the LID. I don’t even know. Do you know what LID stands for? LID. He put out a LID today early in the morning. LID means he’s not going to be anywhere today. I’m working my ass off, I’m in Ohio, I’m in Texas, I’m in Florida, I’m in Michigan, I’m in Wisconsin. Man. Thank you. That’s so nice. Well, that is something that one of the fake news reporters back there, they said they’ve never heard of that one. “There was a chant that’s going over the last six or seven rallies saying, ‘We love you.'” That’s never happened to a politician before. Am I a politician? I don’t want to be a politician. I don’t think of myself as a politician. But it really is, I appreciate it. I’ve never heard it. I liked Ronald Reagan, but they never said we love you, or maybe they did. They’re going to try and find out. Then they’ll say, “President Trump lied last night because 40 years ago I remember…” But no, nobody’s ever heard that one before and I appreciate it because it is reciprocal. Thank you very much. Reciprocal. Reciprocal love. It’s reciprocal. I had such a nice life before I did this. I had such a nice life. Then I had the witch hunt that goes on forever. It goes on. And then we catch them spying on our campaign. How about that? Let’s see what happens though. But we caught them spying, all of that, the whole big deal. And then the guys that were doing the investigation, they have their 31 different phones, they were accidentally wiped clean. 31 different phones, I think it was like 19 different people, and they all did the same exact accident. Which if you knew anything about phones, it’s almost an impossibility to do it once. Let alone 31 different times. So we caught them and that’s called obstruction. We have to remember that’s called obstruction. That was the Mueller group. That was a Mueller group. All those phones, they were wiped so clean. And Hillary got a subpoena on the 30. I said, “Forget about these things because you’ll find them. They have them. They’re in the state department.” I have no doubt about it, they’re in the state department but they’ll get them. But you know what? 33,000, they have a request from the US Congress, that’s not bad, US Congress they send a subpoena, very, very important, and after getting the subpoena, she deleted all of her emails and acid washed, and then she took her telephones. I’ve gotten rid of phones too. I throw them away. She took cameras and she beat the hell out of them with a hammer and then threw them away. And they found a couple of them. She was very angry, obviously, if she did the hammer work. But if anyone else said this, there’s a protection, there’s a dual level of justice, but we’re getting down to the bottom of it because it’s not fair to us. Not fair to us. 33,000 emails. She deleted them on the basis that it was all about her daughter’s wedding, Chelsea, and also yoga classes. 33,000 emails on yoga and a wedding. I don’t think so. And Comey said, “Oh, that’s okay. That sounds like a good reason.” That’s Comey. That’s another beauty right there that Comey. But we caught him, we caught him. Very smart move. Getting rid of that guy was a smart move, but we caught him. Listen, we caught him. They were spying on the campaign, they were doing actually worse than that. Nobody’s ever done a thing like this, so let’s see what happens. But we caught him cold, we got so much stuff. Remember the insurance policy, right? From Strzok and Page, two lovers. They were very smart. They would use the public servers and send it over the public wires because they didn’t want to be caught having an affair. So they went over the public. That was a very good thing for us. Wasn’t it? ” Darling, darling, darling, please. She’s going to win. She’s going to win, isn’t she? Peter, Peter only you can save us. Peter, she’s going to win. Yes, darling. She’s going to win. I know. 100,000 to nothing.” Remember that? It was actually 100 million to one. This was a hundred million to one. This is this idiot. So listen, “So darling, please, please tell me again. Yes, 100 million to one she’s going to win. But just in case she doesn’t, we have an insurance policy.” Now that only means one thing. And we went through the insurance policy and we caught them. So let’s see what happens to these treasonous crooks. These terrible people. And they put our nation through turmoil. But I just want to thank… A lot of people were very unfairly treated. You look at General Flynn, look, he’s still going through it. Can you believe it? But a lot of people were unfairly treated by a bunch of treasonous, horrible people. And they used the intelligence agencies of our country to try and steal an election and to try and do a coup. Wouldn’t you think? Who would ever think this country… But that’s all you can say. Some people would say, “Well, that’s a conspiracy theory.” No, just take a look at the records. For me, it’s a very exciting thing because we found something that nobody would have thought possible. Now let’s see what happens. But we have them cold, they spied on our campaign. It’s our campaign And if you want to save America, you have to go out, get out and vote. This is the most important election. In just three and a half years we’ve secured America’s borders, which makes them very unhappy, rebuilt the awesome power of the US military, we built the military. It was totally depleted when I took over. We built a military. Two and a half trillion dollars we spent, all made in the USA, the greatest equipment, the greatest planes and rockets and missiles and our nuclear. I hate to even mention the word and hope to God we never have to use it, but we have the most powerful weapons in the history of the world. And we did that over a very short period of time. Weapons that are so powerful that we’re the envy of the world, but I never want to use those weapons. And hopefully we’ll never have to. You know the way you don’t have to use them, is when you have them. It’s when you have them. But nobody’s ever built force like what we have. And the newspapers and the press and the fake news they went and said, “He just gave away classified information!” I said, “No, I will look you right in the eye,” first of all, I’m allowed to do it, I’m the president, so I’m allowed to actually. I’m the only one that’s allowed to. But no, no, I didn’t give away. I’m just telling you, most powerful weapons ever produced we have, and other countries know that. And it’s a good thing that they know it and I don’t think we’ll ever be using them. And I hope we don’t. I hope to God. I use the word God, because they refuse to use the word God in their pledge of allegiance, right? Twice. I use the word God. I hope to God, we never have to use them. But I obliterated the ISIS caliphate, which was all over the place. 100%. Remember I got it down to 99%. They said, “You got to go a hundred.” I said, “Let’s get out of here. We’re bringing them all back home. Everyone’s coming back home.” Long, long wars. The never ending wars, the endless wars. We fixed our disastrous trade deals, they were a disaster, brought jobs and factories back to Pennsylvania under 16 years. And think of this, for 16 years presidents, Obama, President Bush, household income rose $2,945. That’s over a 16 year period. In three years, your household income rose almost $10,000. When you include energy. You have to include energy. Without energy, almost $7,000. But we have to include energy. I mean, how much are you paying for your gasoline? You never saw $2 gasoline. Less, right? It’s less. They go up, it’s less. It’s a big difference. What is it nowadays? Come on, tell me. I haven’t got any gas. I haven’t stopped recently at a gas station. 15? Okay. Because for a while it was way under two. And we’re going to keep it there. We have so much, we have so much. In my first three years we lifted 6.6 million people out of poverty, the largest poverty reduction in the history of our country, by far. We built the greatest economy in the history of the world. And right now we’re doing it again. I see all these hats, Make America Great Again. And now I’m going to say this, Make America Great Again, Again. Make America Great Again, Again, Again. We saved 1.4 million jobs in Pennsylvania alone and to fight the China virus, it’s the China virus, not the coronavirus. Corona sounds like a place in Italy, a beautiful place. It’s corona. No, it’s the China virus. They don’t want to say it. The radical left, they don’t want to say it. You ever notice they’re always going to have to Russia. Look, nobody’s been tougher on Russia than me. “Russia, Russia, Russia.” I said, “What about China?” They never going to to mention it. They got little deals going on I think. But coronavirus, doesn’t it sound like Italy? A beautiful villa. Corona. No, it’s a China virus. They should have stopped it. To fight the China virus we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II. We did an A+ job, except we did a D job in terms of public relations, explaining it because we were too busy doing it. But the fact is they wouldn’t have written it anyway. It didn’t matter to them. It’s there. It’s their little thing. You have a watch Biden? He can’t talk about it he thinks, so he gets up, “The coronavirus,” they say, “We want to talk about Supreme Court judge today.” Well, I don’t know about that. “The coronavirus.” And he doesn’t know we did a great job, he has no clue. He said, “I should have opened.” He goes, “I should have shut down one week earlier.” What he doesn’t say is he did the worst job in the history of an epidemic or a pandemic with the swine flu. It was a joke. And what he did, his own man, that was in charge said recently, “We had no idea what the hell we were doing. It was a total disaster.” There were amateurs. And now he tells us how to do something that’s far more lethal. But he said, ” They should have closed one week early,” except when it came to closing the border, which I did, which turned out to save tens of thousands of lives, Biden criticized me until two months later when he said I was right. But we should have closed a weak earlier. Think of that. We pioneered lifesaving therapies, reducing the fatality rate 85% since April. Think of that. Remdesivir, the plasmas, we have among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country. Nobody knows that. And I am devastated to see it happening, but you see what’s going on in Europe again. They were always saying, “Oh, Europe is doing better.” Actually we did better, but now Europe has a big spike, a big spike. So they’re not talking about that. The number of hospitalized virus patients is down by 47% and virus patients coming to the emergency room is down and visits are way down, visits to hospital. Europe has almost a 50% greater excess mortality rate than the United States. They’re liking to compare us to Europe. 50% greater excess mortality rate. Our early and aggressive action saved millions of lives through Operation Warp Speed. You’ve heard about it, they don’t want to talk about it. What we’ve done in a record period of time with the ventilators, now we’re building ventilators for the world. Very hard to do. We’ll develop and distribute a vaccine very, very shortly in record time, it would have been two or three years, four years, if Biden’s group had done it, but we’ve done a great job with the FDA in clearing a path and you’ll be seeing it very shortly. And these are great companies that are doing it. So we’ll crush the virus and our opponents will, with him, they will crush America. We can’t let it happen. This country is too great. Our love of each other is too great. This guy doesn’t know he’s alive. He really doesn’t. He doesn’t know he’s alive. He did an ad on an anonymous source that said about me making a statement about military soldiers that died. And it was such a disgusting thing. I said, “The only good thing about it is now I can take the gloves off.” This guy doesn’t have a clue. He doesn’t know where the hell he is and they’ll give him a shot of something. I don’t know, he’s going to get something. Because I watched him so badly, he performed so badly in the debates, and then with Bernie, he was average, not great, but he got through and I said, “What the hell is he taking?” And we’d like to ask him. And I said that, “We want a drug test, we want a drug test. We’ll both take it. We’ll both take it.” Because with Bernie he was able to get through. But listen, it wasn’t Winston Churchill. This wasn’t the greatest, but he got through, it was fine. Him and Bernie screaming at each other, mostly Bernie. Crazy Bernie. He’s not too happy. I’ll tell you, did you ever see a better loser than Bernie though? Seriously. He’s a good loser. He got terribly treated by Hillary and that group. And then it happened again with Elizabeth Warren, right? It happened again. What the Democrat party did to him. And then you have this guy, Mike Bloomberg, mini Mike, one question and he was gone. There goes 1.8 billion out their window. I said, “You think it’s easy up here, Mike, don’t ya?” One question and that was the end. He said, “Where am I? Get me the hell off of this platform.” Mini Mike, mini Mike. So now he’s trying to buy into the party. You would think after the way they treated him, they called him every name, Pocahontas destroyed him, she didn’t do good against me, but boy did she do good against Mini Mike. I figured he’d be calling and saying, “Listen, I want to become a Republican.” We’ve done great for the economy, you’d think. But he always wanted to run for president, and he tried before, I guess, but he tried and it was a bad experience. And you would think he would have joined our party. But instead he’s trying to buy his way back in. When somebody treats you that way, even stay neutral, don’t go back in. He wants to give them a lot of money to try and buy their friendship. And one thing you learned about politics, I spent a fraction of the money that crooked Hillary spent. They raised $2 billion. I spent my own money, but I spent a fraction of the money, like 35%, 30%, and we won. Nobody ever says that. It’s not about money. It’s about other things. There are other things involved. It’s not just about money. In the old days, my father would teach me, “If you can win and spend less, that’s a good thing.” I remember after I won and I won decisively look, 306 to 223. That’s a lot. 306 delegates, 306, that’s decisive. We won Michigan and we’re going to win it again. We’re up in a poll just now. Oh, they’re going crazy. They’re going crazy. We won Wisconsin. We won Pennsylvania. But my father taught me. He said, “If you can win and spend less money, that’s a good thing, not a bad thing. That’s a good thing, not a bad thing.” Like if you get along with the leaders of other lands and don’t go to war all the time with everybody and can come out on top without having to shed blood all over the place and destroy your families and your country, like when I get along with Putin, when I get along with Kim Jong-un. Whatever happened to the war we were supposed to be in with North Korea? Nothing happened. They said I gave away so much. I said, “What did I give away?” They couldn’t find that anything. I didn’t do anything. They said, “You met.” “Oh, I met. Oh, okay. I met.” Now you would have been in war with her. You would have been in war. But if you can spend, think of this, if you can spend less money and win, that’s a good thing. So after I won one of these people back there, right back there-in order to keep the thing going on Trump, I had won, he said, “But Trump raised substantially less money than crooked Hillary Clinton.” That’s because I didn’t need the money. I didn’t need the money. I can call up a lot of rich guys that raised a lot of money, but I feel uncomfortable doing it because when you do that, it’s like you’re sort of … It’s not the same. I could call up every guy. They call me up and they say, “Sir, how are you, sir? Mr. President, sir.” I have friends see. I don’t have too many friends up because I used to be comfortable. You have to be comfortable with people, right? I have friends, I have one friend, Richard. I talk about him all the time, but multiply this times a hundred people. Richard used to call me up five, six years ago. “Hey, let’s have dinner.” “All right. Where do you want to go?” “I don’t know. Go to some crazy restaurant.” Today the restaurants are all closed in New York. They don’t want to open them. They want to make them do badly until November but don’t worry, they’re opening in November 4th. But it’s true. So, it’s Richard on the phone, Richard, my friend for many, many years. I said, “Hey Richard, how are you doing?” “Mr. President sir, how are you?” I said, “Well … ” He’s been calling Donnie and Don and DJ, and all. “Richard, are you okay? Everything good?” “Yes, sir. Mr. President, sir. You’re doing a great job and I’d like to thank you.” “Good, Richard. Richard, loosen up please. You don’t have to call me Mr. Parson.” I said, “Just call me Donald. It’s okay.” “Thank you Donald. I really appreciate it.” And you hear the guy can’t breathe. He’s having a hard time breathing. He’s very nervous. Then at the end of the phone, he goes, “Mr. President again, thank you so much for the job you do,” and he hangs up. I said, how can you be friends with … ? It just doesn’t work. It’s like, I’ve lost a lot of people this way. It’s called respect for the office. They have respect for the office. They really do. Nothing wrong with it. I sort of understand that. They have respect for the office. Nobody has more respect for this offices than I do. That’s why I’m doing a great job, and I’ll always do a great job. It’s respect for the office. But on November 3rd, Pennsylvania, will decide whether we end the pandemic, defeat the virus and return to record prosperity just like we were before, or whether we allow sleepy Joe Biden, who doesn’t have a clue, to kill the recovery, raise your taxes, delay the vaccine. So he wants to impose a $4 trillion tax. Do you believe? 4 trillion. Ban American energy, which means what? Hey, let’s go back. Let’s call up the Middle East and let’s be real nice to them because we need their energy. No, thank you. Destroy your suburbs. You know, I got rid of this regulation that was going to destroy your suburbs. Destroy your suburbs. I call it the Obama Regulates. They’re building nice projects right next to your beautiful home. Lots of luck. Give free healthcare. I hope the people in the suburbs … When I did this, I took a lot of heat. I got rid of a regulation. They all said, “Sir, we’ll amend the regulation. We’re going to amend it.” I said, “I don’t want to amend it.” A couple of stories where written. I wish the women living in the suburbs would read these stories. They were written by people that say, “I can’t believe a president had the guts to do it.” I did because I want to save the American dream. By the way, a big part of the American dream are minorities who made it and they want to live in the suburbs and they don’t want to be next to a project. So all you people in the suburbs that say, “I don’t know, I’m making up my mind.” Cory Booker was the one that was going to lead it out. He was going to be the one. He wants it to be … wants those projects to be nice and big. I just hope you’re going to remember that, sooner than November 3rd, because you can do it sooner, give free healthcare to illegal-So, the problem with free health care … We all have a heart, we all want to take care of people. The problem is when you promise free education, free healthcare, all this up and free healthcare. Remember sleepy Joe during the debate? “Who wants to give free healthcare to illegal immigrants?” Everybody immediately raises their hand, radical left, raises. Joe, do you remember? That’s a classic. He’s [inaudible 00:54:23]. Remember? Sleepy Joe. He’ll do it because he has no choice because they have total power. He’s like a puppet for them and indoctrinate your children with poisonous anti-American lies. To combat the toxic left wing propaganda in our schools, I announced last week that we are launching a new pro-American lesson plan for students called 1776 Commission. We will teach our children the truth about America, that we are the most exceptional nation on the face of the earth and getting better every single day. We’re not going to let it fail. The Democrat party has joined forces with flag burners, anarchists, anti-police people, they’re extremist. Agitators. And then they say, “Oh no, no, this was a peaceful protest. This is a peaceful protest.” They know what I’m talking about. They know our great uniform. Brilliant. We love them, but you know what? We call it a peaceful protest now, because the only thing you’re allowed to do in Pennsylvania, can’t go to church, right? You can’t meet, you can’t congregate. You can’t look at each other. You can’t give your wife a kiss goodnight. You’ve got to wear a mask. You can’t do anything. They got you closed up. “Don’t go out to dinner, stay where you are.” Michigan, same thing like the governor. Her husband went boating. It was a disaster because nobody’s allowed. He was the only boat. He had this massive, beautiful lake. You know the lake I’m talking about. It’s a big lake. Then the guy tried to put a boat. “Who is it?” “It’s the husband of the governor.” That didn’t work out too well for her. But the only thing you’re allowed to do is protest. They have a line. You can’t go to church. You can’t be with your neighbors, but if you’re going to protest and burn down stores, and loot stores and shoot people and step on people’s faces and do all sorts of bad things that these people will protect you from doing if they were given their rightful power and dignity. So they have a clause; stand up, fellows, stand up. They’ve got to be able to do their job. You’ve got to let them do their job. Got to be able to do your job, right? They let you do your job, you’d see. You’d see Pennsylvania, not some big, bad crime numbers in your state. You let them do your job. Any state, New York’s finest. By the way, I got endorsed by New York’s finest. First time they’ve ever endorsed. And you know that’s hard when you have radical left running the city, all politicians, the mayor. I got endorsed by the Chicago Police. Can you imagine that? I got endorsed by Oklahoma and I got endorsed by Texas and Louisiana. I got endorsed by Florida, the sheriffs. All the sheriffs got together, they endorsed Trump. I got endorsed by law enforcement, everybody. But how could you possibly endorse people that hate you and don’t respect the job you do, and don’t let you do your job most importantly? Because if they let you do what you do better than anybody else in the world, you wouldn’t have problems. These are other police departments. You look at Seattle. We said we’re going in, and they immediately said, “We’ll put up our hands.” It was so easy. We were going in the following day. You look at Portland. How about Portland? It’s like an anarchist’s dream. We’re dealing with the governor, because you know, I hate to say it, but they’re all Democrat-run cities and states. All of them, every single one. The Republicans are doing great, but they have to ask. By law, they have to ask us to go in. So, we did it in Minneapolis. You saw that, but it was too late. Was it like 10 days? The police are excellent, but they’re not allowed to do their job. Now, they wanted to defund the entire department. There’s not going to be anybody to protect you, and the people are starting to go wild. That’s why I’m going to win the state of Minnesota. I’m going to Minnesota. That’s-But do you remember that beautiful day? It was 10 days late. You had these people from CNN and other places. “These are friendly protests.” That’s a lovely thing to say. As he’s getting rocks and cans of tuna fish. They go out to buy tuna fish and soup. You know that, right? Goya. I hope Goya, he’s great, isn’t he? Good guy. They go out and buy Goya because they throw it. They throw it. It’s the perfect weight, tuna fish they can really rip it, and that hits you. No, it’s true. Bumblebee brand tuna, and you can throw it at soccer, you can a curve on it. You can do whatever else you want. The cops in Chicago, you saw, they’re going like this. It was terrible. They’re not allowed to fight back. They’re not allowed to fight back. These guys if they fight back, nobody’s going to be there very long throwing things. But they’re professionals, they’re anarchists. They’re paid for by outside stupid rich people that … They’re stupid people. By the way, you know the first ones that get wiped out? They don’t have a shot by the way, I’ll tell you that, but if they ever did, the first ones that would get wiped out are the stupid people that gave them the money to do this stuff. Those are the people that would get wiped out. But you know, they’re very smart. Everything is perfect. Do you ever see where they drop the bricks along the thing in a bag? Then they drop, everyone picks them up, throws them at our great police. We’re not going to let that stuff happen, but this is all a Democrat. It doesn’t happen with Republicans. I was with Greg Abbott. I was with Ron DeSantis, Texas and Florida and other governors that can’t even believe a thing like that could happen, but they get caught. They’re walking up. There’re like 30 cans of soup. They have like 25 cans of tuna. They get caught. “I’m bringing this home to my family. How dare you stop me?” No, no, no. They use it as ammunition. It’s terrible. So, we said to the governor, we said, “We want to go in and we want to take over Portland. It’ll take us literally a half hour, maybe less. We’ll march … ” And you saw a little dose of it. Minneapolis, the governor finally said, “Go in.” We have the National Guard. Remember that beautiful sight? The street was a mess. That idiot reporter from CNN got hit on the knee with a canister of tear gas, and he went down, “I’ve been hit. I’ve been in.” He’d been hit. The one with the shaved hair, shaved … Maybe I’ll do that one day. I’ll give it up [inaudible 01:01:47] shaven. But he went down and he didn’t like it. He was hit. “Police brutality.” You remember that? What these people would do, they’re throwing rocks and throwing everything they can at the police. Okay. Now the National Guard forums and we just saw the one guy come out in a black uniform. The uniform costs approximately $250,000. They got infrared stops. They got [inaudible 01:02:12]. They walked in, and they’ve got the tear gas. They’ve got everything you can possibly have. Pepper spray. They don’t want you to use tear gas anymore. In some places like I think in Milwaukee, they said no tear gas, no pepper spray. How the hell do you keep big crowds back? You can’t. So the police all quit. They all quit. They said, “We can’t do it.” But you remember, they went out and you had one, then you had two, three, four, then you had five, six, seven. All of a sudden they started pouring in. They were getting off the buses. They came from a different locale, and then you had a line of them and there was no social distancing unfortunately. In fact, I was going to turn them in because they were right next to each other. They were right next to each other. They were touching arms and they had big, strong arms like these guys right over here. There were big strong guys. That’s all right. They were like together. Then you saw the first line. Then you saw the second line, then you saw a third line, and then you saw a fourth line. Then they said, “March.” They never halted. Just walked right through, cleaned everything up, and Minneapolis was cured. They were cured. They grabbed them. They grabbed them. They grabbed them. They were grabbing them left and right. Sometimes they grabbed, they grabbed one guy, “I’m a reporter. I’m a reporter.” “Get out of here.” They throw him aside like he was a little bag of popcorn. But no, but I mean, honestly, when you watch the crap that we’ve all had to take so long, when you see that, it’s actually … You don’t want to do that, but when you see it, it’s actually a beautiful sight. It’s a beautiful sight. They had the same thing on some other streets and the whole thing was gone. I haven’t heard of any real problem in Minneapolis since that happened. I mean, they were just burning down the city and that idiot was standing there. “This is a friendly protest [inaudible 01:04:04].” Behind him was like 10 blocks of fire was … I’d never. It’s a classic. I don’t know. Anybody, you know what I’m talking about? Is it-So, I just have such respect, but you have to let these great professionals do what they do best. You have to let them do what they … It’s called law and order. We need law and order. So, Democrat phenomena. If they win, Sleepy Joe, if they win, because he has no power over these people, these people are crazed lunatics. If they win, your cities will be like this. You’ll lose all rights. Your constitution will be worthless. It’ll be a terrible, terrible thing. I’m not even sure that, after some time listening to that and going along with it, I’m not even sure the country can ever recover. That’s how bad it would be. I’m not sure it could ever recover. Over Labor Day. Left-wing radicals rampaged through Pittsburgh, harassing diners at restaurants. I saw that one. That was horrible. No, I saw that, right? I saw that. That one guy grabs a woman, a older woman, she’s eating a steak. He grabbed the steak and started eating it, then he threw it back on the plate. An outdoor place, and her husband standing there like they’re afraid for their lives. It was a terrible thing, and should never be allowed to happen. A thing like that should just be closed up before it ever gets started. That was terrible. Remember that? An older woman. Last week after a police officer shot a knife-wielding assailant, over 100 rioters rampaged in Lancaster. Went to school right nearby. Looting businesses, setting fires and assaulting police offices with rocks and bricks and glass. You saw that. Joe Biden has the support of violent left wing extremists. He never once mentioned the words law and order during their entire Democrat National Convention. Never once. They didn’t talk about the riots, they didn’t talk about anything having to do with law and order and respect and our great police. They didn’t do it. They didn’t talk about it. It’s not a subject. They will rip your cities apart and they will go to your suburbs for all of those people in the suburbs that are ready to go about, they will go to your suburbs next. I have the support of America’s law enforcement heroes. I was recently honored to be endorsed by the largest group of police and police representatives in the country. We’re endorsed by everybody. We’re joined by Butler County Mike Slupe. Thank you, Mike, as well as two sheriffs who just changed their registrations, oh that’s nice, to become Republicans. They were long time Democrats. Who are those two showers? Wow. Thank you. It’s Fayette County Sheriff James Custer and Forest County Sheriff, Bob Wolfgang. Where’s Bob? Stand up, fellows. Thank you. Were you long time Democrats? How the hell did that happen? Well, this is somewhat of a phenomena. This is somewhat … This is crazy what’s going on now. It can be stopped so easily, and you guys know exactly what I’m talking about. Thank you very much. It’s an honor to have you in the party. Thank you. That’s great. There’s a whole great group of sheriffs and law enforcement here. Also, with us, our Congressman Guy Russian Reschenthaler. Guy. Where’s Guy? Great warrior. Where are they sitting? And a friend of mine and a warrior. He’s a warrior. He’s tough as hell. They said, “We want to impeach the president for making a perfect phone call.” Oh, did you hear today? They want to impeach me again. They said, if I submit the name of one of the most talented people in the world to be a justice of the Supreme Court, they want to impeach me. They want to impeach me if I’m following the constitution. No, think of it. This is crazy Nancy. These people are stonecold crazy. Think of it. I got impeached for making a perfect phone call. Perfect phone call. Everybody read it. Nobody to this day … and the Republicans stuck together. It was great. Also, a friend of mine and he wanted to just rip them apart, I remember when he heard about it. He’s a rough guy and he’s a popular guy too. They love him. Congressman Mike Kelly. Thank you, Mike. Come on up here. Come on up here. Just come up. Come on up. Mike, come up. Come on. Guy, come up. Congressmen Glenn Thompson, Congressman Dan Muser, come on. And Congressman Scott Perry. Thank you, Mike. Hey Mike, good shape. Come on, get up there. Oh what a group. What a group. Thank you. Thank you. We also have a candidate here for Congress. This is a candidate who is the real deal. He is tough as hell. He’s no lamb, no lamb. I don’t know if you can get over that, but this guy could get over there and rip it apart of [inaudible 01:10:00]. They have big security over here. That’s okay. Secret Service. That’s okay. Come on up here. Sean Parnell, who has my complete and total endorsement. He's the real deal. Conor lamb is just a puppet for Nancy Pelosi and crying Chuck Schumer. You know crying Chuck? He cries every time he thinks it’s appropriate. Now, I’ll tell you what. This Conor lamb turned out to be a stonecold phony. When he was running … It’s a very Trump … they like me. I thought he was a Republican because his ads were so good. “We have to respect our president. We have … ” I said, “This guy’s doing some beautiful ads,” and then I found out he was a Democrat. I’ll tell you what. He’s nothing compared to Sean. Sean is the real deal. Thank you so much. Just give a little hand, because he’s done a hell of a job too. Our campaign chair, Bernie Comfort. Thank you, Bernie. Bernie Comfort. Thank you. Thank you to Bernie Comfort. Thanks, Bern. All right. While you guys are standing behind me like a beautiful curtain there … Well they’re not blocking Air Force One so we could … But I have a woman with us tonight who has devoted so much. She gave up her business. She said, “Dad, I’m going to come to Washington and help you. I love you daddy, and we’re going to help people. I don’t care and … ” She was very successful in every way, and it’s my daughter Ivanka. I just want to thank this group of people. And a man that helped, we just negotiated a major peace deal in the Middle East. Everyone said it was impossible. You know that, right? They said it’s impossible. They’ve been killing everybody for years and years, they had this guy, John Kerry, who’s grossly incompetent. They paid $150 billion to Iran, they paid 1.8 billion in cash. That’s even more impressive, frankly, in cash, that’s John Kerry. And we just made a deal with Bahrain and UAE, United Arab Emirates, and Israel, and it’s a great thing. And the man right there, Jared, the abuse, the abuse he takes, but he did something that nobody’s been able to do, and he wants none of the glory, he’d rather not come up here. These guys will come up 100%. Jared, great deal, great job. Incredible. Everyone’s talking about it. We have plenty of other countries going to join and there’s no blood in the sand. Okay. Thanks honey. Thank you. Great people. Thank you, Sean. Thank you, Sean. We have spent the last four years reversing the damage that Joe Biden inflicted over the last 40. They like Sean. Sean, will you please win? Sean Parnell. I’ll tell you, he’s popular. That’s great, Sean. We love Sean. But Biden championed every globalist portrayal of Pennsylvania for half a century, he was a cheerleader for the worst trade deal ever made by any country, NAFTA and China’s entry into the world trade organization, which built China like a rocket ship. They were flat lined for many, many decades and then right through the roof, that was a Biden approval. These disasters ripped out one third of your state’s manufacturing jobs. You know what happened. Biden shouldn’t be asking for your vote, he should be begging for your forgiveness. He did a terrible job. Now the Democrat party is pledging to rejoin the disastrous Paris Climate Accord. You want to spend a lot of money for nothing? Eviscerating your state’s economy, you will spend a trillion dollars and what it is really, it takes away your power, it takes away your energy. You’ll be closing your plants and factories all over the place. I withdrew from it. And you know what, the people that understand, the smart people, they said, “I can’t believe you had the guts to do it.” And I figured I was going to be absolutely killed on this one. And you know what, I’m so proud I did it and people get it. It was a rip off of the United States. I withdrew from the catastrophe because I was elected to fight for Pittsburgh, not for Paris. This election is a choice between Pennsylvania and China, if Biden wins, China wins. When we win, Pennsylvania wins and America wins. For decades, our politicians spent trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign wars that never ended and defending foreign borders. But now we’re finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities and we are bringing our jobs, our factories, and our troops, back home in the USA where they belong. All coming home. During the pandemic, I’ve suspended the entry of foreign workers who threatened American jobs. As our economy reopens, I want to ensure that Americans are first in line to get the great jobs and the high wages. America first. Biden wants to flood the economy with cheap labor to replace US workers. You know that. And that’s why never, never, I see his say, hire American. He got it for me, all the words he’s got there, are my words, right? Do you ever see it? They say he copied my campaign. I keep saying, what the hell happened for 47 years and now he’s copying my campaign. As president … and you know it’s not going to happen with him, as president, I know my first duty is always to take care of you, the American worker. That’s what we’re taking care of. Under my administration, we’ve achieved the most secure border in US history and we are finishing that wall, it’s going to be done so fast. It’s got to be done so fast. Since 2017 ICE has successfully arrested nearly a half a million illegal aliens with criminal records, including over 145,000 assaults, 40,000 sex offenses and 5,000 murderers. If you don’t mind, Democrats will bring them the hell out of our country, we’ll get them out of here. Some of them are so violent, we have to keep them. We don’t want to house them for 50 years, but if we let them go, they come back in, as much as we watch. If they come back in, we don’t want it, we don’t want them. So we keep them here, we have no choice. If the left gains power, they will abolish … Republicans will always … they’re going to abolish. Republicans will always stand with these incredible heroes of ICE and border patrol. You have to see these ICE people. They go into a den of MS13, and they call them a den, a nest, where you have these guys that are vicious, vicious gang members. And they go in there, they just start swinging. It’s the craziest thing, they love it. Now, who wants that job? Do you want that job? Look, he’s a tough guy sitting here, you too, you’re tough guys, you don’t want any part of it. They’re just incredible and they love our country. They love our country. And then people say, ” Oh, they’re too rough. They’re too rough.” You have no idea how bad some of these gangs are and what they do. They use knives because it’s more painful. They cut people up. They cut two young, beautiful girls, 16 years old. They were going home from school and they cut them to pieces, killed them, they’re animals. We invested $2.5 trillion in the US military and launched the first new branch of the US armed forces in 75 years, space force. Not since the air force. Think of it, the air force was last. If I did just that, space force big deal, by the way, it’s going to end up being one of the most important things you’ve ever imagined. But if I just did that, a sixth branch of the US military, that would be a big deal. That’s like one of many, many things. We passed VA choice and VA accountability. We killed the founder and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi, they were after him for a year. We took out the world’s number one terrorist and the mass murderer of American troops and many others. Qasem Soleimani is gone. I withdrew from the last administration’s disastrous Iran nuclear deal, one of the great disasters. And by the way, it’s practically expired. The crazy deal that Obama made practically expired. And his chief negotiator, he never left. ” I want this.” “Nope. We’re not giving to you.” “Okay, let’s go on to the next one. Give me this.” “Nope.” “Give me this.” “Nope.” “Give me this.” “Nope.” He never won a point, he lost everything. It’s the worst deal I’ve ever seen. And the only time he left the table is to go on a bicycle ride and he crashed and broke his leg and his arm. And I promised everybody I would never go riding in a bicycle race. I swear to you. I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. That was a 52 year development that I got done in about a day. They’d been negotiating that sovereignty over the Golan Heights, I got it done immediately. 52 years, they worked on that. But instead of endless war, we are forging peace in the Middle East. It’s so great. Peace in the Middle East. So Biden’s put forward a platform that would end America as we know it. And this is true. I don’t think of him as a radical lefty, but basically he’s controlled by them. And what about this Kamala? How about her? She at 15%, no, she’s at 13%. Then people started … no she’s at 12. No, she’s at 10. She’s at nine, she’s at seven. These are a poll numbers. She got worse than worse. She quit before she ever got to Iowa. Plus nobody, including Pocahontas, treated Biden so badly. Called him a racist, brought him into the me too movement, made him a member of the me too movement. The things she said. And I brilliantly said, “Well, the one person he can choose is Kamala.” “Ladies and gentlemen, I’d like to pick Kamala,” and she’s rated more liberal than Bernie. You know what, he’s number two. Believe it or not. You know, it’s a true story. She is rated the most liberal person in Congress. And I think she’s grossly incompetent, I’ll be honest with you. I don’t think she knows what [inaudible 01:22:50]. We have a great vice president, Mike Pence. He’s great and he says hello. If elected, Biden would destroy social security and destroy protections for preexisting conditions, people with preexisting conditions, drain your Medicare by giving away your healthcare to illegal immigrants. They’re all going to come in. If you have that, the problem is we’re going to give you healthcare, they’re going to all pour into the United States and our country can’t afford it. We want to be nice, we all have hearts, country can’t afford it. They would get people that never even thought of coming if they see that. Can’t do it. They would end our travel bans on jihadist regions. We have very strong … remember I got travel bans. Everyone thought it was such a terrible thing, such a terrible person. He’s such a terrible person. I’m such a bad guy, I got travel bans. And increase refugee admissions by more than 700%, opening the flood gates to radical Islamic terrorism. Ban school choice and all charter schools, they’re very important. In the second term, I will provide school choice to every parent in America. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans. All Americans, race, color, creed, all Americans. So in conclusion, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we will end our reliance on China, once and for all. We will make our medical supplies right here in the United States, right here in Pennsylvania. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults or law enforcement and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. We’d ban them. We will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. Thank you. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens and we will keep America out of endless, ridiculous, stupid foreign wars. We losing our youth to countries that you’d never even heard of, right? Never even heard of them. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. We will surprise, think of the surprise medical billing, we’re going to end it, surprise. You ever walk into a hospital, oh, gee, fix you up. Oh, great. Then you get a bill for $2,000 for a band-aid. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency, which I’ve already signed and brilliantly starts on January 1st. Hey, you better vote for me. You know, I think that’s, in a way, bigger than healthcare. Can you imagine Biden if he won? Price transparency is so big, it’s all done, it starts on January 1st. How smart is that? How smart. And you’re going to see numbers and reductions like you’ve never seen. Could you imagine if he were president, “Sir, our medical costs have dropped in half price. Transparency has been unbelievable.” “What is that? What is price transparency?” And they’ll explain it to him. He still won’t have a clue. But can you imagine giving him credit? I signed it, it’s all done. It starts on January 1st. I say, “Why can’t you start it now, just in case?” And know what they said, “Sir, statutorily, it has to start then.” I said, “All right, let’s go.” But I know we’re going to win, so it’s not going to matter. And we’re going to further reduce health insurance premiums and the cost of prescription drugs. We have a favored nations laws, well now we get the same price as all these nations that are paying a tiny fraction, which should have been instituted a long time ago. And the drug companies are going after me with those ads. Oh, it’s terrible, terrible. You know why? Just every time you see an add from the drug company, they got plenty of money, that’s why nobody ever fights them. Anytime you see an ad from a drug company, just remember one thing, your drug prices are coming down. That’s what it means. That’s what it means. We will strongly protect Medicare and social security and we will always protect patients. We will protect every single patient. America will land, by the way, the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. You know, NASA was an absolute disaster, grass was growing through the fairways too. They had fairways, that’s about all they use, were the fairways. And now we have something, right through the runways, the landing strips, it was all grass infested, it was all weed infested, and now it’s the number one space center in the world, by far. It was a closed up mess. And we have rich guys sending up rockets, Elon and others. They send up rockets and we say, let them keep going. Let them keep spending money on these rockets. They love rockets. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words in our national motto, in God, we trust. For years you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the people of Pennsylvania, like nobody has ever stood up before. So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors and your coworkers, and get out and vote. And early voting, if you didn’t know it, has already begun and watch it and watch those fake ballots, you got to go out and turn them in. If you see somebody cheating, you got to turn them in, from Erie … and you probably will, it’s going to be a mess, watch this. But get out and vote early. From Erie to Eastern, from Altoona to Scranton, from Harrisburg to right here in Pittsburgh. Say hello to big Ben. We stand on the shoulders of Pennsylvania patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for their beloved country. This is the state where our founding fathers declared American independence, right? This is the state. Such history, such history. It’s where the army, weathered it’s brutal winter at Valley Forge, I know it well. Where George Washington led his men on a daring mission across the Delaware and where our union was saved by the heroes of Gettysburg. Gettysburg, one of the great, great, incredible sights of history, Gettysburg. So vicious, so horrible and yet so beautiful and so historic, right? Incredible. Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. This is the place where generations of tough, strong Pennsylvania workers, mine the coal, work the railroads, forge the steel that made America into the greatest and most powerful nation in the history of the world. And we are making it greater, greater, greater than ever before. Not even close, not even close, it’s what we’re doing, we’re doing it together. Proud citizens like you, helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people, with your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of Pennsylvania, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you, Pennsylvania. Thank you.
















"
"67","09-23-20","Hello. Thank you very much. Thank you. Today, Johnson & Johnson announced that their vaccine candidate has reached the final stage of clinical trials. This is record time. This is the fourth vaccine candidate in the United States to reach the final stage of trial. So we have four candidates already at a very late date, late being a very positive word in this case. Earlier this year, Johnson & Johnson anticipated that they would reach phase one trials by September, but due to our support under Operation Warp Speed and to some of the incredible scientists involved, they’ve reached phase three trials by September, far ahead of schedule. We encourage Americans to enroll in the vaccine trial. It’s not only interesting, it’ll be a terrific thing for our country. We encourage everybody to enroll, as many people as we can. Today, my administration announced that we are awarding $200 million of CARES Act funding to all 50 states to prepare to distribute the vaccine to high-risk residents. And we want to do that the instant it is approved, not the following day, but the following moment. So we’re going to be doing that, and we’ll be getting it ready because we have some great vaccines going to be coming out through Operation Warp Speed. We also continue to accelerate life-saving therapies. We’re seeing promising results that are monoclonal antibody treatments, which help the immune system fight the virus and help very significantly, we’re finding, can reduce hospitalizations now by more than 70%. By cutting red tape and unleashing America’s medical genius, we’ve reduced the fatality rate 85% since April. For individuals under 50, they have a 99.98% rate of survival from the China virus. That’s a number that’s been really increasing substantially with time. As children go back to school, we’re encouraged that early research shows only a small degree of spread. Brown University conducted a study of more than 550 schools across 46 states and found that only 0.076% of students had confirmed cases of the virus. That’s a tiny percentage. And only 0.15% of teachers had confirmed cases. Patients coming to the emergency room due to the virus is down to only 1.6% of all emergency room visits, the lowest since the pandemic began. 1.6% emergency room visits. As far as protecting the vulnerable is concerned, we provided over $21 billion to our nursing homes, and we are really focused on the nursing homes, everybody and including our governors. Governors are working very closely with the task force and with the vice-president and everybody involved. We’ve sent rapid testing devices to nearly 14,000 certified nursing homes in the country. This week, we’re sending hundreds of thousands of additional rapid tests to nursing homes to ensure that they can test staff regularly. And the staff now is being tested on a regular basis, but very strongly at the finest level, the highest level and the best tests. We’re encouraged at the number of Americans getting the flu vaccine is increasing by roughly 50% compared to last year, substantially up. The flu, when it’s mixed with COVID or China virus, is going to be very interesting to see what happens, but that can drive numbers. And we just don’t know what that will be yet, but you’ll have flu numbers and you’ll have some COVID numbers. I think we’re rounding the turn very much. You see what’s happening in Europe. However, they have a very big spike. Countries that we thought were doing well aren’t doing well. They had some very big spikes. A very big surge. Months ago, we increased our nation’s procurement of the flu vaccine by 66% and we ask Americans to go get their annual flu shot as early as possible. It’s possible, I would imagine, Scott, that the flu can get mixed up with the virus and people can think it’s the virus when actually it’s another flu season coming on. I don’t know, I hope they can keep them separate. Can they keep them separate? I doubt they will. It’s going to be a very interesting time, but we have a flu season coming up. We’ve had some flu seasons which are really massive over the years, over many years and we have some that are much less so, but it’s still significant. So I hope they can separate them because it’s pretty close. In the past four months, we’ve created 10.6 million jobs. We cut unemployment rate nearly in half. The unemployment rate is cut nearly in half. Larry Kudlow is here. He’ll be discussing that in a little while. Retail sales are up 121%. That’s far above what we thought. Manufacturing is up 61%. That’s also above our schedule and our schedule is a heavy schedule. Automobile production is up six fold. Homebuilders’ sentiment is at the highest level in history. That’s an amazing statement, Larry, the highest level in history. That means people are thinking good thoughts. Home sales are at the highest level in nearly 15 years. Small business optimism is higher than any time under the last administration, substantially higher, small business optimism higher than at any time, more than the last administration. Today, I was proud to award nine companies and organizations with the first ever Pledge to America’s Workers presidential award. This award recognizes outstanding training programs that are giving Americans the skills to hone a trade and earn a great living with great people. Over 400 companies have competed and committed to 16 million training opportunities for the American worker. And it’s really been amazing. We’ve created the fastest economic recovery in American history. You are witnessing it, you’re part of it. Our approach is pro-science, Biden’s approach is anti-science if you look. I don’t think they know what their approach is, although a lot of it is copied from what we’ve done. Biden opposed the China travel ban and the Europe travel ban. And the strategy that they have is just never ending lockdowns. We’re not locking down, We’re actually growing at a rate that we’ve never experienced before, but they’re talking about, “If you have a question, just lock it down.” We’re not doing that. You can’t do that. Our plan will crush the virus. Actually, Biden’s plan will crush America, if you think about it. You can’t lock down. Again, we’re growing at levels that nobody’s ever seen before. Our plan is unleashing a rapid recovery, our opponents plan would hurt America very badly, send us into a depression. And with all of that being said, we are going to be having a very exciting Saturday at five o’clock in the Rose garden where I’ll be putting forth my nominee for Supreme Court justice. I think it will be a great nominee, a brilliant nominee. As you know, it’s a woman. We’ve brought it down to five women. It’s time for a woman to be chosen with everything that’s happened. And with Justice Ginsburg’s passing, we are going to go sometime tomorrow morning, as I understand it, to pay our respects and we’ll be over there. I guess they’d probably put that announcement down, but that’ll be done tomorrow morning. The vice-president was there today. And so if you have any questions, we’ll take a few questions. Well, we’re going to have to see what happens. You know that I’ve been complaining very strongly about the ballots. And the ballots are a disaster. We want to have… Get rid of the ballots and we’ll have a very peaceful… There won’t be a transfer frankly, there’ll be a continuation. The ballots are out of control. You know it, and you know who knows it better than anybody else? The Democrats know it better than anybody else. Please. Go ahead. I cannot hear you through your mask. She is on my list. I don’t have a meeting planned, but she is on my list. [crosstalk 00:10:11] talk about the meetings planned. I speak to people, I talk to people, but I don’t have a meeting plan, no. I didn't know that. No. Yes. Well I thought it was… Really brilliant Kentucky attorney general, Daniel Cameron, is doing a fantastic job. I think he’s a star. And he made a statement that I’ll just read. “Justice is not often easy. It does not fit the mold of public opinion. And it does not conform to shifting standards. It answers only to the facts and to the law. If we simply act on emotion or outrage, there is no justice. Mob justice is not justice. Justice sought by violence is not justice. It just becomes revenge.” I mean, I heard that. I said, “Write that down for me please because I think it was a terrific statement.” He’s handling it very well. You know who he is. I think you know, I think everyone now knows who he is. I will be speaking to the governor. And we have a call scheduled to make very shortly, with the governor. I understand he’s called up the national guard, which is a good thing. I think it’s a very positive thing. And it’ll all work out. Good candidate. I can’t tell you what’s going to happen with the Democrats. I can say this, the person that I will be putting up and I won’t say that I’ve even chosen that person yet. I could say any one of the five, they’re outstanding women. But the person I’ll be putting up is highly qualified. Totally brilliant. Top of the line, academic student, the highest credentials. All of them have that. But the highest credentials. And you’ll see on Saturday who that is. I can’t imagine why a Democrat wouldn’t vote for this person. On you. Yeah, please go ahead. Not you, you right here. I’m not a fan of hers. And I would say this and she probably has heard that, but I wish a lot of luck to Harry because he’s going to need it. Well, I tell you what, we’re looking at that. That has to be approved by the White House. We may or may not approve it. That sounds like a political move. Because when you have Pfizer, Johnson and Johnson, Moderna, these great companies coming up with the vaccines and they’ve done testing and everything else. I’m saying, why would they have to be adding great length to the process. We want to have people not get sick. The vaccine is very important. It’s the final step. I believe it’s going to be the final step. And no, we’re looking at that. But I think that was a political move more than anything else. Well, I have tremendous trust in these massive companies that are so brilliantly organized, in terms of what they’ve been doing with the tests. I mean, I don’t know that a government, as big as we are, could do tests like this. We’ve made it possible for them to do the tests in rapid fashion. But when they come back and they say that we have something that works and absolutely works. And they’re coming back with great numbers and statistics and tests and everything else that they have to come back with, I don’t see any reason why should be delayed further. Because if they delay it a week or two weeks or three weeks, that’s a lot of lives you’re talking about. Scott, would you agree with that? How do you feel about that? It sounded to me, extremely political. Why would they do this, when we come back with these great results. And I think you will have those great results. Why would we be delaying it? But we’re going to look at it. We’re going to take a look at it. And ultimately the White House has to approve it. And maybe we will and maybe we won’t, but we’ll be taking a look. I have to leave for an emergency phone call. I’m going to let Scott and Larry finish up. I’ll be back. I will see you tomorrow. 
















"
"68","09-24-20","Hello, Jacksonville. We love Jacksonville. We love Jacksonville. I’m thrilled to be back in my home state of Florida with thousands of loyal, hardworking American patriots. This is some crowd. I just wish the cameras would show the crowd. They don’t want to do that. They don’t like to do that. It’s harder for us to win because we have a fake news back there, but somehow we just keep on doing it. Isn’t it crazy? Isn’t it crazy? It’s interesting, when Biden comes to Florida, he’ll have 12, 13 people. You know they do the circles and he has a hard time filling up the circles. Here, we probably have 30,000 people or something. That’s a lot of people. That’s a lot of people. Well, I want to thank you. Forty days from now, we’re going to win Florida. We’re going to win four more years in the White House. And this is the most important election in the history of our country, I believe that. It is because we’re dealing with people that are crazy. They’re going to raise your taxes. They’re going to take away your second amendment, you know that. Your second amendment is not going anywhere with me, I can tell you that. The Democrat party has been completely taken over by socialists, Marxists and far left extremists. They embrace the policies of Communist Cuba, Socialist Venezuela. They want to end the American dream for Hispanic-Americans. We love Hispanic-Americans well. Did you see, they released a poll today? They said Trump’s doing really well. What’s going on with the Hispanic? It took you so long to figure out that I love you. How long did it take? No more of that stuff. No, the Hispanic-Americans are great. And they did, they released a poll today and nobody’s ever seen anything like it. The Republicans are beating the Democrats with Hispanic-Americans. No, we’re doing great. We’re doing great. And they never like to show those polls. Whenever you see, they don’t show too many polls, that’s only because we’re winning. We’re winning by a lot. We think we’re winning by a lot. But the only poll that counts is on November 3rd, right? That’s the only poll that counts. So get out there, don’t let them bluff you. Whatever it is, get out there and vote. The Republican party is the party of job, safety and freedom and we will ensure that America never becomes a Socialist or Communist country. I’ve added that recently. I said, “Socialist country.” I said, “Now a Socialist or Communist country,” because these people are crazy. Kamala, Kamala is further left than Bernie. I didn’t know that. She is the furthest left in the U.S. Senate. She was up at 15% when she started, you know that right, that story? She went down to 14, then she went to 12, then she went to 11. She went to nine and eight, six, four, two, one and then she left before Iowa, the great state of Iowa, where I made ethanol possible for them, ethanol. And I gave our farmers $28 billion, thank you very much, China. We took it out of China because they were targeting Iowa, Nebraska, a lot of our great States, Wisconsin. We gave our farmers a lot of money. Some came down to farmers down in Florida. They don’t know that. We’ve got a lot of farmers in Florida. But here’s the choice facing every Florida vote, Joe Biden will deliver a crippling shutdown. He’s actually thinking about… No, we did that and we saved millions of lives. That’s it? We’re doing good now. And by the way, your governor’s done a great job. Florida is down, low down with the China virus, it’s China virus. Some people call it coronavirus. That sounds like a beautiful place in Italy, right? No, it didn’t come from Italy. It came from China. But this guy’s talking, he’ll shut it down. If the scientists say shut it down, he’ll shut it down. No, we’re not shutting anything down. We are doing so well. You look at our numbers. Wait until you see the third quarter. I shouldn’t say it because back there, but wait until you see how good the third quarter is going to be, and it comes out just before the election, so I’m taking a risk when I say it. You won’t believe the numbers you say. I tell you, you’re going to see numbers, nobody’s going to believe those numbers. We’re hearing from 25 to a 35% GDP. Nobody’s ever heard of that. Well, Iran has a 25% GDP too, but it’s a negative GDP of 25. They just announced negative 25. They don’t like me too much. Be careful. Be careful. I’m delivering a safe vaccine and we’re doing a record recovery. This recovery is a record. They’ve never seen anything like it. And next year is going to be, I think, the best economic year in the history of our country, unless a very sleepy guy got in and he decided to quadruple everybody taxes. Then you can forget it. He’s a sleepy guy. Did you see he did a lid this morning? Again, lid, lid. You know what a lid is? A lid is when you put out word you’re not going to be campaigning today. So he does the lid all the time. I’m working my ass off. I’m in Texas. I’m in Ohio. I’m in North Carolina, South Carolina. I’m in Michigan. I’m all over the place, Wisconsin. Thank you, thank you. But he puts a lid on. So a lid, I didn’t know what the hell I lid was. I’ve only been doing this for three and a half years. Right? But a lid is you’re not going to go out today. You’re going to stay in your apartment, or let’s put it this way, in his basement. So early in the morning, he’s put a lid on. That means nothing for the… I guess they do that for the press. The fake news goes home and they say how great he is as a candidate. They go home and they say, “He’s a great candidate,” but he put another lid, many lids. So he did a lid today, early in the morning, that he won’t be working today. And I don’t know, I’m working so hard. Maybe he’s right. Think of it. Supposing he never campaigns and he wins. You know how badly I’m going to feel? I’m working hard and you’ve got to work hard. And you know what? I said it today, we cannot have a low energy individual as our president. We can’t. And he’s the lowest energy individual I’ve ever seen. I’ve ever seen. So we’ll see what happens, but he’s lidding up. Maybe he’s going to be great at the debate. He’s been doing it for 47 years. Somebody said, “Oh, he won’t do well at the debate.” I said, “I think you’re wrong. He’ll do fine. He’s going to do fine.” They’ll give him a big shot or something and he’ll go out there. He’ll have a lot of energy. He’ll have energy. He’ll be like Superman for about 15 minutes. Biden’s plan will crush Florida. My plan will crush the virus and we’re doing it. We’re rounding the third. We’re rounding the turn. Under my leadership, prosperity will surge. Normal life, oh I love normal life. We want to get back to normal life. We’ll fully resume. The Florida tourism and hospitality industries will reach record highs. That’s what’s going to happen, you see it. And next year will be one of the greatest years. We are going to have… I’m telling you, mark it down and if I’m wrong, you’ll say I was wrong. I’ll say, “Sorry about that.” But we’re going to have a great year. We’re going to have a great everything. Our country is doing great. Our military has never been stronger. We’ve taken out so many bad ones. Hopefully it’s so strong that we’ll never have to use it. You understand that? You’ll want to make it so strong. We’ve never had weapons like this. No country in the world ever possessed the power, the weaponry. What we have is so incredible. Nobody’s ever possessed it before, not Russia, not China, not anybody. We’re the envy of the world. Hope to God, we never have to use them. That’s all I can tell you. This election is about jobs. By the way, speaking of jobs, it’s all made in the USA everything we have. This election is also about law and order. You know, they said, “Oh, don’t say law and order. That’s too tough a term.” They say, “Sir, say law and order very lightly.” Then say, ” And safety and liberty and this.” I said, “No, no, it’s about law and order.” We have to have law and order, right? These Democrat run states are a disaster. They’re a disaster. You look at what’s happening all over the country and many of them, look at Portland. How bad is that? I mean, how bad is that? I will say last night in Kentucky, I spoke to the governor. He’s a Democrat. We had a great talk and he pulled out his national guard, and he’s doing it good. I gave him credit. I give him credit, but mostly they don’t want to do that. I say, “Let us send the national guard.” I did it in, you remember? Minnesota. We’re going to win Minnesota. So, I did it in Minneapolis. Minnesota, they were having a hard time. It took a little long, a little longer than we wanted, but we got the okay to get in. We solved that problem in about 25 minutes, I think it took. They formed a line. That was the hard part. The easy part was just walking straight ahead. They never flinched. They were not socially distanced. They were right next to each other. They had $250,000 piece uniforms. They had more stuff in their head. I’m trying to figure out what is it. They had computers. They had infrared goggles. They had everything. They walk forward with their canisters of tear gas and pepper spray. It was, remembered the CNN reporter? He went down. He got hit on the knee with a can of, what? Yeah, that’s right, he got hit. He said, “I’m down. I’m down.” He was down. Still bad. I felt badly for him though. He went down, Ali Velshi. Remember, he was standing and he was saying, “This is a friendly protest. It’s wonderful to see the lovely people that are here.” He’s ducking and behind him, the entire city was burning down. Do you remember that? The entire city. Why are they doing that? What’s the purpose of it? I don’t get it. I don’t get it. But no, he got hit on the knee with a canister of tear gas. They say it hurts, hurts. That’s only going 52 miles an hour. A bullet goes about 2,000 miles an hour, but they say it hurts. But they cleaned out that city in half an hour. They had no problem. Minneapolis, that’s one of the reasons I’m going to win. Another reason would be Ilhan Omar. That’s a reason. Omar, we’re going to win because of Omar. That’s a beauty. That’s really, she’s great. She’s great. She loves our country very much. She has a total disrespect for our country, and I think she has hatred for our country, but I would say Omar is a big reason that we’re going to win. They’re not too fond of her in Minnesota. I’ll always fight for the right of all citizens to live in security and peace, so we have law and order. Joe Biden is weak as hell. He surrendered his party to flag burners, riders and anti- police radicals, the Democrat party’s war on police. A lot of people say cops, I never liked the word. My father, sit down, please. Come on, won’t be here for awhile. What the hell. [inaudible 00:24:42] We have nothing else to do. I have nothing else to do except run a country. The hardest part about running the country is dealing with crazy Democrats. We’re working on stimulus for people, because it’s not their fault. It was China’s fault that we can’t get Nancy Pelosi to approve it. She wants to wait until after the election. I said, “People want their money now. Not going to have any impact from that standpoint, people want their money now.” The Democrat party’s war on cops is putting the lives of innocent police officers in danger, but my father had great respect, always had great respect for law enforcement, for the police. One time, I said, “Dad, the cops are out there. Look at that, they look great.” He says, “Never use the word cops. It’s police.” That’s the kind of respect he had. He thought, I don’t want to, you know? Right. Look, I have this couple of pretty rough looking guy. No, it’s true. So, I always find it a little hard. I just left an impression, this police. He thought it was slang. I don’t think they mind. I don’t think … How many? We got a lot of them here. Does anybody mind the term cops? Who’s here that’s a police man or woman, policeman? Do they mind? A lot of them. A lot of them. Do they mind that term cops? No. They just want respect and they just want to be allowed to do their job properly as nobody can do it. You agree with that? That’s what I say. All right. Now start calling them cops. Respect us and let us do our job. Earlier this month, two sheriff’s deputies were ambushed at close range in Los Angeles, California. I called them both and they’re okay, but they were hit. They were hit bad. Last night, as you know, two police officers were shot in Louisville, Kentucky. Every year, dozens of courageous police officers lay down their lives for people that they never met, people that they don’t know, people they never saw in most cases, right? They laid down their lives for people they never met. They’re incredible. Law enforcement, let’s give them a hand, please. Thank you very much. That’s good. I tell them all the time, we have endorsements from all of them, but I tell them all the time, you have no idea how much you’re loved. They don’t hear it because they watch the fake news at night, and you don’t get the truth. So, that’s a lot of people back there. That’s a lot of fakers back. Look at all those red lights. The red light means you’re on live. The problem with being on live, you make a little bit of a mistake and they say, “This was a horrible evening.” All right. Thank you. That’s enough. That’s enough of it. No, it’s very dishonest. It’s a shame. Really does hurt our country. It’s so fake. They don’t show the protesters. They don’t show it. When you think that like cities are burning down and storefronts are being exploded, people are being killed, they would have you believe there’s nothing happening. It’s the most incredible thing. I don’t even understand why. No matter what your philosophy is, no matter where you stand, why wouldn’t you want to show the facts, show what’s happening? Then we fix it. The Republican cities don’t have trouble. The Republican states, they don’t have trouble. You go to different states, they don’t know … They find it, some of these governors, friends of mine, and I have friends on both sides, but Republican governors, red states, they look like, how is a thing like this possible? Because they have law and order. They have law and order for this. That’s what it is. For the entire summer, Joe Biden was silent as his far left supporters assaulted police officers, harassed innocent Americans and set fire to buildings. There were rioters. There were looters. They were anarchists. He called them peaceful protesters. He said they’re peaceful protesters. Joe, they’re not peaceful. Now, maybe he may believe it. I mean, honestly, they may say they’re peaceful. Okay, I’ll say they’re peace. I think he believes it. I actually do. It’s the other ones that you have to worry about, because they call the shots, not him. He’s called for the ridiculous cutting of police funding, abolishing cash bail, if you can believe that and the closing of our prisons. They want to close up prisons. That’s a good idea. He even described law enforcement as the enemy. He said law enforcement is the enemy. Now, I assume, I’ll ask the fake news. Has he taken it back? I assume, because he’s taken everything back. He’s taken anti-fracking back. He’s taken pretty much everything back, but remember, it’s the first thing they say that’s what they stick with. Biden’s anti-police crusade must stop. As president, I will always stand with the heroes of law enforcement, that’s why we’re here. I was honored to receive the endorsement of 48 sheriffs right here in Florida three weeks ago, and all over the country, law enforcement from Texas, Arizona, Ohio, Oklahoma, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, New York’s finest endorsed me. They’ve never endorsed a presidential candidate. The National Troopers Coalition. Chicago, how about that? Chicago police, they endorsed me, Chicago. All the major law enforcement organizations all across our country. They go back home to mommy. Mommy, I’m sorry. I’m sorry. You know the incredible thing about that? I didn’t hear anything except our crowd. No, they have no voice. They’re screaming at the top of their lungs, but their lungs are very small, and I didn’t hear, all of a sudden, you hear wah like this right here. That’s true. People, if you wouldn’t recognize them, we wouldn’t even know they’re here. Now tomorrow, the headline is, so you have one young protester, the headline will be tomorrow, Trump’s rally broken up by protests. One very young girl, she’s a girl …. girl, she looks like she’s like about … years old. How the hell has that happened? 200 generals and … leaders, also hundreds of … spouses … given their complete and total endorsement … to uphold our land and to uphold our …. as written on Saturday … announcing my nominee to the … States Supreme Court. It’s true. It’s going to be a big deal. We’re doing it at the White House, the Rose garden of the White House unless it’s raining. In which case, we’ll still do it there. That’s okay. It’s beautiful, the White House. So beautiful. We love the White House, right outside the Oval Office. They don’t want us to do it. The Democrats say, “You shouldn’t do it.” Why? We have a lot of time. Let me ask you the one simple question. If it was them, instead of us, do you think they do it? I think so. No, this will be a very talented person. It will be a woman. I’m sorry, man. It will be a woman. All right. Ready? Who wouldn’t rather see a man? Oh, that’s trouble. Try it again. Who would rather see a man? That’s not good. Who would rather see a woman? I think it would be, really, I think it would take tremendous courage. I don’t care how great the man is. Ladies and gentlemen, I’d like to tell you that Jim Fitzgerald, and then you would see a lot of very unhappy faces. Right? My opponent refuses to release his lists of potential justices because they will be handpicked by extremists like Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Sometimes known as AOC plus three, right? AOC. One of the three I think is Omar, right? But they’ll pick her first. So, if Biden does that, if he puts an extremist in to that position, he loses everything that’s like normal. If he does the other way, he loses the left. So, he doesn’t want to give a left. I’d love to have him put up a list. I’d like to see what that, I could see what that list would be. I could already tell you the people on that list. It would not be good. It would not be pretty. You would not be happy. That would be the end. If given power, Biden and his supporters would pack the court. They’re talking about pack into court, because we have one race. We have one. I’ll tell you what. So this will be my third and we’re in great shape. You see what’s going on with the Republican party, how unified the Republican party is? Right. Now we’re unified. It’s a beautiful thing to say. Thank you, Mitt. Thank you. Appreciate it. Even Mitt’s on board. Even Mitt’s on board. No, it’s a good thing to see having a unified part. Of course, when they did the impeachment hoax, we had 197 to nothing in the house and 52 and a half to a half. That was Mitt, but that’s okay. I’m no longer angry at Mitt, because he’s being very nice on the Supreme Court. He’s doing the right thing. I just want him to do the right thing, but they want to pack the court. You know what that means? They want to put on a lot of justices. These are things that are just horrible. I guess we could do that too. Right? We could do that too. But remember, it was Harry Reid that made this all possible. They’re angry at us. Listen, Chuck, Crying Chuck, you know who Crying Chuck is? Chuck. Every time you complain, remember it was Harry Reid, your person in charge. He had your job before. It was Harry Reid who made this all possible. Thank you very much, Harry. I hope you’re enjoying your evening. No, they blame us. Harry Reid gave us the power, nuclear … very much, but he wants to pack the Supreme Court with radicals who will terminate the second amendment, confiscate your firearms, eliminate the right to self defense, strike under God from the pledge of allegiance and all other places, tear down crosses from public spaces and force taxpayers to fund extreme late term abortion. These far left … violent criminals, shield foreign terrorist, impose sanctuary cities and declare the death penalty totally unconstitution. Hey, it will be totally unconstitutional. They wanted to declare it unconstitutional for even the most depraved mass murderers. And it’s a tough thing. It’s a tough thing. They came to my office today and the death penalty for clemency. I said, “What was the crime?” The crime was so horrible that I won’t tell you what it was, but it’s been going on for 21 years or so. The crime was so horrible that this person committed, that I said, “Look, I just can’t talk about it.” It was so horrible. That’s usually the case, usually the case like the Boston bomber. By the way, they want to give votes to prisoners, people in prison. They want to give votes. So we immediately said, remember Bernie? Crazy Bernie. Bernie is, I’ll tell you one thing about him. He’s the greatest loser I’ve ever seen. No, true. No, I mean that in a respectful way, because what they did to him with Hillary was bad, but this time was even worse. Elizabeth Pocahontas Warren would have left the campaign one day before super Tuesday, Bernie with her ideology basically, because she’s a radical left and she was really fresh to him, but she was really fresh. How bad was Elizabeth Warren to Joe Biden? There’s only one person that was worse. Who was worse? Kamala. I said he’ll never, this shows you my great instinct, my great knowledge of politics. I said, “He will never pick Kamala because no human being has been treated worse than anybody than Kamala.” Remember, she called him a racist. She called him xenophobic. She called him all sorts of things. She called him things that were so bad, I can say them. I can’t say them, but she called him a lot of things. I said, “Well, she’s out.” Then he picks her. She picks her. You always pick people going up, not going down in the polls. If I were get to pick, and by the way, how good is Mike Pence? Is he great? Okay. He’s a rock. He’s a solid guy and he’s a great guy and a great vice president. He worked so hard. He’s all over the place. He’s in Michigan. He’s everywhere. Where you go today, Mike? I went to Michigan, North Carolina, South Carolina. I went to Wisconsin and the guy, I’ll tell you what, he’s an incredible guy and he’s a great guy. He loves the people of this country. He loves our country. You cannot do better than Mike Pence. You know that. If you want to save America, you must get out and vote. In just three and a half years, we’ve secured our borders, rebuilt the awesome power of the US military, obliterated ISIS caliphate 100%, fixed our disastrous trade deals and they were a disaster. I read some of them. I said, “Who agrees to this stuff?” Stupid people agree to it, and brought jobs back home to America. We brought them back. You had the greatest year you’ve ever had last year, the greatest year you’ve ever had. Under 16 years of presidents, Obama and Bush, household income rose only $2,945. Okay. That’s over a course of 16 years, close to 3,000, right? In three years and including energy because look at the saving. How are you doing at the gas pump? Not so bad, right? Did you ever see that? You ever think that was going to happen? In three years, so that was less than 3,000 over 16. In three years, you went up $10,000, including energy. We lifted 6.6 million people out of poverty, the largest poverty reduction in the first three years of any president in the history of our country. We built the greatest economy in the history of the world. Not only here, anywhere. We were beating everybody. For years, I heard that China in 2019, was going to overtake us, right? That didn’t happen. Then they released the plague, but that didn’t happen. And it still’s not happening with the plague, because they got hit hard themselves. I wonder if they understood that they were going to get hit too. But the plague came here, they could have stopped it. They could have stopped it from going all over the world. 188 countries all over the world, including Europe and the United States. We’ve added a record 10.6 million jobs in the last four months, including 3.3 million jobs for Hispanic Americans. That’s a record. When the plague arrived from China. We launched the largest national mobilization since World War Two. We pioneered life saving therapies, reducing the fatality rate 85% since April, you see what’s happened. Europe has almost a 50% greater excess mortality rate than the United States. And now you see they’re being hit very hard. The fake news was saying, “Well, I don’t know if you’ve done as well as Europe.” I said, “We did better than Europe.” And now Europe is exploding again, unfortunately, I don’t want that to happen, but they don’t want to talk about that because that’s not good for their narrative. Our early and aggressive action saved many millions of lives through Operation Warp Speed, we developed and distribute a vaccine. We will have a vaccine so soon you won’t even believe it. Although they’re trying to do a little bit of a political hit today, just a little bit, you notice that? Let’s delay the vaccine just a little bit. But we have three great companies and then others also. Johnson & Johnson, right? Pfizer, Moderna, great companies, all of them, great companies. And they’re right there. They’re way advanced, way advanced, they’re in the final steps. I took historic action to get critical relief for American workers. Through our paycheck protection program, we save 3.2 million Florida jobs. We’re launching a historic effort to bring our medical supply chains back home, where they belong. In 1996, Joe Biden voted to obliterate Puerto Rico’s thriving pharmaceutical industry. I am reversing that and we’re going back so that Puerto Rico can get its pharmaceutical industry back, and they’re going to have it back soon. That was Joe Biden that did that. And then they’ll vote because automatic, they vote for a Democrat. What’s the purpose? He’s the one that did it. He’s the one. Look what he did, how devastated, look at what he did to our African-American community. And people don’t want to talk about it. But what he did was devastating. Devastating. He’s not good for anyone, let’s face it. Last week, I also announced an additional $13 billion that goes to disaster relief for Puerto Rico. They got hit hard. I hope they remember that. That was given by Trump, not by the Democrats. Our hearts are also with the communities in the Panhandle. I love the Panhandle. Ron will tell you. I’ll tell you. You’re a great governor and he’s doing a great job. He called up, he said the Panhandle’s hit, sir. They love you in the Pan-, I think I’m at about 99. 9% in the Panhandle. But we took care of the Panhandle, you remember Hurricane Sally? That was not good, but we took care of it. Ron came into my office, he’d say, “Sir, we need more money.” I said, “How much?” He gave me a number you don’t even want to believe. I said, “You got it, Ron. Don’t come back, Ron.” He comes back about three days later, “Sir, we need more money.” But that’s I guess, a good governor. That’s what a good governor does, right? That’s what a good governor does. I approved a major disaster declaration for the State of Florida last night. And we will be with you every step of the way, every step, we’re there so fast. We sometimes, other presidents took long time to approve them. I approve them before the storms hit shore, because we know what’s going to happen. We took care of Florida. On November 3rd, Florida will decide whether we end the pandemic and return to record prosperity, or whether we allow Joe Biden to kill the recovery, delay the vaccine, impose a $4 trillion tax hike, ban American energy, which he wants to do, destroy the suburbs. He’s going to destroy the suburbs. Give free healthcare to illegal aliens, which means millions and millions of people are going to pour into our country and indoctrinate your children with poisonous anti-American lies in their class, in their school room. To combat the toxic left wing propaganda in our schools, I announced something last week that was very popular. That we’re launching a new pro-American lesson plan for students called 1776 Commission. We’ll teach our children the truth about America, that we are the most exceptional nation on the face of the Earth. And you haven’t seen anything yet. You see what we’re doing. I’ve also issued an executive order to prohibit the teaching of critical race theory in the federal government. That hateful Marxist doctrine paints America as a wicked nation, seeks to divide everyone by race, rewrites American history, and teaches people to be ashamed of themselves and be ashamed of their country. That’s not happening anymore. We fired so many of these wise guys. We had one getting $350,000 a year teaching our military this stuff. And he said, “What happened?” We said, “You’re fired. Get out.” Many people. No, it’s become a cancer. It’s like a cancer, but many, many people gone. They’re all gone. And if they’re not, let us know and we’ll let them go. But we have to unite together as one proud American family. That’s what we are. We’re joined tonight by some incredible warriors, some incredible people. One of them that I’m most proud of is a man that came to this state and what a job he’s done. Your great governor, Ron DeSantis. He’s doing a great job. Ron is doing a great job. Ron, how are we doing on the election? How are we doing on November 3rd, Ron? He says, good. We better do good. He won a great primary, then he beat a man that they said had a good future. I’m not thinking his future is looking to good. How’s his future. I don’t think it’s to good right now. Ron was great, tough and strong, and he didn’t choke under pressure. That’s for sure. But much more important than Ron is the First Lady of Florida, Casey DeSantis. The Mayor of Jacksonville, a really good guy. I got him to really, he wanted to do it so bad. We wanted to have our Republican National Convention right here in Jacksonville. But the timing was a little bit bad. We got hit a little bit with COVID, as they say, we got hit a little bit with the China virus, but I’ll tell you what, Lenny Curry was absolutely fantastic. Your mayor, Lenny Curry. All right. You ready? Some of the greatest, toughest warriors you’ll ever meet. During the impeachment hoax, they said, this is the biggest pile of crap you’ve ever seen. I’m the only guy in history that got impeached for an absolutely perfect conversation. It was perfect. We sent it around. Everyone said, “What’s wrong with this? We sent it to the Justice Department, please check this. Thank goodness we had people that were taking it down, right? Exact notes, great patriots. They took it down, two of them, and it was perfect. We sent it to the Justice Department. Please examine this conversation. We’d like to know what you think. They called back, they said, “Okay, listen, what exactly are you looking for here?” These guys are used to looking at killings and drug dealers and they’re saying, “Explain to us, what are you looking for? We don’t see it.” This was the greatest hoax. And today, by the way, you see what happened. They caught him. They’ve got him cold. They got him cold. We’ll talk about it in a sec. They caught him. They now find out that Trump was a hundred percent truthful. It was a hoax. They got him cold, it was just announced. Dan Scavino just said, “It’s the biggest, it’s the hottest thing on the internet.” They got him cold. We’ll talk about it in a second. But these are warriors. When I needed warriors, I had Representative Matt Gaetz. Where is he? Matt, what a great guy. What a guy. Big future. Thank you, Matt. What a warrior. Thank you. He’s very shy on television, right? I noticed. He’s great. Thank you, Matt. Ted Yoho. Ted, where’s Ted? Great job. Now, a man that is in charge of all spying. He was so good that Matt and Ron and Ted and Mike Waltz, and a lot of people came to see me. Mike, another great one. Thank you, Mike. Is John Rutherford here? Good job, John. Thank you for the help. Thank you, John. But Mike Waltz has been so great and candidate for Congress, Kat Cammack. Kat. So Kat was in the Oval Office yesterday, right? And I said, “How you doing?” “Sir, I’m up 42.” I said, “42 what?” 42 points. That was a big Trump district, right? You’re not in any real trouble. That’s for sure. She’s got it. That was a great win you had, she’ll be with us a long time, a long time. I really appreciate it. And we also have some others that are running for different offices in the Republican Party. And we love the Republican Party. They have been incredible. They have been incredible. We also have some of our really unbelievable, undercover operatives. And if you don’t mind, I won’t introduce them. All right? I don’t think we’re going to introduce them. I want to so badly. I want to have them stand up and bring them up here. I want to hug him and kiss him, which I’m not allowed to do because of social distancing. But somehow they’ve may lose some effectiveness if I introduce them. So they’re in the crowd. I saw two of them and I won’t bother, but they are great, great champions of our country. And also here is a woman who was so, I mean, she was tough. She was in charge of a great state, Michigan. As you kept asking me, “Come back, you’re going to win.” Everyone said Republicans hadn’t won Michigan in many decades. And I felt I should because I was bringing back and I was doing so much for the business and jobs and bringing people back and recommending and telling them, you’re losing your business to Mexico, Canada. And they gave me, 12 years ago, they gave me the man of the year in Michigan. And I made this crazy speech that I said, “You’re losing all your jobs to Mexico.” And all of a sudden I’m running for office and a woman who handled it was unbelievable. She’d say to me, “Sir, would you please come and make a speech?” I said, “Who are you?” “My name is Ronna McDaniel. I’m in charge of Michigan.” Where’s Ronna? She said, “My name is Ronna McDaniel. I’m a charge of Michigan.” I said, “I hear we don’t have a chance.” We should win Michigan. But I hear, “You’re going to win it if you come here.” So I went and made a speech. Then I went and made another speech. Then she’d call again and again, I couldn’t take it. And then I said, “Look, I’ll do one more.” She wanted me to do one more. She said, “I’m telling you, you’re going to win. Do one more.” This is two weeks left. And I said, “All right, this is it, though, this is it.” I’ve devoted a lot of time to Michigan. And everyone says you can’t win. By the way, just got a poll, we’re three points up in Michigan. She said, “Sir,” then she used to call me Mr. Trump, I wasn’t president yet. She said, “Sir, please, just this one time, this is it, three weeks out.” I said, “All right, this is it. Can’t do anymore. I’ve got to go to a lot of states. That’s it.” “This is it, sir, I promise.” So I did it. Then the night before the election, she said, “Sir, you’re going to win Michigan, but you got to make one more stop.” I said, “You got to be-” And I made it on election day. I arrived at 1215 in the now morning. That was now election day, right? I started speaking at one o’clock in the morning on election day. My wife said, “Are you crazy?” We had 32,000 people. And the reason I went, she wanted us there. But we found out that crooked Hillary Clinton, Barack Hussein Obama, and Mrs. Obama and Bill Clinton were traveling to Michigan unexpectedly because as Bill Clinton told them three months ago, “You’re going to have trouble with Trump and Michigan.” They don’t want to listen to him. they said, ‘Oh, well,” because he’s a natural politician. And he said, “You’re going to have trouble in Wisconsin too, and be careful of Minnesota.” This was Clinton. Remember they were laughing, they thought he was very funny. But they knew they were in trouble. So they flew there. They had 500 people. I went there. I start speaking at one in the morning with 32,000 people in Grand Rapids, Grand Rapids. In Grand Rapids. And I said, it’s like this. I said, “We’re not going to lose this state.” You can’t lose. When you have a crowd, you can’t lose. You can look at a crowd, I can look at this crowd. I can say, “Look at it.” As far as the eye can see, as far as the eye can see. I’d leave here, I said, “We’re not losing Florida.” I can tell you that, you could tell, you can feel it. You can feel it. You have an instinct. We’re joined as well by a group of incredible supporters who have recently walked away from the Democrat Party. They walked away from the Democrats. They just registered as Republicans. Thank you. Thank you. And they’re going to be voting for us. It’s just a whole big group of people. And I thank you. And you’re all over the place. Thank you, thank you. They know. It’s called, they’re smart and they have common sense. We’ve spent the last four years reversing the terrible damage Joe Biden inflicted over the last 47 years. Together, we’ve taken on a corrupt and broken system that’s been throwing everything at us from the very beginning. And remember this and I say it all the time. I’ve done more in 47 months than Joe Biden’s done in 47 years. But today a trove of text messages was released from the FBI agents involved in the Russia witch hunt. You had to see this. This is what I was talking about before. The headline from the Federalist reads, Trump was right, explosive new FBI texts detail internal furor over handling of the crossfire hurricane investigation. That was the name. We caught him. We had him before this, but this is like, remember the insurance policy, darling, darling. Oh, I love you so much, darling. She’s going to win, isn’t she? Yes. 100 million to one. That’s not good odds for me. They might not have been great, but they were a lot better than that. 100 million to one, Lisa, I love you so much. But if for some reason she doesn’t win, we have an insurance policy, that’s what we’ve been living through, their insurance policy. You can’t be any more obvious than that. These people are scum. They were trying to do a coup, who would think? And we caught them. Before that, we caught them spying on our nation and they’ve gotten caught. Let’s see what happens with them now. But this was a big day. This was a big day. Never forget they are coming after me because I am fighting for you, there’s a lot of truth to that. For decades, our politicians spent trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign wars, and defending foreign borders. But now we are finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities, and we are bringing our jobs, our factories, and our troops back home to the USA. Joe Biden championed every globalist betrayal of America for 47 years. He was a cheerleader for NAFTA, the worst trade deal ever made, emptied out your factories. And he was a cheerleader for China’s entry into the World Trade Organization. I took the toughest ever action to stand up to China’s rampant theft of American jobs. And I proudly signed a historic executive order, making it official government policy to buy American and hire American. By the way, you ever seen this guy? He’s using my slogan. He’s using my slogans. I saw him the other day. It’s like, buy American. I said, “I’ve been saying that for five years,” right? He’s using my, he has no clue, I’m telling you. You got to come up with your own slogans, Joe. We invested $2.5 trillion in the U.S. military and launched the first new branch of U.S. Armed Forces in nearly 75 years after the Air Force, the Space Force. Right here. We passed VA choice and VA accountability. Nobody thought that could happen. We have a 91% approval rating of the VA. 91% approval rating, highest in history, highest ever. Do you ever see, I don’t want to say this to them because they’ll find the vets, is there an unhappy vet some place? 91% approval. Remember, we used to always watch every night, you’d see things on the news about how badly the vets are treated. Now we have a 91% approval rating. My guys are doing a great job. And today, I can announce that the VA is approving a new $46 million lease for a brand new Veterans Healthcare Clinic in North Jacksonville. We killed the founder and leader of ISIS, Al-Baghdadi. We took out the world’s number one terrorist. All over the world, number one. The mass murder of American troops and many others, Qasem Soleimani is dead. Took him out. He deserved to be taken out. We withdrew from the last administration’s disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal. $150 billion, do you know what he got for it? Nothing. 1.8 billion in cash. He got nothing, nothing. I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, and instead of endless war, we are forging peace in the Middle East. You saw what is happening there. In fact, I was nominated for two Nobel Peace Prizes last week. You know the story. You know the story. And I told our great First Lady, I said, “First Lady, I was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. I’m going to come home early. I’m going to watch it on NBC News,” which is one of the biggest scam jobs I’ve ever seen. NBC probably worse than CNN, NBC. “But we’re going to watch it. We’re going to watch the evening news. So we’ll watch the second place NBC.” You know it is. It’s second place. They spent all this money on PR and then I hit them hard. But they are bad. I said, “First Lady, wait till you see it. Nobel Peace Prize. This will definitely be the biggest thing.” All right, ladies and gentlemen, NBC News, they start off with you. They said you got some heavy rain. They started off with something else, something else, something else, something else. Now the show’s almost over. I said, “First Lady, they’re not mentioning the Nobel Peace prize. This is very embarrassing.” But then it was okay because two days later, I got nominated again. That was for Israel. I got nominated again. Remember when Obama got it, they said, “Ladies and gentlemen, Barack Hussein Obama has just been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.” So what happened? I said, “First Lady, I just got nominated again. This time for Kosovo-Serbia. They’re not killing each other anymore. I stopped it. It’s totally different.” The first was Israel, Bahrain, UAE. This one was close to a totally different one. I don’t know if that’s ever happened before. I said, “First Lady, let’s give it another shot.” We watched the news, never even mentioned it. When Barack Obama got his Nobel Prize immediately after he got elected, they asked him, “Why did you get it?” He had no clue. Nobody knew. Nobody knew. And it was a big story. Breaking news. “We have breaking news.” They didn’t have breaking news when I got it, but that’s why we understand the press. We understand them very well. They’re fake. The last administration made a pathetic one-sided deal with a Castro dictatorship that betrayed the Cuban people and enriched the communist regime. My opponent stands with socialists and communists. I stand with the proud people of Cuba, Nicaragua, Venezuela in their righteous struggle for freedom. And you’re going to win that very soon. You’re going to win that very soon. The last administration also negotiated the terrible Obama-Biden-Santos deal with Colombian drug cartels. They surrendered the narco terrorists. They surrendered to them and they caused illicit drug production to soar. Under my administration, we worked with our Colombian partners to launch a historic rival operation against the drug traffickers. And since April, we have seized or disrupted 227 metric tons of poisonous narcotics. Nobody has ever done anything like it. Joe Biden opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden. He opposed killing Soleimani. He voted for the Iraq War. He backed the disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal. And he cheered for the rise of China as a positive development for our country. I don’t think so. That was a disaster. Now Biden is put forward the most dangerous and extreme platform of any major party nominee in history. The band news is he doesn’t even know what the hell it is. The Biden plan would destroy social security and destroy protections for pre-existing conditions. It will drain your Medicare by giving free healthcare to illegal immigrants that will come over to this country by the millions when they see this. End virtually all immigration enforcement and oppose totally open borders. He would terminate our travel bans on jihadist regions. Remember, I got that approved. They kept saying, “Oh, he lost. He lost. He lost.” And then I won in the Supreme Court. We have a travel ban. Guess what? And increase refugee admissions by over 700%, opening the flood gates to radical Islamic terrorism. He wants to ban school choice and ban charter schools, which are absolutely imperative for our children. In a second term, I will provide school choice to every parent in America. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans. And in conclusion, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we will end our reliance on China once and for all. We will make our medical supplies right here in the United States. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assault on law enforcement and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. We will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms. Second Amendment. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens and we will keep out of America, of our great country, we will stay away from those ridiculous, endless, foreign wars. They never end. Endless foreign wars. They’re all coming home. They’re all coming home. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might and we will ensure peace through strength. And nobody has strength like we have strength. Peace through strength. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency, and further reduce health insurance premiums and the cost of prescription drugs. They’re going to becoming down by 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70% favored. Favored Nations. Favorite Nations Clause, we’ll be paying as low as anybody in the world. It’s called Favored Nations. Nobody had the guts to do it. And they are spending a lot of money on ads against me right now, that Big Pharma. They are spending a lot of money. We will strongly protect Medicare and social security, and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. Thank you. That's really nice. I had such a nice life before doing this. But no administration has ever done in the first three and a half years, not even close, what we’ve done, and that’s very gratifying, I want to tell you that. And thank you very much. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, “In God we trust.” For years, you had a President who apologized for America. Now you have a President who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of Florida. So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers and get out and vote. We have to win this election. Most important election we’ve ever had. Early voting has already begun. Don’t wait, vote. It’s safe. Go out and vote. I hear we’re doing very well, by the way. That’s what the word is. We’ll see. We’ll see. But I hear we’re doing very well. From Tampa to Tallahassee, from Orlando to Miami, from Pensacola to right here in Jacksonville, we stand on the shoulders of Florida patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for this beloved nation. We inherit the legacy of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blazed the trails, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, raised up the skyscrapers, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and from here, in this beautiful, beautiful state, this sun drenched state of Florida, we launched American astronauts to the moon, we made America into the single greatest nation in the history of the world, and the best is yet to come. You watch. Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning the power to you, the American people. With your health, your devotion, your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of Florida, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Florida. Thank you, Florida.

"69","09-25-20","Thank you very much. And thank you to Herschel. I don’t know about Herschel. I don’t know. I don’t know. I don’t know about Herschel. I’d watch him in college, I’d watch him carry that ball, but I think he’d do just as well as a senator or a governor. We’re going to have to start talking to him about that. He’s a fantastic person, great man. I’m honored to be back in the heart of Georgia with the truly incredible organization, Black Voices for Trump. And we appreciate it. In 39 days, we’re going to win four more years in the White House. And we will do it with a record number of votes from the Black community, we have no doubt. That’s all happening. That’s all happening. We’re getting a lot of the people back there, they’re saying, “What’s going on over here?” They’re not happy about it, but that’s okay. Our movement is welcoming millions of Black Americans back to the Republican party, the party of Frederick Douglass and Abraham Lincoln. Right? When I ran for president four years ago, I looked at the dismal and shameful record of the Democrat party. And as Black Americans, what the hell do you have to lose? Right? And they all said, “You shouldn’t use the word hell.” But I said, “It’s just, it’s more descriptive. Doesn’t work as well without it.” Today, I want to share what you have to gain from voting Republican on November 3rd. It’ll be the biggest election of our lives. For decades, Democrat politicians like Joe Biden have taken Black voters for granted. They made you big promises before every election. And then the moment they got to Washington, they abandoned you and they sold you out. The Democrat party used you and they lied to you every single time. You know it better than anybody else knows it. The Democrats will always take back the vote. What they want to do is they’ll take that vote back, they want to take the Black voter for granted, and they have taken the Black voter for granted. And it’s not fair, it’s not right, and it’s not going to happen because we’re going to have such a victory like you’ve never had before. Thank you. Thank you. In 2016, I made you a solemn pledge that whether you voted for me or not, I would be your greatest champion. Since that time, I’ve delivered even more than I promised. It’s one of those things. Few politicians do that. But I believe we have. Before the China virus, we built the greatest economy for African-Americans in the history of our country. And we are doing it again. In the first three years, we achieved the lowest Black unemployment rate in history. The Black youth unemployment rate reached an all time low. We achieved the largest job gains for African-Americans on record. Black Americans saw the largest increase in home ownership. The poverty rate for African-Americans reached the lowest level ever recorded. And last year, 811,000 African-Americans were lifted out of poverty, the most in over 51 years. In my first three years, we lifted 6.6 million people out of poverty, the largest poverty reduction of any president in the history of our country. I did more for the Black community in 47 months … I saw they used that line, so I don’t want to ruin it by saying it a second time. It was in the video, but I will say it again. Than Joe Biden did in 47 years. And I’m here today to announce a brand new plan to deliver more opportunity, more security, more fairness, and more prosperity to Black communities. We call it the Platinum Plan. Platinum Plan. And that’s a contract with Black Americans, and it’s going to be something that people talk about for a long time to come. If you vote Republican over the next four years, we will create three million new jobs for the Black community, open 500,000 new Black owned businesses, increase access to capital in Black communities by $500 billion. This includes investing in community development, financial institutions, and minority depository institutions. Build up peaceful and safer urban neighborhoods with the highest standards of, and you know this, of policing. We want the highest standards. We have to have highest standards of policing. Bring even greater fairness to the justice system. We did criminal justice reform. We remember that. Even greater. We will create a national clemency project to right wrongful prosecutions and to pardon individuals who have reformed their life. You saw Alice, right? We love Alice. She had another 24 years to go. Can you believe it? She served 22 years, she had another 24 years to go. It was ridiculous. And she’s a great woman. Create a ladder of opportunity for African-American children by delivering school choice to every parent in America. So important. Give Black churches the ability to compete for federal resources for their communities. Bring better and tailored healthcare to address the historic disparities that we’ve had for so many years. You know that. This includes investing in treatments for kidney disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, sickle cell disease, and maternal mortality. Advanced home ownership and wealth building in the Black community. Bring more manufacturing back to the USA, which we’re doing anyway. And back to the inner cities, which have been largely forgotten, although not so much in the last three years when you get right down to it. Thank you. End Democrat policies that import low wage foreign workers from overseas to replace Black workers in our inner cities. Joe Biden cares more about the citizens of foreign countries than he does about Black Americans living in our own country. I will always put Americans first. And that includes, very, very importantly, Black Americans. And there’s much more in our plan, which we’re releasing today. So we’ll get everyone a copy, and it’s actually been very well received. And we appreciate that. The Platinum Plan is a bold vision that we can and really will achieve over the next four years that we’ll be able to do it. If not sooner. Unlike my opponent, I’m not a career politician, thank goodness. I get results and I keep my promise. And you’ve seen that. You’ve seen that. Together, we will not only build up America’s Black communities, we’ll help with your vote with the Platinum Plan. We’ll lift up all forgotten communities, and we’ll strengthen our entire nation. And we are going to have an incredible four years. But more importantly, we’re going to have an incredible 40 years. We’re going to have many, many great years because we’re setting a foundation for the future. So when I’m not here, you’re going to be here forever. Especially look at these young people over here. You’re going to really be there for a long time. But we want this for long term. This year, the Republican party has 26 Black Republicans running for Congress. Where are they? Are they here? Are they here? A lot of them are here, right? Whoa. That’s a good looking group of people. And you’re doing well just about in every instance. Well, we’re going to help you to do even better. We’ll be helping you, you watch. And we’re thrilled to be joined today by eight of them. Raise your hand. Which are the eight? Oh, that’s so great. Yeah. They have what it takes. That’s fantastic. Great job. One of them I’ve endorsed very strongly. I saw an ad that I liked. I said, “I thought it was great.” Raise your hand please. They’ve been now endorsed, I will tell you. And congratulations, by the way. It’s going to be a fantastic night, November 3rd. Now, I don’t know. With this ballot situation, you’re not going to see it November 3rd. The Democrats are playing games. You see they found ballots in a wastepaper basket? They found ballots dumped in a stream. Take a look at Iowa, the primaries. You remember the primary? They went to Iowa. We love Iowa, but they tried this ballot concept and they still don’t know who won. That was a long time ago. That was in that primary, the first primary. And it’s a very terrible thing that’s happening. Very, very terrible thing. But you’re going to be raising the hand, if not November 3rd, hopefully shortly thereafter. And I know you’re going to be raising your hand with me. We may end up in a dispute for a long time because that’s the way they want it, but we’re going to end up winning. That’s for sure. Okay? We’re going to end up winning. When I give my State of the Union address next year, I look forward to welcoming a historic number of Black Republican members of Congress. And we’re going to take back the House. We’re going to take back the House. We’ve already won some seats back. They don’t like to talk about that. The fake news, you’ll find out about the fake news. Have you figured out the fake news yet? You’re young and handsome and beautiful. Have you figured out the fake news yet? You’ll learn. You’ll learn. You’ll learn to live with it. You’ll learn to do what you have to do. But we are going to take back the House. I think we’re only 17 short now. We picked up a couple. We just won a big one in Los Angeles we haven’t won in 22 years, California. Won a big one in Wisconsin, it was a great one. We won some really good ones. So we’re inching up. And you watch what’s going to happen. It’s going to be a very big night for the House. It’s got to be a really … Retire Pelosi. That’s not a bad idea. That’s going to be great. Congratulations, all. That’s already a great achievement. It really is. It’s already. But together, we’ll fulfill our contract with Black America and we’ll pass the Platinum Plan into law, and we’ll do it quickly and easily. We’re also joined by a great friend of mine, Dr. Ben Carson. Where’s Ben? Where’s Ben? Ben. I love Ben. Special man. He’s doing a great job too. He’s been my friend from the beginning. Can I tell the one story, Ben? He came up to me, he was campaigning. He was the toughest. I tell you what, we had some really tough ones. A lot of them like to try and say they were tough, but they weren’t, like Kasich. Like Kasich. He only had one thing. He wouldn’t leave the race. He’d get minus one, he’s going on to the next one. This guy did great. He was incredible. And he came up to me during the race and he was doing well, he said, “You know that you’re going to win, don’t you?” I said, “Excuse me.” He said, “You know you’re going to win.” He was doing great. And he was really in second and third and fourth and back to second. I mean, he was right up there. He was great. I learned, I said, “We got to get this guy out of here.” But he came up to me, he did. And he said, “You’re going to win.” And I’ll let him tell you the rest of the story if he’d like to do it sometime. But he gave a very specific reason. And I will never forget what he said. But he said, “You know you’re going to win, don’t you?” And I just thought it was really nice. And you know what I’m talking about, Ben. So Ben Carson, what a job he’s done too. Respected by everybody. Thank you, Ben. And a man who ran in the primary, who I got a call from another great man, David Perdue. He said, “Could you do us a favor? There’s a guy named Brian Kemp and he’s running in a tough primary, he’s got a tough opponent. And do you think you could maybe endorse him?” I love David Perdue. I said, “Who is he? I don’t know him. Okay?” And then he said, ” Well, he’s been for you.” I said, “Well, I’ve heard that before. I better be careful.” And we did a little … Where’s Brian? Where’s Brian? Right over here. Brian. We did a little research. We did a little research. And he has, he was for me all the way. And I said, “That’s good.” The worst thing is when you’re endorsing people that say bad things, right? He only said good. And I got to know him. And I got to know his wife, Marty. And I said, “Absolutely.” And we endorsed him and he won that primary so easily. He won so easily. And they’re still trying to figure out what happened in the race. I’ve been watching. You know what? It wasn’t that close. He won by a lot, actually. He didn’t win by 15 votes. He won by a lot. How many votes was that? That was a lot. Well, we won’t call it a landslide, but it wasn’t very close. You know? How many votes was that, Brian? It was a lot. 51. To me, you know what that is? It’s Yankee Stadium for a World Series. People would say, “Oh, that was tight.” I heard I won Michigan by 12,000. I said, “That’s an almost full Madison Square Garden. Not quite full.” But that’s Yankee Stadium for the World Series. I think that’s a lot. We look at it differently. But I do want to introduce also David Perdue, who he is really an incredible guy. He loves everybody in this room. Where’s David? David. Please stand up. Is that right? Did you make that call? You made that call. He made that call. And that was a good call because your governor’s doing a great job and David’s doing a great job. And I hope you can support David and Brian and all of them. They’re incredible people. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, David, for everything. Thanks also to Oklahoma’s first Black Speaker of the House, T.W. Shannon. Where’s T.W.? I like that. I want to do that. I want to do that. Thank you, T.W. Great reputation. Thank you very much. And a friend of mine who my children, you know, they’ll always be children. They may be a little older than children, but they’re always my children. They love her, Lynne Patton. Lynne, thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Lynne. Thank you. And if you’re a UFC fan, anybody like UFC? I’ll tell you what. That’s right. Usman. He goes Usman. I know who he is. He’s tough, that’s who he is. Kamaru Usman, where is our champ? Come on, champ. Get up. Man, oh man, oh man. What a fighter you are. I don’t want to mess with him. I may weigh a couple of pounds more. Do you think I could take you to fight you? I don’t think so. He goes, “No.” I think you’re right, champ. But I watched a fight you had a couple of months ago, unbelievable talent. But right up here too, it’s a combination. The muscles are important, but you got to have the other. He actually looks very good in a suit, but he’s one of the few people that look better without a suit. There aren’t too many of us. Hey, there aren’t too many of us that can say that. Right? Right, men? The men in this audience, huh? But I just want to thank you, champion. Good luck. I’ll be watching you. You have a big fight coming up and I’ll be watching, and it’s a great group of people. Great group of champions. Thank you very much. Thank you. Another great fighter, Ali Abdelaziz, who is tough. Where is he? There he is. Oh, you’re tough. You’re so tough, the two of you guys. I’d like to see you both fight, but there’s a little weight difference, I guess. Right? You probably think you can take him, right? But what is the difference in weight? What is it? 20? 10? I know, I know. I know. What is it though because… and were you a fighter at one time? You’re pretty good? Not good as him. Nobody else is either. So that’s easy. You were a good fighter. Also, Atlanta’s top hip hop producer, Polow. Where is he? Where is he? Da Don. Don King used to call me the don, right? He still does actually. but you didn’t get it from Don King I know that, right? Nice to see you. Great to have you. Great to have you. Thank you very much. Do we have another UFC fighter here because I have heard, yes? Because I know we had somebody else. I just don’t want to skip in case we do. I have a lot of respect for them. Anybody gets in a ring and does that and comes out winning, to me, I have a lot of respect. And when you become the champ, I want to tell you, that’s a hell of a thing. That’s what you live for, the belt, right? The money or the belt? You know what? If you get the belt, the money comes, right? So great. Great going champ. Fantastic. Over the last 50 years, Black Americans have mostly voted Democrat, but everyday more Black Americans are deciding that the old way is not working. Five decades of evidence proved that Democrat politicians do not care about the black community. They only care about power for themselves, whatever that means. My opponent is offering Black Americans nothing but the same old tired, empty slogans. By the way, he’s staying in again today. The guy. Hey champ, if I lose to a guy that… that’s like you losing to a fighter that hasn’t worked out in the last six months. This guy never goes out. It’s terrible. Oh, you better make sure I win. I’m going to be very embarrassed. I lost to a guy that didn’t campaign. You know why he’s not campaigning? I guess it’s an energy factor. So what the hell is going… if I lose to a man that doesn’t campaign. Every day he announced we’re going to stay in today. I don’t know. Hey, I can’t tell you, but the Democrats are angry at him. They say, “You can’t do that.” I just left Florida and from here I’m going to Washington then I’m going to Virginia, then I’m going to someplace else and someplace else. By the way, I see Kelly and I see Collins back there. Will you please stand up? Please. Those are two champions. So they had their names in there, but they took them out. You know why? Because they probably want to not mention them together. They’re going to end up liking each other, you watch. And they you’re great people. I’m not going to skip them over. They go to be a diplomatic. That’s that diplomatic, that’s stupid, right? But I stand here to offer solutions. I want to congratulate you both. Really fighting a good fight. I want to say that both of you, Doug, Kelly. Really great. Well, I sort of like it. You know why? They’re going to be in there fighting, fighting, fighting. Don’t anybody get out. And everybody’s going to come with them. And the only thing I know for sure, they’re all going to vote for me. Both of [inaudible 00:45:30] So Brian, don’t let them get out. Don’t let anybody get out. But everyone’s going for both of them. It’s got to be, hey, we don’t have long to go either. We don’t have a long time ago. November 3rd. I’ve spent the last four years reversing the horrible damage Joe Biden inflicted on the black community over 47 years. 47 years. He always says, “Oh, I should have done this. I should…” I said you’ve been there for 47 years. It’s always great when they tell you what you should be doing and they haven’t done it themselves. And it’s not like it was 25 years ago that he left. He was there three and a half years ago, right? So it’s one of those things. No one in Washington politics today has done more to hurt Black Americans than Joe Biden. Its true. For half a century, Joe’s personally advocated or enacted virtually every policy that has caused pain and suffering in the black community. You know that. Joe Biden shipped millions of your best jobs overseas, hollowed out the black middle-class and with open borders, trapped children in failing government schools. Sent young men to fight in endless wars. They just never ended. They’re coming back home. You see that. They’re coming back home. Many are already back. While our inner cities crumbled at home and made cities less safe and less secure. Joe Biden should not be demanding your support, he should be begging for your forgiveness. He really should be. He should be. My opponent drafted the 1994 disaster, the 1994 crime bill which caused unfair sentencing disparities that devastated black families. And I mean just… I have heard more about the 1994 and when we did criminal justice reform, it was largely about erasing that terrible act. That was his deal. I rolled back the unfair provisions of the 1994 Biden crime bill. And I signed it into groundbreaking criminal justice reform, which people are so happy about. Even my enemies are saying, thank you for that. Today, we’re glad to be joined by the first person to be released under thee First Step Act who I was honored to have as my guest at the State of the Union. A really wonderful man, Matthew Charles. Where’s Matthew? Where is Mathew? Where is Matthew? What a good man. What a smile. I looked at that smile from the podium downstairs. I was surrounded by all those killer politicians. And I looked at Matthew’s and nicest looking guy in that house. Thank you, Matthew. You’re doing well, Matthew, right? That’s great, Matthew. You deserve what you got. You deserve it. Biden supported the twin disasters of NAFTA and China’s entry into the World Trade Organization which eliminated one in four manufacturing jobs held by Black Americans. You know that. Joe Biden’s globalist agenda closed down factories in Baltimore and sent them… just see what happened to all these factories, all these jobs, all of these factories, sent them to Beijing. He shuttered the plants in Michigan and he sent them to Mexico. I replaced NAFTA. One of the worst trade deals, one of the worst stupidest deals I’ve ever seen in my life with the new US-Mexico-Canada agreement, creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs. That was one they said could not be done, David. Right? They said it couldn’t be done. David Perdue. They said that one couldn’t be done, right, David? And we got it done in pretty quick time too. To revitalize neglected communities, we created nearly 9,000 opportunities zones with Tim Scott of South Carolina. You know Tim Scott. Tim Scott is great. Senator Tim Scott from South Carolina came to my office, came to the Oval Office and he had this idea. And I said, “That sounds good.” And we got it done. And people were surprised that we could even get it done. And it has turned out to be incredible. $75 billion dollars of investment have poured into these neighborhoods, which will create an estimated 500,000 jobs and lift 1 million Americans out of poverty. When the China virus struck, we raced to ensure that Black Americans had the medical care and the financial support that they needed through the Paycheck Protection Program, which was a big deal. We helped save over 200,000 black owned, small businesses. A lot of small businesses. It’s incredible. The black community has tremendous talent in terms of those businesses and small businesses. We saved at least 200, 000 of them. As we continue to battle the virus, my administration is sheltering those at highest risk while rapidly developing treatments. And the vaccine is coming very quickly. I see where a couple of the Democrats don’t want to have the vaccine because they said, “Well, we don’t want it because we think Trump is pushing it too fast.” Well, that’s the reason we’re going to have it. This would have taken years to get. We’re years ahead of schedule. And this would have been two, three years by Democrats. But now they’re very concerned because they’re afraid it’s happening too fast and that means we’re going to get credit. I don’t want credit. We want to save lives. We will crush the virus, our opponents will crush the black middle-class. That’s what they’ve been doing. And they’ve been doing it for a long time. For too long. They will deliver a crippling shutdown and a very steep depression. If he gets elected, this guy, you will have the greatest depression that this country has ever seen. And that includes a pretty big one in 1929. Hello. How are you? Great. I love her dress. That’s great. Thank you for being here. I didn’t know you were going to be here. Thank you very much. Nearly 1.3 million African-Americans have gotten jobs in the last four months alone. And next year I think it’ll be, economically, the greatest year in the history of our country. And that’s good for everyone. That’s good for everybody, right? Especially for these young geniuses, these young political geniuses that are coming along. But I think we’re going to have the greatest year in the history of our country economically. And I think our third quarter, which happens to be… it’s going to be announced two days before… the numbers come out two days before the election, right at the beginning of November. And I mean, I’ll say it now. These people, all those people up there, they’ll hold me to it. They won’t give me credit if I was right but if I was wrong, it’ll be headlines. We have breaking news. Trump said wrong. But I think we’re going to have a tremendous third quarter. After years of rebuilding other countries, we’re finally rebuilding our country. The path to the American dream has always been education. Republicans believe that school choice is the civil rights issue of our time. And Joe Biden isn’t allowed to go there because of the radical left. He’s controlled by the radical left totally. He’s exhausted. But Biden’s promised a ban on charter schools and to oppose school choice. Joe Biden is willing to spend billions and billions upon resettling refugees from all around the world, but he won’t spend one penny providing school choice to black children in America which is interesting. During their first year in office, President Obama and VP Biden cut funding for historically black colleges and universities. I’ve increased HBCU funding and I made it permanent. Just a quick story. So what was happening is that, the first year I saw these probably 42 people came up and they were the heads of individual colleges, historically black colleges, universities. And they were the heads and I see them and I said, “Oh, hello, how you doing?” They were nice people. And we took a picture in the White House. We do that. A lot of presidents don’t believe anyone should ever enter the Oval Office but them. With me, I say, “Come on in.” But we took it picture. Then the next year they were there again. And I said, “Right. We know the story my friend. We know the story.” They were there and I said, “Oh, what are you doing back here?” They said, “We’re here because we need money again.” I said, “What do you mean again?” And I forgot about it. I said, “All right. Well, whatevs.” And they got it. And then the third year, David, they came in again, right? And I said, “What is this? What are you guys here for? I mean, you’re great people, but why?” Well, we don’t have any funding. They don’t have permanent funding. So they could be shut out if they had the wrong president. Honestly, you could have the wrong president and you wouldn’t get 25 cents. They wouldn’t give you anything. And I said, “That’s terrible. So you come up here every… do you like doing it?” No. And the one gentleman looked at me, he said, “We feel like beggars.” That was a hell of a statement. I said, “I understand that.” And I said, “We can’t let this happen.” So we worked on it, David Purdue, all of us worked on it. Kelly worked on it. We all worked on it. And I have to say it had to go through the House. And where’s Doug? Doug worked on it. Right Doug? You remember that? That was a hard thing. It wasn’t easy. There were people that didn’t want to do it. And we got it passed. We got more money than they asked for. I said, “You’re going to need more.” I’m in the real estate business. I said, “You always need more. Whatever you think you need, you need more.” But we got more money than they asked for and we got it for a period of 10 years, right? So I said, the only bad… we signed it together. About 42 people. We signed it together. I said, “The only bad thing is that I like your people, I won’t see you anymore. I won’t see you for another 10 years.” Let’s say, will we be president in 10 years? Only if we add a couple of terms. Now we have a story. This is your breaking news. I told you, he’s a dictator. We’ve been saying… he will not give up power. Under no circumstances will he give up power. He intends to serve at least two more terms. Oh, that’s a [inaudible 00:56:57]. You can’t joke, because if you joke, they take it away. A lot of times you add a little sarcasm in your joke, but your big serious, and then you start laughing afterwards. But they always cut it before the laugh. They cut it so that they think he’s serious. He wants 12 more years. They start shouting now, 12 more years. Thank you. Earlier this year, Biden said that if you don’t vote for him, then you aren’t black. You know that. And this was very outrageous. This is offensive. In fact, he was very derisive of the Black Americans when he very negatively compared them to another group of Americans. It was very terrible. And he did it. Biden believes that all Black Americans have to think the same way. That’s what it was all about. Today’s Democrat Party is run by… he doesn’t know Black Americans like I do. Today’s Democratic party is run by out of touch, liberal hypocrites who stereotype you, disrespect you and sell you out. They’re only good for your six month period. Six months before the election and then they’re very nice and they want your vote and then they, as you say, I like that better than what I was to say, they forget all about you. They’re gone. They’re gone. Biden wants to lecture the country about racial justice when he spent his career hurting Black Americans, hurting Hispanic Americans and forging alliances with pro segregation Democrat senators, you know that. Racial justice begins with Joe Biden’s retirement from public life. So today I’m urging Black Americans to walk away from the corrupt, hateful, divisive, and very extreme. And they are going crazy, Democrat Party. On no issue has the Democrat Party more totally failed the black community than public safety. Democrats have run America’s inner cities at every level of government for 100 years and even more. Last year, 19 of the top 20 most dangerous cities in America were run by Democrats. The murder rate is higher in Baltimore than in Afghanistan, El Salvador, or Honduras, right? It’s higher. Instead of fighting for public safety for these communities, the Democrats are attacking our police and empowering far left rioters, looters, and anarchists. They are anarchist. The Democrat Party’s war on cops has caused black owned businesses to be burned and black homes and churches to be totally destroyed. Most tragically of all, so many innocent black lives have been cruelly taken from us. People are dying by the thousands and black on black crime, and I want it to stop. And people aren’t talking about it. They’re not talking about it. They’re not talking about it. In Chicago, as an example, there are weekends when 60, 70, or more people are shot. This is shot and many die. How can we allow this to go on? How can we allow this to happen? But they’re all Democrat run cities. Every year thousands of African-Americans are murdered as a result of violent crime. And again, in these Democrat run monstrosities. The way they run them, it’s worse than Afghanistan. It’s worse than… we are at war. We go to war zones and we don’t lose this many people in war zones. Democrats ignore these American victims and I won’t. And we have to be asked to come in. We have to be asked to come in. By law, they have to say, please come in. And wherever we’ve gone in, Minneapolis, we went in and we solved the problem. They should have called us two weeks earlier. They would have had a city left. But Seattle, they knew we were coming in. I said, “We’re going in? We don’t care. We’re going in.” And night before we went in, they left. That was the end of that and others. I mean, look at Portland. I mean, how bad is Portland? How bad is Portland? And we could solve that one in about a half an hour. A bunch of young anarchists. They live with their parents in a basement also. They live in the [inaudible 01:01:42]. And I’ll always support the heroes of law enforcement, we have to. Including over 50,000 incredible black police officers who risk their lives every day to keep us all safe. They protect people that they’ve never met before. And it’s very dangerous. They’re amazing. Those pushing to defund the police are hurting black communities the most. And as I’ve always said, when there is police misconduct, the justice system must hold wrongdoers fully responsible and accountable and they will. And they will do that. Politicians supporting mob violence are not allies of the black community, they’re causing extraordinary damage grief hardship. In recent months, our nation is grieved for the tragic deaths of Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, and Ahmaud Arbery. Our hearts break for their families and for all families who have lost a loved one, especially if you look at it this way. So senseless. But we can never allow mob-rule. To have safety, to have prosperity, to have everything that you want to have, we must always ensure the rule of law. As you know, we have to. Many of those who are spreading violence in our cities are supporters of an organization called the Black Lives Matter or BLM. It’s really hurting the black community. It’s hurting the black community. This is an unusual name for an organization whose ideology and tactics are right now destroying many black lives and whose first phrase was, you remember this, “Pigs in a blanket, fry them like bacon,” referring to our police. That’s referring to our police. The stated goal of BLM organization people is to achieve the destruction of the nuclear family, abolish the police, abolish prisons, abolish border security, abolish capitalism, and abolish school choice. That’s what their stated goals are. This is not the agenda of the black community. This is the agenda of an extreme socialist, or worse, you know what the other word is. Yeah, Marxist, communist. But this is the extreme socialist left, but beyond that, in my opinion. That’s why the founders of the organization call themselves “trained Marxists.” And yet we have major corporations out of weakness or fear or whatever reason donating hundreds of millions of dollars to them. These are fools. These are fools. The big progressive corporations donating to BLM should instead be spending their money helping black families rebuild from these horrible left-wing riots. Wealthy liberal hypocrites want to defund the police in our inner cities while living behind walled compounds. Their walled compounds. You got to see the way some of these people live. They live pretty well. The funny thing is that if anything ever happened, they’d be the first to go. You know that, right? “Let’s go get these people.” They’re fools. They want to get rid of school choice for black children while sending their own children to the best private schools in the land. They want to open borders, and that’s what they want, they want open borders for you but security for themselves. They want top security, but let’s open up the borders. Let’s let everybody pour into our country so that you won’t have jobs left, you won’t have anything left. And it’s a tremendous public health crisis. We built now over 330 miles of wall and it will be finished soon. Our numbers are in the border are now the best they’ve been in decades and it’s incredible what’s happened. The wall has been incredible. 330 miles, David, that’s pretty good. A long way considering we had a party that didn’t want to let us build the wall. They wanted the wall 10 years ago. They really wanted the wall. And as soon as I wanted it, they didn’t want it. And I said it last night. We had a tremendous rally last night with probably 35,000 people. I said it last night, I said I made a mistake. I should have said, “We will not build a wall,” and we would have had funding in about 15 minutes. Instead, I had to win six different lawsuits. This was not easy. Crazy Nancy. She’s crazy. And do you notice how quiet it is now? Now that it’s 330 miles, it’ll be completed, we’re doing 10 miles a day on average. Think of this. I don’t hear any more about the wall. They don’t want to talk about the wall anymore, but the numbers are great. Republicans will always uphold equal justice under the law. We will defend the civil rights of every single American, and we will defend our God-given freedoms, including religious liberty. And the Second Amendment, by the way. I have to save our Second Amendment. I’m the only thing standing between you and me and Second Amendment, I’m standing. We’re not going to be losing our Second Amendment. They’re going to get rid of it. You know who they put it in charge? Beto. Remember Beto? Beto O’Rourke. That’s a Spanish name. He needed the Spanish vote, right? He said, “I want Spanish.” I said, “What about Hispanic?” He said, “I don’t know about that.” He knows less about it than perhaps I do. But Beto, I remember he had a cover in a terrible magazine. And they said he said that, “I was born to run for president.” He was hot then even though he just lost a race to. He was hot, and he said, “I was born to run for president.” Anybody that says that is a sure loser. Can you imagine if I said that, I said, “I was born to run for president.” You’d say, “This guy’s whacked out.” It’s not an easy deal going on over here. I had a very nice life before, you know that? You read about my life. You knew a lot about my life. I had a great life. What the hell did I do this for, David? Why did I do this for, David Purdue? No, I enjoy it. You know why I enjoy it? I love it. Oh, by the way, did you see, they just got the FBI? Did you see the text messages? It’s brutal. One of the guys said, “Listen, this is really illegal. I want insurance.” They bought insurance for these people because they thought they’re going to be locked up. We got it. Now they’re going crazy. This is the hottest thing right now on the internet all over the place, boy. They’ve been looking at me. So essentially then, it was the exact opposite. And you see Biden’s son? He got three and a half… Hunter. Where’s Hunter? Where’s Hunter? You know what I do? I call him “Where’s Hunter.” That’s his name. Where’s Hunter. We made a t-shirt, I was making a speech, I said, “Where’s Hunter?” I’m looking at this… I was kidding. I said, “Where’s Hunter?” The next day it was the biggest selling t-shirt in the history. Where’s Hunter? No, Hunter got a check back from the wife of the mayor of Moscow for three and a half million. Would anybody except whatever he was supposed to do for three and a half million? There’s no job that I can think of. Three and a half million. Now before Biden became vice president, he got nothing. He had no money, no nothing. Got thrown out of the military. He got thrown out. He had no job. Now he’s getting checks for three and a half million from the mayor, the ex mayor, very substantial person, by the way, of Moscow. So we got it wrong. It wasn’t Trump. I have nothing to do. I didn’t have a phone call. Now think of it, let’s call Bob Mueller, put him on the case. Thank you. He said, “Let’s call Bob Mueller.” I stole from him. Hey, I plagiarized from him like Biden. That was very good. He says, “Let’s call Bob Miller.” Bob’s a sharp guy. He’ll get him. He’ll figure it out. How about me? Three years of investigation, [inaudible 00:07:49], they find nothing. A friend of mine, very smart in New York said, very smart, he said, “You must be the most honest person and in the world. When 19 geniuses, bad people, but geniuses, plus unlimited law enforcement, 49 FBI agents, two and a half years, can’t find anything. You got to be the cleanest person in the world.” But it turned out to be the opposite story. It was them who was dealing with Russia. David, if you guys could start working on that when you get back. Doug, please, if you don’t mind. You were so incredible to me, and if you don’t mind, think of it, it was the exact opposite, Doug. He’s trying to defend us. “Please, defend the president.” Well, it turned out to be the opposite. They were the ones that were dealing with Russia. It was a disinformation campaign. Kelly, start working on that with David, please. Okay? I think Monday morning would be okay. We are appointing a Supreme Court justice today. We are. That’s a big deal. The Democrats, they don’t think we should do it, because actually we have a lot of time left. It’s really January 20th. We have a lot of time left, but they don’t think we should do it because it’s toward the end of the fist. Well, we’ve got a lot of time left. Now, put them in our shoes. You think they’d say, “Well, I think we should probably not do this.” What chance do we have of that, Dave? Zero, would you say? No, the only difference is they would have gone even crazier. They would have gotten totally. They would have been fighting, “Let’s get it done immediately.” They would be working over the weekend. They have been not good to deal with. But you know what? When we built this great success, it started to all come together, then we got interrupted by China. What they did, they should never have done that. They should remember this, we can never forget it. But it was starting to come together, and it will come together because we’re going to have an even greater success, in my opinion, next year. Well, Democrats have tried to silence pastors, and we had some great pastors up here. I watched backstage. I watched those guys and I said, “I don’t want to follow them. I want to follow them.” I was looking for somebody else to speak first. But they were great. Weren’t they really great? You know the truth. I could see, they love you, they love the country. They at least like me, because you know what? If they didn’t, they couldn’t do what they just did. They did it from the heart. Didn’t they? Really. I watched that. I won’t forget it either. I’m never going to forget it. I’m not forgetting. I don’t forget things. Thank you. I don’t forget things. Where are the pastors? They got up. Where are they? Where are they? Where are those guys? Man, oh man. I’ll never follow you again. At least we had Herschel in between, right? And Herschel didn’t like it either. That was really great. Thank you both. Thank you all very much. That was beautiful. That was from the heart and we appreciate it. We won’t forget. We won’t forget. I will fiercely defend the vital role of black churches in America. Joe Biden and the Democrats say that black lives matter but they do not protect the most vulnerable black lives of all; unborn children. They support the unlimited abortion of black children right up until the ninth month of pregnancy. And if you look at this governor of Virginia beyond, I had not heard that. But if you look at the governor of Virginia, he said, “The baby is born, and then they start to talk.” I said, “Wait a minute, that’s not abortion. That’s not abortion. You know what that is? No, I call it execution. You’ve seen that, right? I had not heard that. You hear late term abortion. You never heard that. But the governor of Virginia, the one that thinks he’s Michael Jackson, the one whose wife stopped him from trying to imitate Michael Jackson moonwalk. Now one thing we know, he’s not going to be Michael. There’s nobody that can moonwalk like Michael. See. he got very lucky. That would have been the end if he would’ve done that. But the Democrat’s champion Planned Parenthood, an organization founded on racism that continues to target the black community. In the Republican party, we believe in protecting all black lives, including the unborn. We believe that every child, of every race, born and unborn is made in the holy image of God. Republicans believe that all human life is sacred. At no time before has there been a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies, two agendas for the future. Now, you know that. There’s never been a difference like this. Our opponents want our children to grow up in a socialist nation. That will mean less opportunity, less prosperity, less safety and less hope for the future. The Democrat party’s message to your children is that their path is doomed and that their country is evil. My message to every child in America is the exact opposite. I want our children to know that they are part of the most exciting and incredible adventure in human history. No matter where your family comes from, no matter your background, in America, anyone can rise. Democrats divide our country by race, Republicans unite Americans through our shared bonds of citizenship. You see it here. This glorious country is the shared heritage of all Americans. In every generation, black patriots poured out their blood, sweat, heart, and soul to defend American liberty and to realize our founding promise that we are all made equal by the hand of all mighty God. African American leaders lifted up the conscience of our nation to end slavery and segregation and secure your civil rights. Black heroes like Harriet Tubman, Sojourner Truth, Booker T. Washington, Martin Luther King, Rosa Parks and Thurgood Marshall help the most just noble free and exceptional nation on earth. Now with the help of a new generation of black patriots, and there, some of them are right now, we will reach new heights of glory and greatness. And you know this; we are going to revitalize our cities. It’s in the process. We will bring more jobs in factories back to our communities. We will give every single child a chance to reach their full God-given potential. We will build the most inclusive society, the most successful economy, and the most inspiring future the world has ever seen. And we will do it for citizens of every background, every race, religion, color, and creed. Together we made unbelievable progress and achieved once unimaginable success. Nobody thought it was possible. And with your support, your vote, and your voice, the best is yet to come. So this has been a great honor for me. I have a lot of friends in the audience, and I just want to thank you very much. God bless you. God bless America. God bless you all. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
















"
"70","09-26-20","Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. I stand before you today to fulfill one of my highest and most important duties under the United States constitution. The nomination of a Supreme court justice. This is my third such nomination after Justice Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh. And it is a very proud moment indeed. Over the past week, our nation has mourned the loss of a true American legend. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a legal giant, and a pioneer for women, her extraordinary life and legacy will inspire Americans for generations to come. Now, we gather in the Rose garden to continue our never ending task of ensuring equal justice and preserving the impartial rule of law. Today, it is my honor to nominate one of our nation’s most brilliant and gifted legal minds to the Supreme court. She is a woman of unparalleled achievement, towering intellect, sterling credentials, and unyielding loyalty to the constitution, Judge Amy Coney Barrett. We’re also joined by Amy’s husband, Jesse. Thank you Jesse very much and their seven beautiful children. Congratulations to you all, very special day. With us as well our, the first lady, thank you first lady. Along with vice president Mike Pence and his amazing wife Karen. Thank you very much Mike. Judge Barrett is a graduate of Rhodes college and the University of Notre Dame law school. At Notre Dame, she earned a full academic scholarship, served as the executive editor of the law review. Graduated first in her class and received the law school’s award for the best record of scholarship and achievement. Upon graduation, she became a clerk for judge Lawrence Silberman on the U.S Court of Appeals for the district of Columbia. Amy then received one of the highest honors. A young lawyer could have serving as a clerk on the Supreme court for Justice Antonin Scalia. A very highly respected law professor at Notre Dame wrote to Justice Scalia with a one sentence recommendation. Amy Coney is the best student I ever had, that’s pretty good. Justice Scalia hired her shortly thereafter and we are honored to have his wonderful wife, Maureen, where is Maureen? Maureen Scalia with us today. Thank you. And our great secretary of labor. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Very good genes in that family I will say, very good genes. Before joining the bench, Judge Barrett spent 15 years as a professor at the university of Notre Dame law school. She was renowned for her scholarship, celebrated by colleagues and beloved by her students. Three times, she was selected at Notre Dame, distinguished professor of the year. When I nominated judge Barrett to serve on the U.S court of appeals for the seventh circuit in 2017, every law clerk from her time at the supreme court, endorsed her and endorsed her nomination. Writing quote, “We are Democrats, Republicans and Independents, yet we write to support the nomination of professor Barrett to be a circuit judge. Professor Barrett is a woman of remarkable intellect and character. She is eminently qualified for the job.” And I can tell you, I did that too. I looked and I studied and you are very eminently qualified for this job. You are going to be fantastic, thank you, really fantastic. The entire Notre Dame law facility and faculty, everybody at that school also. We got so many letters, also wrote letters of support of Amy’s nomination to the seventh circuit they wrote in effect, “Despite our differences, we unanimously agree that our constitutional system depends upon an independent judiciary staffed by talented people, devoted to the fair and impartial administration of the rule of law. And we unanimously agree that Amy is such a person.” For the last three years, Judge Barrett has served with immense distinction on the federal bench. Amy is more than a stellar scholar and judge she’s also a profoundly devoted mother. Her family is a core part of who Amy is. She opened her home and her heart and adopted two beautiful children from Haiti. Her incredible bond with her youngest child, a son with down syndrome is a true inspiration. If confirmed Justice Barrett will make history as the first mother of school-aged children ever to serve on the U.S supreme court. That’s good. To her children, Emma, Vivian, Tess, John Peter, Liam, Juliet and Benjamin. Thank you for sharing your incredible mom with our country. Thank you very much. Amy Coney Barrett will decide cases based on the text of the constitution as written. As Amy has said, “Being a judge takes courage. You are not there to decide cases as you may prefer. You are there to do your duty and to follow the law wherever it may take you.” That is exactly what Judge Barrett will do on the U.S Supreme court. I want to thank the members of the Senate. We have so many of them here today, thank you very much. I see you in the audience and you’re so proud. But I want to thank you for your commitment and to providing a fair and timely hearing, I know it will be that. Judge Barrett was confirmed to the circuit court three years ago by a bipartisan vote. Her qualifications are unsurpassed, unsurpassed, and her record is beyond reproach. This should be a straightforward and prompt confirmation, should be very easy. Good luck, it’s going to be very quick. I’m sure it’ll be extremely noncontroversial. We said that the last time, didn’t we? Well, thank you all very much and thank you for being here. That’s really great. Thank you. Thank you. I further urge all members of the other side of the aisle to provide Judge Barrett with a respectful and dignified hearing that she deserves and frankly, that our country deserves. I urge lawmakers and members of the media to refrain from personal or partisan attacks. And the stakes for our country are incredibly high. Rulings that the supreme court will issue in the coming years will decide the survival of our second amendment, our religious liberty, our public safety, and so much more. To maintain security, liberty and prosperity, we must preserve our priceless heritage of a nation of laws and there is no one better to do that than Amy Coney Barrett. Law and order is the foundation of the American system of justice. No matter the issue, no matter the case before her, I am supremely confident that Judge Barrett will issue rulings based solely upon a fair reading of the law. She will defend the sacred principle of equal justice for citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed. Congratulations again, to Judge Barrett, I know that you will make our country very, very proud. Please, amy, say a few words. Thank you very much, congratulations, congratulations. Come on up family. Come on up family. I want to acknowledge and Attorney General Bill Barr, Bill thank you very much for being here. Chief of staff, thank you very much chief, doing a great job and all of the senators, please. We really appreciate it and I know you’re going to have a busy couple of weeks, but I think it’s going to be easier than you might think. So thank you very much for being here. Thank you all. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Congratulations Amy.

"71","09-27-20","So we have a list of about 45 people, and it was set up over a period of time, a long period of time, in conjunction with a lot of other people that are very talented, conservative, but very talented people. And it was definitely a time for a woman. And so I had, I broke it down into five women, and this is a person who is just outstanding. A great student, a great scholar. Her professor, one of the most notable and actually the, probably one of the most respected at Notre Dame said that Amy was the best student that he ever had. He was there for many years. The best student. So that meant something because academics means something to me. And I’m just, I think it’s going to be really thrilling. I hope it goes smoothly. Perhaps it will, perhaps it won’t. I think it’s going to be very hard to dispute her qualifications or anything about her. Well, I’ve been very happy that the two people that we put on. It’s a very proud moment for a president to make choices. And if you look at Justice Gorsuch, or Justice, Kavanaugh, they’ve been just outstanding people, outstanding men. And it was time for a woman. I think I knew. I mean, there was thought of it last time, but I thought that at that time, Judge Kavanaugh, was Judge, was just very outstanding. And I just felt that this was the right time. I did consider her at that time, but when this happened with Justice Ginsburg, when this happened, this just seemed like a natural fit. No, specifically I didn’t do that because in theory you, it’s nicer if you don’t. I guess you have no, you could talk about anything you want, but I just really got to know her a little bit, a little bit the last time. And when this was happening, in the process of happening, I called her and I said, “I’d like to have you come down.” And it just worked out very quickly and very well. I didn’t discuss certain concepts and certain things. And some people say you shouldn’t, I don’t see any reason why you shouldn’t, but I decided not to do it. And I think it gives her freedom to do what she has to do. She has to make rulings. But I think she’s going to make a lot of people, very proud. There’s also, there has been, I noticed there’s a tremendous clamoring for her. The public really, I’ve been seeing it. We’re all human, and I’ve been seeing it. There was a tremendous feeling that she was somebody that was going to be picked. I didn’t tell anybody, but a lot of people felt she was going to be picked. Right. So I didn’t think it was for me to discuss that with her, because it’s something she’s going to be ruling on. And this is what I was told, although I would have had the right to do that. But if you look at her past actions and rulings, I guess she maybe would be in the category that you mentioned. I don’t know. I can say this, that she is certainly conservative in her views and her rulings. And we’ll have to see how that all works out, but it will work out. It’s certainly possible, and maybe they do it in a different way. Maybe they’d give it back to the states. You just don’t know what’s going to happen. But I’ve been surprised. I’ve been surprised by some of the rulings that we’ve already had over the last year. You think you know somebody and then you get rulings that are a little bit different than you think could happen. So you never know what’s going to happen. Mostly, I’m looking for somebody that can interpret the Constitution as written. We say it all the time. And she is very strong on that. And it will be very interesting. Also our Second Amendment. I feel I know what she’s doing on Second Amendment, but I can’t really speak for her. And again, I’m picking a person. She’s going to have to rule the way she feels. But the Second Amendment is under siege if Joe Biden got in, in any way, if he would have, because I can’t imagine if that’s going to happen, but your Second Amendment is going to be gone. And it’s going to be gone quickly, I think. So we can’t let that happen. But they’ll probably be ruling on Second Amendment and various other things. They say it’s the most important thing a president can do. I don’t know if that’s true. I mean, I would say military. You might agree with me on military protection. But they say the selection of a Supreme Court Justice is the most important thing. And the other thing, by the end of the term, we’ll have almost 300 federal judges and court of appeals judges, which is a record. So we will have had a great impact on the court system going forward. Yeah. It’s such a great question. It’s just, you can’t answer it. But I do believe that in a way, Justice Kavanaugh was a pioneer. What he went through was so horrible. False accusations, and he’s such a gentleman the way he handled it, but nobody was, I don’t think I’ve ever seen anybody for any position treated the way he was treated. And so viciously by Harris and all of them. The way they spoke to this man was so horrible. And I actually think it makes it easier for Amy. I think they can’t do that again. They can never get away with it. Nobody’s ever been treated so badly as Justice Kavanaugh, at that time, Judge Kavanaugh. I will say this, Judge Gorsuch, at the time Judge Gorsuch, he was treated pretty tough. Got through it strongly. He did a great job. But the way Judge Kavanaugh was treated was, I’ve never seen. I’ve never seen anything like it. I’ve seen some bad treatment. I have never seen anything like that. I think that makes it a lot easier for Amy. I don’t know if they can hold back, but I think they don’t look good if they go crazy again. They went crazy. They went, what they did was crazy. And we had a couple of people that weren’t real fighters on our side. And they’re gone. They’re gone. I wonder where they went, but they’re no longer with us, and that’s a good thing. We have, I think we have great, the Republican Party is very united in this. Lindsey Graham, every one of our members, they’re tremendous. Mitch. We speak all the time. Well, we worked very closely together and it’s been pretty amazing. Look, we have, there’s never been anything like it. If you think, again, by the end of, we have 40 or 50, we have many people in there waiting to be confirmed right now for federal judgeships. That’s a big deal. A federal judgeship. And don’t forget, President Obama left us over 100. It’s unheard of. He left us over 100 because he probably thought that Crooked Hillary who was going to win. And in which case it wouldn’t have mattered too much. I guess that’s what he assumed. But he left us a lot. So we will have a record. And that’s a, very record, that’s a very important record. Again, judges and justices, especially justices of the Supreme Court. And to think that I’d have three in one term. Well, the only way they can do that if they win the presidency and they have to win the Senate. And I’ll tell you, I think we’re doing really well. There’s a great hidden majority. I call it hidden, you can call it a silent majority, but it’s not really silent. It’s very, you see the rallies. Our people showed up last night in Virginia. We’re looking at Virginia very strongly. We think Virginia is in play and you saw the people that showed up last night. We had probably 35,000 people show up at an airport on a short notice. So we think there’s a lot of things going on out there that, much more so than even four years ago. Four years ago, you knew it better, you saw it early Pete, but four years ago we had tremendous enthusiasm. It’s much more now. It’s much more this year. I would like to. I would say we have plenty of time, just in case your next question would be, well, should you wait? They wouldn’t wait, number one. And importantly, we have a lot of time. We also could go after. We have tremendous amount of time. And it’s been done many times before this way. It’s an election year. No, I think we’re going to have it done easily before the election. I think it would be nice to do, get it out of the way. It’s so important a decision. I think it’s important. We’re going to try to have it done quickly and before the election. But think of all the time. So then you have, from that day, you have all the way to January 20th. So I mean, who would not do this? They say, well, why don’t you wait for the next? Well, elections have consequences. And we won the election. We have the Senate. We have the presidency. So I think, I think she’ll be confirmed before, and probably long before the election, relatively long before the election. I think I prepare every day. I think when you’re President, you sort of see everything that they’re going to be asking and they may disagree with you, but we’ve done a great job. We created the greatest economy in history and there’s never been, from an employment standpoint, from every standpoint, and now it’s coming back. We closed it. We saved millions and millions of lives by doing what I did. And now we’re bringing it back. It’s a V. It’s a V-shape, which is, it’s maxed out. I mean, we’re setting records on employment and everything else. Even the stock market. Look how high the stock market is. And we’re rounding the turn. They hate when I say that, the opposition, but we are. We’re rounding the turn on the pandemic. And very incredibly, we have some of the great vaccines, great companies, and we’re going to have different vaccines, very powerful vaccines, great vaccines and therapeutics, but this is all happening very, very soon. So we’re in great shape, but we built the greatest economy in history, and now we’re doing it again. We’re doing it rapidly. And I think next year, we’re going to have a great third quarter, by the way. And next year I think is going to be one of the greatest years we’ve ever had on the economy. And it’s going to, it’s really very exciting, actually. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Pete.
















"
"72","09-28-20","Thank you very much, thank you. So beautiful out here. And thank you for joining us as we announce a massive and groundbreaking expansion in our testing capability for the China virus. And as you know, it’s already setting records, records like nobody’s ever seen before. Last week, we crossed a historic milestone when the United States conducted our 100 millionth test, far more than any other country and not even close actually, second seems to be India with one point five billion people. And the numbers would be probably at least 50 million more tests by us. We’ve conducted more tests than the entire European Union. And more than all of Latin America combined. We’re thrilled to be joined by Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of Health and Human Services, Alex Azar, Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos, hi Betsy. Administrator for the Centers for Medicine and Medicaid Services, Seema Verma, Seema, and Admiral Giroir, who’s done such an incredible job, thank you, Admiral. We’re also joined by Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves, had a tremendous victory, we’re so proud of you. And as well by Abbott’s CEO, Robert Ford, Robert, thank you very much, great job. Today I’m pleased to report that we’re announcing our plan to distribute 150 million Abbott rapid point-of-care tests in the coming weeks, very, very soon. This will be more than double the number of tests already performed and here’s our plan. 50 million tests will go to protect the most vulnerable communities, which we’ve always promised to do, including 18 million for nursing homes, 15 million for assisted living facilities, 10 million for home health and hospiece care, hospice care agencies, and nearly one million for Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and also tribal nation colleges. 100 million rapid point-of-care tests will be given to states and territories to support efforts to reopen their economies and schools immediately and fast as they can. For example, the support my administration is providing would allow every state to, on a very regular basis, test every teacher who needs it. This continues our critical effort to use testing to protect high-risk communities. These new Abbott rapid point-of-care tests are easy to use and return results within just minutes. You’ll have a result at a maximum 15 minutes, no machine is required to process them. So in the old days, when we just started this, you remember we’d go out and we’d have to find these massive laboratories with tremendously expensive equipment. Now we’re down to something that you’ll see that is really from a different planet. I would like to ask Admiral Giroir to come up and demonstrate how these tests are performed. You’ll do this very nicely, I think. Good luck, hope you don’t test positive. Thank you very much, Admiral, and let me ask you Governor Reeves, do you agree, would you like to say something? Thank you very much, thank you Tate, great job. In a short period of time, my administration has built the most advanced testing system in the world. There’s never been anything like this. When the pandemic struck, there were zero tests for the China virus, but we’ve marshaled all of America’s resources to achieve these unparalleled capabilities. We slashed red tape and approved emergency use authorizations for 243 type of tests. That’s how many tests we have. I invoked the Defense Production Act and related authorities more than 100 times and distributed $171 million to expand testing production. We’ve done nearly twice as much testing per capita as France, Italy, and Germany. And over six times more testing per capita than South Korea. We’ve done far more than any other country, usually times two, three, four, five, or six. We’ve performed nearly 40 million more tests than India. And by the end of next month, we will have over 100 million tests available in the market. More than half will be point-of-care tests. Those are the quick ones, and they’re really the ones that have the best impact, with the results in less than 15 minutes. We’ve also prioritized resources for the most vulnerable, including nursing home residents. We delivered rapid testing devices to nearly 14,000 certified nursing homes. We opened over 1,000 community testing sites in low-income communities. Nobody could have done this. We invested an unprecedented eight billion dollars to help tribal communities have the tests and resources they need to combat the virus. And it’s important to remember that as younger and healthier people return to work, and as we massively increased testing capacity, we will identify more cases and asymptomatic individuals in low-risk populations. This should not cause undue alarm, the total number of cases is not the full metric of success. Hospitalization capacity and mortality rates are far more instructive metrics. As we do more tests, you’re going to have automatically more cases. We are relentlessly focused on protecting the vulnerable while enabling healthy Americans to go back to work. We can do both as Florida, Arizona, and other states have recently shown. Over the last eight weeks hospitalizations have declined by 48% and they’ve just reached the lowest point since March, that’s a long time ago. Due to advances in treatment, the fatality rate has fallen 85% since April. Our excess mortality has been considerably lower than comparable countries. Excess mortality compares total deaths during a pandemic to what we would be expected in a normal year. This is a critical measurement because it includes undetected China virus deaths, along with deaths resulting from lockdowns, and lockdowns can be very harmful. And we have too many states that are locked down right now, the governors are … nobody knows what the governors are doing actually. Europe has experienced a 50% greater excess mortality rate during the virus than the U.S. and their economic contraction has been far more severe. Under Operation Warp Speed, my administration’s on track to deliver a safe and effective vaccine in record time. We’re doing very well with the vaccines as most of you know. Four vaccines are now in the final stage of trials. The day the vaccine is approved by the F.D.A., we’ll begin distributing it within 24 hours with hundreds of millions of doses to follow very quickly. We’re all set to go. We’re all ready and logistically we have the military lined up and some incredible people are just waiting to have it. Over 100 million doses will be available before the end of the year. We will defeat the virus and we’ll end the pandemic. And next year will be one of the greatest years in our history, and we think it’s going to be a very exciting period of time. With that, I’d like to ask Mike to say a few words, because you just left a Task Force meeting, Vice President Mike Pence. Thank you very much, Mike. Scott Atlas, would you say a few words please, as to how we’re doing and where you see us going, please? Well, thank you very much. Tremendous progress is being made and I say it and I’ll say it all the time, we’re rounding the corner. And very importantly vaccines are coming, but we’re rounding the corner regardless, but vaccines are coming and they’re coming fast. We have four great companies already, and it’s going be added to very rapidly. They’re in final stages of testing. And from what we’re hearing, the results are going to be very extraordinary. So thank you very much, I appreciate it. And thank you very much, great job by Abbott, right from the beginning, great job by Abbott. Thank you, thank you very much everybody, thank you.
















"
"73","09-29-20","How are you doing? Thank you very much, Chris. I will tell you very simply. We won the election. Elections have consequences. We have the Senate, we have the White House, and we have a phenomenal nominee respected by all. Top, top academic, good in every way. Good in every way. In fact, some of her biggest endorsers are very liberal people from Notre Dame and other places. So I think she’s going to be fantastic. We have plenty of time. Even if we did it after the election itself. I have a lot of time after the election, as you know. So I think that she will be outstanding. She’s going to be as good as anybody that has served on that court. We really feel that. We have a professor at Notre Dame, highly respected by all, said she’s the single greatest student he’s ever had. He’s been a professor for a long time at a great school. And we won the election and therefore we have the right to choose her, and very few people knowingly would say otherwise. And by the way, the Democrats, they wouldn’t even think about not doing it. The only difference is they’d try and do it faster. There’s no way they would give it up. They had Merrick Garland, but the problem is they didn’t have the election so they were stopped. And probably that would happen in reverse, also. Definitely would happen in reverse. So we won the election and we have the right to do it, Chris. Thank you, Joe. There aren’t a hundred million people with pre-existing conditions. As far as a say is concerned, the people already had their say. Okay, Justice Ginsburg said very powerfully, very strongly, at some point 10 years ago or so, she said a President and the Senate is elected for a period of time, but a President is elected for four years. We’re not elected for three years. I’m not elected for three years. So we have the Senate, we have a President-During that period of time, during that period of time, we have an opening. I’m not elected for three years. I’m elected for four years. Joe, the hundred million people is totally wrong. I don’t know where you got that number. The bigger problem that you have is that you’re going to extinguish 180 million people with their private health care, that they’re very happy this. Well, you’re certainly going to socialist. You’re going to socialist medicine-That's not what you've said and it's not what your party is saying. Your party doesn't say it. Your party wants to go socialist medicine and socialist healthcare. And they're going to nominate you, Joe. You know that. Not according to Harris. Joe, you’ve had 308,000 military people dying because you couldn’t provide them proper healthcare in the military. So don’t tell me about this. And if you were here, it wouldn’t be 200, it would be two million people because you were very late on the draw. You didn’t want me to ban China, which was heavily infected. You didn’t want me to ban Europe. You would have been much later, Joe, much later. We're talking about two million people. You don’t know what’s on the ballot. Why is it on the ballot? Why is it on the ballot? It’s not on the ballot. I don't think so. There's nothing happening here. You don’t know her view on Roe V. Wade? You don’t know here view. That's right. Because they want to give good healthcare. Yes, I have. Of course, I have. The individual mandate. Excuse me. I got rid of the individual mandate, which was a big chunk of Obamacare. That is absolutely a big thing. That was the worst part of Obamacare. Chris, that was the worst part of Obamacare. Well, I’ll ask Joe. The individual mandate was the most unpopular aspect of Obamacare. I got rid of it. And we will protect people. Go ahead. Well, first of all, I guess I’m debating you, not him, but that’s okay. I’m not surprised. Let me just tell you something. There’s nothing symbolic. I’m cutting drug prices. I’m going with Favored Nations, which no President has the courage to do because you’re going against big pharma. Drug prices will be coming down 80 or 90%. You could have done it during your 47 year period in government, but you didn’t do it. Nobody’s done it. So we’re cutting healthcare. All of the things we've done. I’ll give you an example. Insulin, it was destroying families, destroying people, the cost. I’m getting it for so cheap it’s like water, you want to know the truth. So cheap. Take a look at all of the drugs that what we’re doing. Prescription drug prices, we’re going to allow our Governors now to go to other countries to buy drugs because when they paid just a tiny fraction of what we do. This is big stuff. That's not what your party says, by the way. Joe, you agreed with Bernie Sanders, who’s far left, on the manifesto, we call it. And that gives you socialized medicine. Are you saying you didn't agree? Not by much. Not by much. If Pocahontas would have left two days early you would have lost every primary. On Super Tuesday, you got very lucky. With what? With what? But you agree. Joe, you’re the liar. You graduated last in your class not first in your class. You'd be surprised. You'd be surprised. Go ahead, Joe. Listen, you agreed with Bernie Sanders and the manifesto. He just lost the left. You just lost the left. You agreed with Bernie Sanders on a plan that you absolutely agreed to and under that plan [crosstalk 00:15:10], they call it socialized medicine. Who is, Bernie? No, I want to give them better healthcare at a much lower price, because Obamacare is no good. I've already fixed it. We’ve already fixed it to an extent. Obamacare, as you might know but probably don’t, Obamacare is no good. Obamacare is no good. We made it better and I had a choice to make very early on. We took away the individual mandate. We guaranteed pre-existing conditions, but took away the individual mandate. Listen, this is the way it is. And that destroyed … They shouldn’t even call it Obamacare, then I had a choice to make, do I let my people run it really well or badly? If I run it badly, they’ll probably blame him, but they’ll blame me. But more importantly, I want to help people. Okay. I said, “You’ve got to run it so well.” And I just had a meeting with them. They said the problem is, no matter how well you run Obamacare, it’s a disaster. It’s too expensive. Premiums are too high, that it doesn’t work. So we do want to get rid of it. Chris, we want to get rid of that and give something that’s cheaper and better. Go ahead. Good. Of course, we do. Are you going to pack the court? Are you going to pack the court? He doesn't want to answer the question. Why wouldn’t you answer that question? You want to put a lot of new Supreme Court Justices. Radical left. Listen, who is on your list, Joe? Who's on your list? He's going to pack the court. He is not going to give a list. The people understand, Joe. 47 years, you've done nothing. They understand. Wrong. Wrong. It's so wrong. So, if we would have listened to you. If we would’ve listened to you, the country would have been left wide open, millions of people would have died, not 200,000. And one person is too much. It’s China’s fault. It should have never happened. They stopped it from going in, but it was China’s fault. And, by the way, when you talk about numbers, you don’t know how many people died in China. You don’t know how many people died in Russia. You don’t know how many people died in India. They don’t exactly give you a straight count, just so you understand. But if you look at what we’ve done, I closed it and you said, “He’s xenophobic. He’s a racist and he’s xenophobic,” because you didn’t think I should have closed our country. Wait a minute. You didn’t think we should have closed our country because you thought it was terrible. You wouldn’t have closed it for another two months. By my doing it early, in fact, Dr. Fauci said, “President Trump saved thousands of lives.” Many of your Democrat Governors said, “President Trump did a phenomenal job.” We worked with the Governor. Oh really, go take a look. The Governors said I did a phenomenal job. Most of them said that. In fact, people that would not be necessarily on my side said that, “President Trump did a phenomenal job.” We did. We got the gowns. We got the masks. We made the ventilators. You wouldn’t have made ventilators. And now we’re weeks away from a vaccine. We’re doing therapeutics already. Fewer people are dying when they get sick. Far fewer people are dying. We’ve done a great job. The only thing I haven’t done a good job, and that’s because of the fake news, no matter what you say to them, they give you a bad press on it. It’s just fake news. They give you good press, they give me bad press because that’s the way it is, unfortunately. But let me just say something. I don’t care. I’ve gotten used to it. But I’ll tell you, Joe, you could never have done the job that we did. You don’t have it in your blood. You could’ve never done that, Joe. Well, you didn’t do very well in Swine Flu. H1-N1, you were a disaster. Your own Chief of Staff said you were a disaster. A far less lethal disease, by the way. We would have lost far more people, far more people. You would have been months late. You’re months behind me, Joe. You don't trust Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer? Well, I’ve spoken to the companies and we can have it a lot sooner. It’s a very political thing because people like this would rather make it political than save lives. It is a very political thing. I’ve spoken to Pfizer, I’ve spoken to all of the people that you have to speak to, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, and others. They can go faster than that by a lot. It’s become very political because the left… Or I don’t know if I call them left, I don’t know what I call them. I disagree with him. No, I disagree with both of them. And he didn’t say that. He said it could be there, but it could also be much sooner. I had him in my office two days ago. Because he said it’s a possibility that we’ll have the answer before November 1st. It could also be after that. Well, we’re going to deliver it right away. We have the military all set up. Logistically, they’re all set up. We have our military that delivers soldiers and they can do 200,000 a day. They’re going to be delivering-It's all set up. That was said sarcastically, and you know that. That was said sarcastically. You'll have the vaccine sooner than that. We spoke to the scientists that are in charge-they will have the vaccine very soon. Did you use the word smart? So you said you went to Delaware State, but you forgot the name of your college. You didn’t go to Delaware State. You graduated either the lowest or almost the lowest in your class. Don’t ever use the word smart with me. Don’t ever use that word. Because you know what? There’s nothing smart about you, Joe. 47 years you’ve done nothing. Let me just tell you something, Joe. If you would have had the charge of what I was put through, I had to close the greatest economy of the history of our country. And by the way, now it’s being built again and it’s going up fast. Okay. It's going up fast. I look forward to talking about it. Tell that to Nancy Pelosi. Tell that to Nancy Pelosi, and Chuck Schumer. You probably play more than I do, Joe. Well, he wants to shut down this country and I want to keep it open, and we did a great thing by shutting it down-Wait a minute, Joe. Let me shut you down for a second, Joe, just for one second. He wants to shut down the country. We just went through it. We had to, because we didn’t know anything about the disease. Now we’ve found that elderly people with heart problems and diabetes and different problems are very, very vulnerable. We learned a lot. Young children aren’t, even younger people aren’t. We’ve learned a lot, but he wants to shut it down. More people will be hurt by continuing. If you look at Pennsylvania, if you look at certain states that have been shut down, they have Democrat governors, all, one of the reasons they shut down is because they want to keep it shut down until after the election on November 3rd. Because it's a political thing. But those states-Those states are not doing well that are shut down right now. He wants to shut down the entire country. No, I think masks are okay. You have to understand, if you look… I mean, I have a mask right here. I put a mask on when I think I need it. Tonight, as an example, everybody’s had a test and you’ve had social distancing and all of the things that you have to, but I wear masks-when needed. When needed, I wear masks. I don’t wear a mask like him. Every time you see him, he’s got a mask. He could be speaking 200 feet away from him and he shows up with the biggest mask I’ve ever seen. I will say this-And they've also said the opposite. They've also said-Dr. Fauci. Dr. Fauci said the opposite. He said very strongly, “Masks are not good.” Then he changed his mind. He said, “Masks are good.” I'm okay with masks. I'm not fighting masks. Outside. Because nobody will show up. Well, it's true. Nobody shows up to his rallies. Because people want to hear what I have to say. I mean-I’m doing my job as a president, and I’ll have 25, 35,000 people show up at airports. We use airports and hangers and we have a lot of people-Well, so far we have had no problem whatsoever. It’s outside. That’s a big difference according to the experts. We do them outside, we have tremendous crowds, as you see, and literally on 24 hours notice. And Joe does the circles and has three people someplace. We've had no negative effect. We’ve had no negative effect, and we’ve had 35, 40,000 people at these rallies. If you could get the crowds, you would have done the same thing. But you can’t. Nobody cares. No cares. Yes. Much faster. So we built the greatest economy in history. We closed it down because of the China plague. When the plague came in, we closed it down, which was very hard psychologically to do. He didn’t think we should close it down and he was wrong. Again, two million people would be dead now instead of… Still, 204,000 people is too much. One person is too much. Should have never happened from China. But what happened is we closed it down and now we’re reopening and we’re doing record business. We had 10.4 million people in a four month period that we’ve put back into the workforce. That’s a record the likes of which nobody’s ever seen before. And he wants to close down the… He will shut it down again. He will destroy this country. A lot of people, between drugs and alcohol and depression, when you start shutting it down, you take a look at what’s happening at some of your Democrat-run states where they have these tough shutdowns. And I’m telling you it’s because they don’t want to open it. One of them came out last week, you saw that, “Oh, we’re going to open up on November 9th.” Why November 9th? Because it’s after the election. They think they’re hurting us by keeping them closed. They’re hurting people. People know what to do. They can social distance. They can wash their hands, they can wear masks. They can do whatever they want, but they got to open these states up. When you look at North Carolina, when you look, and these governors are under siege, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and a couple of others, you got to open these states up. It’s not fair. You’re talking about almost it’s like being in prison. And you look at what’s going on with divorce, look at what’s going on with alcoholism and drugs. It’s a very, very sad thing. And he’ll close down the whole country. This guy will close down the whole country and destroy our country. Our country is coming back incredibly well, setting records as it does it. We don’t need somebody to come in and say, “Let’s shut it down.” That's wrong. I have to respond to that. Excuse me, he made a statement. No, people want their schools open. They don’t want to be shut down. They don’t want their state shut down. They want their restaurants. I look at New York. It’s so sad what’s happening in New York. It’s almost like a ghost town, and I’m not sure it can ever recover what they’ve done to New York. People want their places open. They want to get back to their lives. They'll be careful, but they want their schools open. I’m the one that brought back football. By the way, I brought back Big Ten football. It was me and I’m very happy to do it-and people of Ohio are very proud of me. And you know how I found out? When I paid millions of dollars in taxes, millions of dollars of income tax. And let me just tell you, there was a story in one of the papers that paid-I paid $38 million one year, I paid $27 million one year. You’ll see it as soon as it’s finished, you’ll see it. You know, if you wanted to, go to the Board of Elections. There’s 118 page or so report that says everything I have, every bank I have, I’m totally under leveraged because the assets are extremely good, and I built a great company. But let me tell you-Let me-Millions of dollars. Millions of dollars, yes. Millions of dollars. And you'll get to see it. And you'll get to see it. But let me just tell you-Chris, let me just say something, that it was the tax laws. I don’t want to pay tax. Before I came here, I was a private developer, I was a private business people. Like every other private person, unless they’re stupid, they go through the laws, and that’s what it is. He passed a tax bill that gave us all these privileges for depreciation and for tax credits. We build the building and we get tax credits, like the hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue. Which by the way, was given to me by the Obama administration, if you can believe that. Now the man got fired right after that happened, but that’s-That's okay. But why didn't you do it over the last 25 years? Why didn't you do it over the last 25 years? You were a Senator and-Hey Joe, let me just tell you, Joe. In 47 months, I’ve done more than you’ve done in 47 years, Joe. We’ve done things that you never even thought of doing. Including fixing the broken military that you gave me, including taking care of your debts. He has none. Why didn’t you do it before, when you were vice president with Obama? I got it done. And you know what happened? Our economy boomed like it's never boomed before. Excuse me. They had the slowest economic recovery since 1929. It was the slowest recovery. Also, they took over something that was down here. All you had to do is turn on the lights and you pick up a lot. But they had the slowest economic recovery since 1929, and let me tell you about the stock market. When the stock market goes up, that means jobs. It also means 401ks. If you got in, if you ever became president with your ideas, you want to terminate my taxes. I’ll tell you what, you’ll lose. Half of the companies that have poured in here will leave. And plenty of companies that are already here, they’ll leave for other places. [crosstalk 00:20:25] They will leave and you will have a depression, the likes of which you’ve never seen. It wasn't blooming. He was in booming. It was the weakest recovery since 1929. When COVID came along. Excuse me, Chris, wait. Chris. They said it would take-No you're on number two. Chris, Chris. They said it would take-a miracle to bring back manufacturing. I brought back 700,000 jobs. They brought back nothing. They gave up on manufacturing-standard fare. He totally gave up on manufacturing. Ohio had the best year it’s ever had last year. Michigan had the best year they’ve ever had. Many car companies came in from Germany, from Japan, went to Michigan, went to Ohio and they didn’t come in with you. China ate your lunch, Joe. And no wonder your son goes in and he takes out billions of dollars. He takes out billions of dollars to manage. He makes millions of dollars. And also, while we’re at it, why is it just out of curiosity, the mayor of Moscow’s wife gave you a son three and a half million dollars? What did he do to deserve it? What did he do with-to deserve $183,000? Oh really, he didn't get three and a half million? Well wait, he didn't get three and a half million dollars, Joe? He got three and a half million-dollars. Oh, really? It's a fact. Did Burisma pay him 183,000 a month, with no experience in energy? I think he did. By who? The media. By the media, because they refuse to talk about it-because they're embarrassed. So let me ask you this, Joe-He got three and a half million dollars from Moscow. Oh, really? I'd like to know who they are. I'll fire them. Some people don't do a good job. Hey, let me just tell you, Joe-Three and a half million, Joe. Why did he deserve three and a half million from Moscow? My family-My family lost a fortune by coming down and helping us with governance. Every single one of them lost a fortune. Chris, can I be honest? It's a very important question-He stood up-and he threatened Ukraine-with a billion dollars-Well, and him too. Well, that's all right, but he does plenty. He does plenty. Oh yeah, sure. That's true. So-You did a crime bill, 1994, where you call them super predators. African-Americans are super predators and they’ve never forgotten it. They’ve never forgotten it. So you did that and they call you a super predator and I’m letting people out of jail now, that you have treated the African-American population community, you have treated the black community about as bad as anybody in this country. You did the 1990… And that’s why, if you look at the polls, I’m doing better than any Republican has done in a long time, because they saw what you did. You call them super predators, and you’ve called them worse than that. Because you look back at your testimony over the years, you’ve called them a lot worse than that. As far as the church is concerned and as far as the generals are concerned, we just got the support of 250 military leaders and generals, total support. Law enforcement, almost every law enforcement group in the United States. I have Florida. I have Texas. I have Ohio. I have every… Excuse me, Portland, the sheriff just came out today and he said, “I support President Trump.” I don’t think you have any law enforcement. You can’t even say the word law enforcement. Because if you say those words, you’re going to lose all of your radical left supporters. And why aren’t you saying those words, Joe? Why don’t you say the words law enforcement? Because you know what? If called us in Portland, we would put out that fire in a half an hour. But they won’t do it, because they’re run by radical left Democrats. If you look at Chicago, if you look at any place you want to look, Seattle, they heard we were coming in the following day and they put up their hands and we got back Seattle. Minneapolis, we got it back, Joe, because we believe in law and order, but you don’t. The top 10 cities and just about the top 40 cities are run by Democrats, and in many cases radical left. And they’ve got you wrapped around their finger, Joe, to a point where you don’t want to say anything about law and order. And I’ll tell you what, the people of this country want and demand law and order and you’re afraid to even say it. What is peaceful protest? When they run through the middle of the town-and burn down your stores and kill people all over the place-No it's not, but you say it is. Fine. I ended it because it’s racist. I ended it because a lot of people were complaining that they were asked to do things that were absolutely insane. That it a radical revolution that was taking place in our military, in our schools, all over the place. And you know it, and so does everybody else. And he would know it-If you were a certain person, you had no status in life. It was sort of a reversal. And if you look at the people, we were paying people hundreds of thousands of dollars to teach very bad ideas and frankly, very sick ideas. And really, they were teaching people to hate our country And I’m not going to do that. I’m not going to allow that to happen. We have to go back to the core values of this country. They were teaching people that our country is a horrible place. It’s a racist place. And they were teaching people to hate our country. And I’m not going to allow that to happen. You just don't know. During the Obama-Biden administration, there was tremendous division. There was hatred. You look at Ferguson, you look at, or you go to very… Many places, look at Oakland. Look what happened in Oakland. Look what happened in Baltimore. Look what happened… Frankly, it was more violent than what I’m even seeing now. But the reason-is that the Democrats that run these cities-don't want to talk, like you, about law and order. And you still haven’t mentioned. Are you in favor of law and order? Are you in favor of law and order? Okay. It went down much more in ours. The places we had trouble were democratic run cities-I think as a party issue, you can bring in a couple of examples but if you look at Chicago, what’s going on in Chicago where a 53 people were shot and eight died shot, if you look at New York where it’s going up, like nobody’s ever seen anything. The numbers are going up a 100%, 150%, 200% crime, it is crazy what’s going on and he doesn’t want to say law and order because he can’t because he’ll lose his radical left supporters and once he does that, it’s over with. But if he ever got to run this country and they ran it the way he would want to run it, we would have by the way our suburbs would be gone. And you would see problems like you’ve never seen before. Oh, I know suburbs so much that you. That’s not what they are talking about this. That’s not what it is about. He’s talking about defunding the police. He doesn't have any law support. He has no law enforcement. He has almost nothing. Oh, really, who do you have name one group that supports you name one group that came out and supported you. Go ahead. Think we have time. No, no think right now. Name one law enforcement group that came out in support of you. There aren't any. He's never done that. Oh really? I sent in the US Marshalls to get the killer of a young man in the middle of the street and they shot him for three days Portland didn’t do anything. I sent in the US Marshals they took care of business. I don't know who said that. Who? I don't think she said that. I don't think so. Does it mean I have to answer his stuff. Wait a second, you have made a statement. I would love to end it. I’ll send in the National Guard, it would be over. That’d be no problem. But I don’t want to accept the National Guard. Sure, I'm willing to do that. I would say almost everything I see is from the left wing not from the right wing. I'm willing to do anything. I want to see peace. What do you want to call them? Give me a name, give me a name, go ahead who do you want me to condemn. Proud Boys, stand back and stand by. But I’ll tell you what somebody’s got to do something about Antifa and the left because this is not a right wing problem this is a left wing…Oh you got to be kidding me. Well, then you know what, he's wrong. Antifa is bad. You know what, Antifa is a dangerous radical group. And you ought to be careful of them, they'll overthrow you. Because there is never been an administration or president who has done more than I’ve done in a period of three and a half years. And that’s despite the impeachment hoax and you so what happened today with Hillary Clinton, where it was a whole big con job. But despite going through all of these things where I had a fight, both flanks and behind me and above there has never been an administration that’s done what I’ve done. The greatest, before COVID came in the greatest economy in history, lowest unemployment numbers, everything was good. Everything was going. And by the way, there was unity going to happen. People were calling me for the first time in years, they were calling and they were saying it’s time maybe and then what happened? We got hit. But now we’re building it back up again. A rebuilding of the military, including Space Force and all of the other things. A fixing of the VA which was a mess under him, 308,000 people died because they didn’t have proper health care. It was a mess. And we now got a 91% approval rating at the VA, our vets. We take care of our vets. But we’ve rebuilt our military. And I’ll tell you something, some people say maybe the most important by the end of the first term I’ll have approximately 300 Federal judges and Court of Appeals judges, 300 and hopefully three great Supreme Court judges, justices that is a record the likes of which very few people and one of the reasons I’ll have so many judges because President Obama and him left me 128 judges to fill. When you leave office, you don’t leave any judges. That’s like, you just don’t do that. They left 128 openings and if I were a member of his party, because they have a little different philosophy, I’d say, if you left us 128 openings you can’t be a good president. You can’t be a good vice president but I want to thank you because it gives us almost, it’ll probably be above that number. By the end of this term, 300 judges. It’s a record. Your son got three and a half million dollars. Really? Are you talking Hunter, are you talking about Hunter. I don’t know Beau. I know Hunter. Hunter got thrown out of the military. He was thrown out dishonorably discharged. For cocaine use. And he didn’t have a job until you became vice president. Once you became vice president he made a fortune in Ukraine, in China, in Moscow and various other places. He made a fortune and he didn't have a job. But why was he given tens of millions of dollars? I know but when somebody gets three and a half million dollars from the Mayor of Moscow. Why did he get it? I want crystal clean water and air. I want beautiful clean air. We have now the lowest carbon… If you look at our numbers right now, we are doing phenomenally. But I haven’t destroyed our businesses. Our businesses aren’t put out of commission. If you look at the Paris Accord, it was a disaster from our standpoint. And people are actually very happy about what’s going on because our businesses are doing well. As far as the fires are concerned, you need forest management. In addition to everything else, the forest floors are loaded up with trees, dead trees that are years old and they’re like tinder and leaves and everything else. You drop a cigarette in there the whole forest burns down. You’ve got to have forest management. I believe that we have to do everything we can to have immaculate air immaculate water and do whatever else we can that’s good. We’re planting a billion trees, the Billion Tree Project and it’s very exciting for a lot of people. I think a lot of things do, but I think to an extent, yes. I think to an extent, yes, but I also think we have to do better management of our forest. Every year I get the call. California’s burning, California’s burning. If that was cleaned, if that were, if you had forest management, good forest management, you wouldn’t be getting those calls. In Europe, they live they’re forest cities. They call forest cities. They maintain their forest. They manage their forest. I was with the head of a major country, it’s a forest city. He said, “Sir, we have trees that are far more, they ignite much easier than California. There shouldn’t be that problem.” I spoke with the Governor about it. I’m getting along very well with the governor. But I said, “At some point you can’t every year have hundreds of thousands of acres of land just burned to the ground.” That’s burning down because of a lack of management. Because it was driving energy prices through the sky. Well, not really because what’s happening is the car is much less expensive and it’s a much safer car and you talk it about a tiny difference. And then what would happen because of the cost of the car you would have at least double and triple the number of cars purchased. We have the old slugs out there that are 10, 12 years old. If you did that, the car would be safer. It would be much cheaper by $3,500. No, but you would take a lot of cars off the market because people would be able to afford a car. Now, by the way, we’re going to see how that turns out. But a lot of people agree with me, many people. The car has gotten so expensive because they have computers all over the place for an extra little bit of gasoline. And I’m okay with electric cars too. I think I’m all for electric cars. I’ve given big incentives for electric cars but what they’ve done in California is just crazy. Not true. Not true-He’s talking about the Green New Deal. And it’s not 2 billion [crosstalk 00:55:45] or 20 billion, as you said [crosstalk 00:55:46]. It’s $100 trillion. And rebuild the building. It's the dumbest-most ridiculous where two car systems are out-where they want to take out the cows too. That's not true either, right? This is a 100 trillion-That's more money than our country could make in 100 years-100 million dollars. I never said that at all-They made it up. You make up a lot-Wait a minut, Chris. So why didn't he do it for 47 years? You were vice president-So why didn’t you get the world… China sends up real dirt into the air. Russia does. India does. They all do. We’re supposed to be good. And by the way, he made a couple of statements. The Green New Deal is a hundred trillion dollars. He made a statement about the military. He said I said something about the military. He and his friends made it up, and then they went with it. I never said it. He called the military stupid bastards. He said it on tape. I would never say that. You're on tape-Oh, you don't? Oh, well, that's a big statement. You just lost the radical left. So when I listen to Joe talking about a transition, there has been no transition from when I won. I won that election. And if you look at crooked Hillary Clinton, if you look at all of the different people, there was no transition, because they came after me trying to do a coup. They came after me spying on my campaign. They started from the day I won, and even before I won. From the day I came down the escalator with our first lady, they were a disaster. They were a disgrace to our country, and we’ve caught them. We’ve caught them all. We’ve got it all on tape. We’ve caught them all. And by the way, you gave the idea for the Logan Act against General Flynn. You better take a look at that, because we caught you in a sense, and President Obama was sitting in the office. He knew about it too. So don’t tell me about a free transition. As far as the ballots are concerned, it’s a disaster. A solicited ballot, okay, solicited, is okay. You’re soliciting. You’re asking. They send it back. You send it back. I did that. If you have an unsolicited… They’re sending millions of ballots all over the country. There’s fraud. They found them in creeks. They found some, just happened to have the name Trump just the other day in a wastepaper basket. They’re being sent all over the place. They sent two in a Democrat area. They sent out a thousand ballots. Everybody got two ballots. This is going to be a fraud like you’ve never seen. The other thing, it’s nice. On November 3rd, you’re watching, and you see who won the election. And I think we’re going to do well because people are really happy with the job we’ve done. But you know what? We won’t know. We might not know for months because these ballots are going to be all over. Take a look at what happened in Manhattan. Take a look at what happened in New Jersey. Take a look at what happened in Virginia and other places. They’re not losing 2%, 1%, which by the way is too much. An election could be won or lost with that. They’re losing 30 and 40%. It’s a fraud, and it’s a shame. And can you imagine where they say, “You have to have your ballot in by November 10th.” November 10th. That’s seven days after the election, in theory, should have been announced. We have major states [crosstalk 01:03:58] with that-all run by Democrats-All run by Democrats. It's a rigged election. Yeah. I think I’m counting on them to look at the ballots, definitely. I hope we don’t need them, in terms of the election itself. But for the ballots, I think so, because what’s happening is incredible. I read today where at least 1% of the ballots for 2016 were invalidated. They take them. We don’t like them. We don’t like them. They throw them out-left and right. What you do is you go and vote. You do a solicited ballot, and that’s okay-You go and vote. You go and vote-You either do, Chris, a solicited ballot, where you’re sending it in, they’re sending it back and you’re sending. They have mailmen with lots of it. Did you see what’s going on? Take a look at West Virginia, mailman selling the ballots. They’re being sold. They’re being dumped in rivers. This is a horrible thing for our country. This is not going to end well. This is not going to end well. You're wrong. You're wrong. I love counting the votes. Chris, he's so wrong when he makes a statement like that-Excuse me. You know it can't be done. You know it can't, and already, there's been fraud-could be months-I’m urging my supporters to go in to the polls and watch very carefully, because that’s what has to happen. I am urging them to do it. As you know, today there was a big problem. In Philadelphia, they went in to watch. They’re called poll watchers, a very safe, very nice thing. They were thrown out. They weren’t allowed to watch. You know why? Because bad things happen in Philadelphia. Bad things. And I am urging my people. I hope it’s going to be a fair election. If it’s a fair election-I am 100% on board. But if I see tens of thousands of ballots being manipulated, I can’t go along with that. And I’ll tell you why-from a common sense-I'll tell you what it means-It means you have a fraudulent election. You’re sending out 80 million ballots-They’re not equipped… These people aren’t equipped to handle it, number one. Number two, they cheat. They cheat. Hey, they found ballots in a wastepaper basket three days ago, and they all had the name military ballots. There were military. They all had the name Trump on them. You think that's good? It’s already been established. Take a look at Carolyn Maloney’s race-I want to see an honest ballot cut-I want to see an honest ballot count. And I think he does too.

"74","09-30-20","Hello, everybody. Hello, Duluth. Hello, Duluth. Thank you. Thirty-four days from now, we’re going to win Minnesota. We’re going to go and win four more beautiful years in the White House and do more than anybody’s ever done before from the White House. We’re looking to set records. I really enjoyed last night’s debate with Sleepy Joe. I brought those hats out here because Minnesota is a little on the windy side. Like a genius, I sent them all out, and I’m getting blown to fishes, then that’s fine. That’s okay. I love it. I love you to have whatever we have. We have it together, that I can tell you. The verdict is in and they say that we, we, all of us, won big last night. I don’t know. Did you hear about this? In the history of cable television, it had the highest ratings of any show in the history of cable television. It had the second highest ratings of overall television in the history of television. Does anybody know what was first? Like M*A*S*H or something? I guess M*A*S*H, they had the final episode of M*A*S*H, and I don’t know what was first. Does anybody know? But we were second in the history of all of television, but the biggest ratings in the history of cable television. It’s an honor. Last night, I did want the corrupt media has refused to do. I held Joe Biden accountable for his 47 years of lie, 47 years of betrayal, and 47 years of failure. I held Joe accountable for shipping your jobs and dreams abroad, and for bowing to the violent mob at home. Can you imagine these people the way they take over these Democrats cities? I don’t even believe it. The whole nation saw the truth. Did you see last night, name one, I said, “Sleepy Joe, name one law enforcement group that supports you.” Then, Chris Wallace says, “Don’t do that.” Can you believe this guy? I was debating two people last night. Joe Biden is too weak to lead this country. You know Biden lost badly when his supporters are saying he should cancel the rest of the debates. Now, I understand he’s canceling the debates. Let’s see what happens. I think that’s not going to be a good move. I don’t think that’s going to be a good move. Television, with those ratings, they’re never going to let them cancel. You don’t know television like that. What are they going to do? Someday, we’re not going to be doing this anymore. What are they going to do without Trump? What are they going to do? Those poor people. Look at all of them, whoa. That’s a lot of people. What are they going to do? What are they going to do when in eight, 12, maybe 16 years, I said, “Let’s hang it up. Let’s hang it up.” 16 more years. But what he’s doing is what you do when you lose. So, let’s see what he does. I don’t think he’s going to get that. I’ve got news for Joe. If you ever became president, you have to deal with some of the toughest people in the world, and Chris Wallace is very, very easy by comparison. I will tell you. I know him. I know him well. Liberal media is upset that I took the fight to Biden and exposed his very dangerous agenda. There’s a beauty. Here we go. Here we go. There’s another beauty out there. Go home to mom. Go home. Go home to mom. These are the same media outlets cheering violent demonstrations in the streets, CNN, the New York Times. They think rioting is just, “Okay, just do whatever you want.” You can do whatever you want. You don’t have to wear a mask. You just riot, 25,000 people standing on each other’s face. Do whatever you want. Can you go to church? No. Can you go to restaurants? No. Can you do anything? No, but you can riot. That’s okay. Arson’s okay, but challenging Sleepy Joe is totally off limits. So, disappointed in Fox. I’m not just running against Joe Biden. I’m running against the corrupt far-left media, socialists, and communists, and the Democrat Party, and the special interests who’ve made a living bleeding our country dry. That’s what’s happened for too long. We’ve turned it around, but don’t forget when they turned it around, I had to fight other things like a fake impeachment. I had to fight a lot of things that are not like it wasn’t in the agenda. Never forget that we fought it very well, and frankly, we had great support from the Republican Party except for one person, but that’s all right. We had great support. Never forget they are coming after me because I am fighting for you, and that’s true. This is a choice election. Our opponents put America last. I put America first, and that’s what I’ve been doing for three and a half years. Our opponents want to erase borders. I will defend our borders. You see what’s going on in the southern border. By the way, that wall, 350 miles already, got to be finished very soon. They don’t talk about the wall anymore, fellas. What’s going on? They don’t talk about it. They used to talk about it every day, “He’s not going to get his financing.” But when you’re a real estate developer, you always get financing. This was easy. “He’s not going to get his financing.” Then, we got our finance, they don’t talk about it anymore. We’re up to 300, almost 360 miles. We’re doing about 10 miles a week. Yeah, Mexico is paying for it. You do know that, right? They keep saying, “There’s going to be a border charge at the border for the trucks and cars.” It won’t even have to be a lot. There’s so many cars and trucks going through, but Mexico is paying for it and they’ve been great. They have 27,000 soldiers right now on our border, and we appreciate it. We appreciate the President of Mexico. Our opponents will send your jobs to China. I will keep your jobs in America. Our opponents want to erase our nation’s core value, and I want to defend, preserve our nation’s historic values. Our opponents stand with rioters. I stand with the heroes of law enforcement. Did you see last night? I said, “Say the words, don’t even say good or bad. Sleepy Joe, say law enforcement.” He goes, “No, I’d rather not.” “Say law enforcement, Sleepy Joe.” “Law enforcement with safety.” “No, no, no. Just law enforcement.” They tell me that all time, too, please just say law enforcement with safety. No, it’s just law enforcement. It’s very simple. It’s a very simple term. Not with safety, unsafety. It’s law enforcement. He wouldn’t say it. Then, I said, “Name one group in the entire nation,” I’ve got Minnesota now, I’ve got everybody, “name one group in the entire nation from law enforcement that’s supporting you.” Well, well, well, thank Chris Wallace, “Okay. let’s go to the next question. He’s in trouble. He’s in trouble. Let me protect him for Fox.” Joe Biden says, antifa is just an idea. Well, ideas don’t assault cops and they don’t burn down buildings. Antifa is a domestic terrorist organization. I proudly received the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Association of Police Organizations, the National Troopers Coalition, the International Union of Police Associations, and law enforcement organizations and departments in Florida, Ohio, North Carolina, Colorado, Arizona, Nevada, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Minnesota. Good. I was getting worried. Texas, New York’s finest. They’d never done it before. They came in New York’s finest, you see great people, they could solve that problem in two minutes. All they want is their authority back. It’s been taken away from them, horribly. New York’s finest never endorsed a candidate for president before, and they’re great people. They can do it. New Jersey, Illinois, and many, many more. I won’t bore you, but I could go on and on that. I just said, “Joe, give me one, please.” He was joking. I’ll tell you, he got saved. Joe Biden is saying he owns the socialism and extremism in his party, that he owns it. You know it’s not his party. It’s not Joe’s party. You got crazy Bernie, you have AOC plus three, you got all these crazy people, these maniacs, you have the green new deal. How about the green new deal? He disavowed it. Then, he said, “No, I agree with it.” I said, “Joe, it’s a hundred trillion dollars. That’s more money than this country can make in the next hundred years if everything’s perfect.” It’s so crazy. He wants to rebuild every building. Take it down and rebuild every building. Let’s see, does that include the Empire State? Well, let’s take it down and rebuild it. These people are crazy. No, more cows, no more airplanes, no more nothing. Biden even vowed to eliminate our tax cuts. That means he’ll take away your child tax credits, because I gave you child tax credits, a thousand dollars a child. He wants to take away what I gave you and revoke our historic tax relief, right to the middle-class it went. Joe Biden also refused to answer questions about packing the Supreme Court. Don’t you love the Supreme Court? How good is Amy? How good is Amy? How good is Amy? Her professor at Notre Dame, one of the most highly respected … Fill that seat, fill that seat. You better believe it. How good is she? So, her professor, one of her professors, one of the most highly respected legal scholars in the country said, “I’ve been teaching for a long time,” said, “she is the finest.” She was first in her class, graduated first in her class. He said she is the finest student he’s ever had. Of all the students, thousands of students, she’s the single best student that he’s ever had. You know what I’m saying? She would have run for president instead of Joe. He was like last in his class. Can you imagine? This is a big difference. I don’t know. How do you like Amy for the Supreme Court? Yes? If he gets elected, the hard left will appoint radical justices who will terminate the second amendment. No more guns. No more guns. As you all saw, Biden also refused to explain why his son Hunter was paid $3.5 billion protected by Chris, by the wife of the former mayor of Moscow. And they talk about me with Russia. I have nothing to do with Russia. And took out $1.5 billion from China. He manages, makes millions of dollars a year. Right? Then he got the 183. Right? $183,000 a month. Would anybody like that job? You don’t have a job. You’re not employed. You get thrown out of the military for unfortunate reasons. Your father becomes vice-president and you get hired for $183,000 a month with I think a $3 million upfront payment. I think they could have had him for less. Would anybody take that job? And he knows nothing about energy. What do you know about energy? Well, that’s not my thing. Oh, that’s okay. I mean, could you imagine if I did it? How about when sleep Joe said, “You’re not getting the $1 billion unless you get rid of the prosecutor. When you get rid of the prosecutor we’ll send you the money.” They got rid of the prosecutor. He said, “Now the money comes.” I mean, can you imagine if I said that? Unbelievable. And the press doesn’t want to talk about it. And Chris Wallace is like, “We don’t want to discuss that.” Oh really, Chris? It’s so sad. I’ll tell you. It’s so hypocritical. So sad. This is a matter of national security and economic security. The Bidens got rich while American workers got robbed. How can you deal with China if you take out three and a half billion dollars and make all sorts of money? How can you do it? A critical issue in this election, you saw what I did with China, billions and billions a year, they pay us. I gave a lot of it to the farmers, $28 billion. A critical issue because they were targeted by China. A critical issue in this election is the future of the Minnesota Iron Range. You know what. That’s why I’m here. This was just supposed to be a little get together. And then they said, “Sir, we got thousands of people want to show up. I don’t know.” I don’t know how many are involved. This is the best to be an Iron Range get together. But it turns out big. Biden has 20, 30 people. He’s got those circles. Today he had a little bit more like 30 or 40, but they were too close together. I sent him a note to Joe. They were too close. 34 people right next to each other. And yet he complained about our rally, right? Our rallies. Now it’s an honor that so many people showed up because this was going to be a little quickie just to say congratulations because Obama closed the Iron Range and I opened it and a man came up to me, a tough man, a worker, a construction worker, real worker. And he looked at me, this is two years ago, he said, “Sir, you’ve given us back our life.” And he was crying. And I said, “When was the last time you cried?” He said, “I can’t remember.” I said, “You never cried when you were a little baby. You never cried.” This is not a crier. This guy was tough as hell. He said, “Sir, he took our life away.” And let me tell you about Joe. Joe will re-institute that ban in two minutes if we lose. So you better vote for me in Minnesota. Really, I mean honestly. He said, “You gave our lives back. A lot of lives. Thousands of jobs.” And they closed it up. As Vice President Joe Biden wiped out. He wiped out so much, and that includes what he wiped out in the great state of Minnesota. And we’re not going to let it happen anymore. We’re not going to let it happen anymore. Thousands and thousands of workers, we’re not going to let it happen anymore. They were all laid off and now they’re all back. By the way they say, what the hell do I know about iron ore? A lot of steel than a lot of iron over the years. But they say it’s the greatest iron ore anywhere in the world and you should have. After I put tariffs on foreign steel, the Iron Range came roaring back. But the biggest thing I did was knock out his executive order. I’ve knocked out so much in the things that he did. He can’t like me too much. I would say he doesn’t like me too much. Hey, did you see what happened with the FBI today? They caught them cold. Comey either has the worst memory in history. I don’t remember that. Did you spy on President Trump’s campaign? “Gee, I don’t remember that.” “Did you go for a coup? Did you go for a coup?” ” I don’t remember. I don’t know.” I’ll tell you. We caught him cold. It’s about time that something happens. Okay. It’s about time that something happens. It’s enough. We got plenty of information in these crooks, bunch of crooks. A thing like that’s never happened in the history of our country, and it’s about time that something happens. We rescinded the federal withdrawal in Superior National Forest. You’ll know all about that, you people especially, to restore mineral exploration for the iron ore miners in Minnesota. What we’ve done for Minnesota. I lose Minnesota, I’m never coming back. I don’t care. I’m never coming back. We’ve protected Iron Range workers from frivolous lawsuits. That was a big deal. Right? The frivolous lawsuits. We started construction on the Soo Lock to get iron ore to market very quickly. So not only did we open it, we get it to market. We fixed the locks because you couldn’t even get it out. Those things were so old and broken. Now they’re going to be very shortly in perfect shape. I opened up permitting for copper nickel, mining, anybody involved there? It sounded a little far out, but you got a lot of people doing that. I strongly support the replacement of the decaying Line 3 pipeline. We’re going to replace it. It’s all done. It’s all done. All of this is why nine Democrat mayors of cities in the Iron Range have endorsed me over sleepy Joe Biden. Are they here tonight? I don’t know if they’re here tonight. These people are fantastic. Look at these great congressmen. Where are they? Oh, stand up. Wow. We had a ceremony a month ago where I introduced every one of them. I’m not introducing you again. It’s freezing out here. But I want to thank you. You’re great people. Great mayors. I appreciate the support very much. These are Democrats that want to vote for Trump. That endorsed me fully. We’ve done a good job over there. Everything in good shape? Right? Thank you very much. It’s a great honor. If Joe gets in, the radical left will shut down the Iron Range forever. It’s going to be gone. They’re not going to be able to open it again. Not easy to open a thing like that. Not easy. A lot more difficult than people would think. Earlier today, I took another historic step for your state when I signed an executive order, provided billions of dollars to jumpstart production of critical and other minerals, which will create countless jobs that are so important for our country. Minerals. I will always protect the state of Minnesota. I will do that. It’s been very good to me. We almost won it. We almost won it. One more speech. I had a choice. Do I do Michigan, which we won? I should’ve done them both. One more speech. We lost by very little. Think of that though. Hasn’t been won by a Republican. I don’t get that because the Democrats have done such a lousy pathetic job. Hasn’t been one since 1972. Reagan lost. It was the only state he lost. Remember? So we’re going to change that. We’ve got to change it. Who’s going to do what we’ve done for you? Right? Another massive issue for Minnesota is the election of Joe Biden’s plan to inundate your state with a historic flood of refugees. Biden and crazy Bernie Sanders have agreed on a manifesto. Did you see last night? I didn’t agree. I [inaudible 00:21:47] show and they said, “Oh, actually he did.” Oh, great. They fact checked. They found out he made a mistake. Slight mistake. It’s the worst thing you’ve ever seen. But they pledged a 700% increase in refugees. 700%. Congratulations, Minnesota. Congratulations. And what about Omar where she gets caught harvesting? What the hell is going on? I hope your US attorney is involved. What is going on with Omar? I’ve been reading these reports for two years about how corrupted, crooked she is. Let’s get with it. Let’s get with it. I mean, frankly harvesting is terrible, but it’s the least of the things that she has done. How the hell… Then she tells us how to run our country. Can you believe it? How the hell did Minnesota elect her? What the hell is wrong with you people? Right? What the hell happened? These guys in the… Stand up. Are you a big fan of Omar? I don’t think so. Stand up. Look at this guy. It looks like nobody’s going to fight him. I don’t think you’re a big fan of Omar. Right? No, she’s been crooked for a long time. This is the least of it. It’s time. And you know what? AOC also. It’s time. It’s time. You take a look at the corruption, the disgusting corruption. 700% increase refugees coming from the most dangerous places in the world including Yemen, Syria, and your favorite country, Somalia, right? You love Somalia. This guy loves Somalia. Biden will turn Minnesota into a refugee camp. And he said that. Overwhelming public resources, overcrowding schools, and inundating your hospitals. You know that. It’s already there. It’s a disgrace what they’ve done to your state. It’s a disgrace. Biden has even pledged to terminate our travel ban on jihadist regions, opening the flood gates to radical Islamic terrorism. Remember I used to talk about it all the time? I got a ban. Remember they said he’d never be able to get a ban? And then I lost at the lower court. I lost at the court of appeals. And they said, “He lost, he lost.” [inaudible 00:24:03] then I won at the Supreme Court. They didn’t even report it. Yeah. They still say, “He lost on the travel ban. He lost, he lost.” But they’re talking about the first two courts. They forget to say that the Supreme court. This is the most It’s hard to believe actually, but look at all those cameras. That’s a lot. They love it. Every time I’m getting ready, they’ve gotten very good at this, every time I’m getting ready to hit them, the lights just go off. You know those red lights? They go [inaudible 00:24:31]. My administration is keeping terrorists, extremists, and criminals out of our country. And we’re keeping them the hell out of Minnesota. We’ve ended the refugee influx into your state. You were one of the most hard hit states for whatever reason. We’ve ended it. You know that, right? You know that. Does anybody know this? Does anybody know this? I don’t think they tell you about it. But they talk about the suburbs, women in the suburbs. I ended a regulation that nobody would have done. This brings public housing, low-income housing into the suburbs. By the way, just so we can get this right, 30% of the people in the suburbs are low income people. 30% of the people in the suburbs are minorities. So we’re ruining this American dream for everybody, but he’s got a plan. It’s the worst thing you’ve ever seen having to do with zoning. They zone you out. They build low-income housing next to your house. It’s crazy. Then I hear I’m not doing well in the suburbs. I’m not doing well in the suburbs. Are you people crazy? Are you crazy? I just explained this. No, I just explained it. Thank you. No, it’s crazy. And they came to me, great people. Ben Carson, a lot of great people and they came to me and they said, “Sir, why don’t we just amend it?” I said, “No, really, I want it out. I want it over. I want it ended.” Well, it’d be a lot easier to amend it. I said, “No, I want it over. It’s not right. It’s killing your suburbs. And it is. It’s killing your suburbs.” And then they say women in the suburbs don’t like President Trump. I don’t think so. That happened last time. Remember last time? They said, “He will not do well with women. He will not do well with women. He will not do well with women.” These were the idiots on election night four years ago, “He will not do… This will be a very short night for Donald Trump,” at the time. “This will be a very short,” and at the end they said, “He did really well with women.” It was sort of weird. Anyway, we did well with everybody, actually, and we’re going to do even better now. We have more… Look at this crowd, this was supposed to be a few people. This was supposed to be just a little celebration. I said, “Oh, good. A little celebration.” I figured a couple of hundred people like Sleepy Joe gets it his best day. I said, “How many people?” “About 10,000, Sir.” I said, “Oh, that’s nice.” In just three and a half years, we’ve secured America’s border, rebuilt awesome power of the US military, obliterated the ISIS Caliphate, fixed our disastrous trade deals, and they were a disaster, and brought jobs back home to America. And back home to Minnesota, we brought a lot of jobs back. Last year before the plague came in from China, you had the best year you’ve ever had. The year before that, you had the best year you’ve ever had until the following year, and we’re doing it again, we’re building it up rapidly. China came up, they gave us the plague, it’s no good, we’re never going to forget that. I did a trade deal, the ink wasn’t even dry, and they let that happen. We’re never going to forget it. We built the greatest economy in the history of the world, and now we are quickly doing it again. We’ve added a historic 10.6 million jobs in the last four months. That’s a record the likes of which has never even been close to being challenged. To fight the China virus, we launched the largest national mobilization since world war II, we pioneered lifesaving therapies reducing the fatality rate 85% since April. Think of that, meaning you go to the hospital and you got a lot better chance. I’ll tell you what. I spoke to a gentleman today from Pfizer. I speak to all of these guys, these are great people, and they’re coming up with things that are phenomenal, Regeneron, we are coming up with things that are phenomenal, including therapeutics for therapies. It’s incredible what’s happening. You’ll be seeing it very… And By the way with Biden, it would have been years before you came up with any of this stuff. Years, it would have been years. He complains, “You did not fast enough.” And yet he’s all over the place calling me xenophobic because I closed the border. Okay, how do you figure that one? This guy, just a politician. He’s just another politician. 47 years he hasn’t done a damn thing, but now he’s going to. “I haven’t done anything in 47 years, but now I’m going to.” Europe is almost a 50% greater excess mortality rate than the United States, you don’t hear that. Through Operation Warp Speed, we will develop and distribute a vaccine in record time, it’s going to be very, very soon. And before the end of the year, maybe sooner than that. On November 3rd, Minnesota will decide whether we end this pandemic, defeat the virus, and return to record prosperity. Either way, we’re returning, either way. We’re going to have the vaccine. We’re Well, whether we allow Joe Biden to kill the recovery… He wants to shut down. This guy says, “Let’s shut it down.” A lot of deaths caused by shutdown; depression, death, drugs, alcoholism, horrendous family fights, horrendous family fights, and he wants to destroy those suburbs by abolishing single family zoning. All of these things are just a horrible thing, what he wants to do. And I think he’s going to do it because he’s not smart enough to understand that the other side has big problems. You know, we did something great. We had the greatest economy in history and we had to close it down because we would have lost millions of lives, and now we’re opening it up and we’re doing it at a level like nobody’s ever seen before, and it’s a great thing, and we’re going to be back in business very soon, except for some Democrats. And they’ll all open up. They’re going to all open up right after November 3rd. They’ll announce, “We’d like to tell you that we’re all opening up November 4th.” Did you see the one group that said, “We’re opening up right after the election, I think we’ll open up.” That’s great. These are terrible people because they’re more interested in politics than they are in the lives of people. They want to confiscate your guns and indoctrinate your children to this poisonous anti-American rhetoric and lies. To combat the toxic left… And you see this, that toxic left-wing propaganda in our schools, we are launching a new pro-American lesson plan for students called the 1776 Commission. We will teach our children the truth about America that we are the most exceptional nation on the face of the earth. That’s what I want them to hear. We are joined tonight by some real warriors, friends of mine. They fight with… they just win, they know how to win. I’m telling you, you have some great ones and they really are, they’re great people. The impeachment hoax, they fought it so great. These are real warriors. I call them warriors. Representatives Tom Emmer, Jim Hagedorn and Pete Stauber, great hockey player. And I’ll tell you, we have some incredible congressional candidates that we’re going to work because we got to get Nancy Pelosi the hell out of there, and we’re very [inaudible 00:32:10]. We have some candidates; Tyler Kistner, where’s Tyler? Thank you, Tyler. Great job. I hear great things, Tyler. A man with the greatest name in politics, Lacy Johnson, great guy, great guy. And somebody who’s going to help us a lot along with Tyler, Lacy, Michelle Fischbach. Thank you Michelle. Thank you. We’re going to be working with you, and they all have my total endorsement, you know that. Okay? The next US Senator from Minnesota is a man who was born for this position unlike your current Senator, who nobody knows who the hell she is. I said, who is she? Is she in the Senate? Jason Lewis. Thank you, Jason. Great job you’re doing. We got to get Jason in, got to get them all in. RNC co-chairman, Tommy Hicks. Thank you, Tommy. And Mike Lindell, he makes more pillows this guy. He makes more pillows, thank you Mike. He goes to a lot of my rallies, he likes these rallies, and we like him. Here as well tonight is 96-year-old world war II veteran, Dr. John [Ringsred 00:07:35]. Look at you. You look great, John. Wow. You look good. Handsome. Thank you, John. Thank you very much. It’s an honor, john. After years of rebuilding other nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation. In 2017, I signed a very historic executive order making it difficult and really just looking at what government policy has to do in order to buy American and hire American. You ever see Biden? He’s got a sign, buy American. I said he got it from me. I’ve been doing this for a long time. Copies my campaign, copies our plans. He copies a lot, like you haven’t heard that before. He invested $2.5 trillion in the military, we put 2.5 trillion in. We have the best weapons, all made in the USA. We have the greatest weaponry we’ve ever had. No country has ever come close to the kind of firepower we have. Hope to God we never have to use it. We have firepower and weapons and the Republicans said it because Democrats… We have to have that, otherwise we’re going to be at the mercy of other countries. We have the greatest firepower, the greatest weapons in the history of the world. Hope to God that we never have to use them. And we launched a new branch of the US armed forces, first since the air force in 75 years, it’s called the space force. That’s a big deal. We killed the founder and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi gone. We took out the world’s number one terrorist, and the murderer of so many American troops and plenty of other troops, Qasem Soleimani is no longer with us. I withdrew from the last administration’s total disaster, the Iran Nuclear Deal. Obama gave them 150 billion. That was bad, but he gave him 1.8 billion in cash. How the hell do you do that? What does 1.8 billion in cash look like? They must have looked at that, they said, “Man, plane loads of cash.” I kept my promise recognized the true capital of Israel, and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, and instead of endless wars, we are forging peace in the Middle East. And I was nominated for three Nobel Prizes and I didn’t get one story. I have to tell you, because they refuse to write it. When Obama got his Nobel Prize, it was the biggest story I’ve ever seen. And he didn’t even know why he got it. He got it like immediately upon taking office. [inaudible 00:36:46] but I told my first lady, I told our first lady, “Darling, you’re going to be so proud of me tonight. We’re going to watch television and you’re not going to believe how big this [inaudible 00:10:54]” “What happened? What happened?” “Darling, I was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for Israel, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates. And then I was nominated again for Serbia, Kosovo, all different. Then I was nominated a third time.” But I said, “First time, second time, I was a little bit.” Yeah, I know. I love you too. But I said to our First Lady, “Watch this tonight, Darling, it’s going to be.” And I turn to Lester Holt, number two show. I turn to Lester Holt, and they covered one story was about rain, another was about the environment, another was about something else, another, it was a bad hit on me, another one, something else. So now we’re through with about half of it. Now they went to the longest commercial I’ve ever seen. Not supposed to, when you report the fake news, you’re not supposed to get free air time from the US government. Does anybody know what that means? And then they went onto the second half again and again and again, she looked at me, “Darling, I don’t think they’re going to cover this.” I said, “It’s impossible. It’s a nomination for the Nobel Peace award. It’s impossible.” Guess what? It ended, we got nothing. Then three days later we got nothing. And on the third time, the third time I said, “Let’s not even watch. We’re not getting anything. These people are sick.” But I did more in 47 months than sleepy Joe Biden did in 47 years. And now he’s pushing the most far-left platform in history, the Biden plan would destroy social security and destroy protections for people with preexisting conditions, give free federal healthcare to all illegal aliens, bankrupting Medicare. But you know, it’s going to happen. They’re going to pour into our country. When they hear that, they’re going to come in. They’re very smart, very sophisticated, you’d be surprised. Ban school choice and ban all charter schools. No more charter schools, no more school choice. Well, we’re making a lot of progress. In the second term, I will provide school choice to every parent in America. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans. And in conclusion, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we will end our reliance on China once and for all. Did you see what he said last night about manufacturing? Well, Obama said we’re not going to ever have manufacturing and you’d need a magic wand. Last night he said we’re doing manufacturing. No, no. They gave up on manufacturing. I have almost 700,000 manufacturing jobs. I said, “How can you lose manufacturing?” He’s bad news. They lie. We will make our medical supplies right here in the United States. We will hire more police, increase penalties on assaults. And we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms. Second amendment. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens, and we will keep out, we will keep people out of our country. Thank you. But we will keep out of these ridiculous, endless Wars in countries that you’ve never heard of and you never will hear of. It’s ridiculous. And we’re bringing them all home. You see that. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. That’s what we have. Ridiculous. We’re all over the world. We’re in places nobody ever heard of before. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency. I’ve already signed it. Can you believe it? It kicks in on January 1st. Can you imagine if this clown gets in? And they’ll say, “He got price transparency. What’s that?” That’ll have such an impact. It kicks in. I said to my people, “You think you could have kicked it in a little bit earlier?” And further reduced health insurance premiums and the cost of prescription drugs, which we’re going to be bringing down massively because of Favorite Nations. We will strongly protect Medicare and social security, and we will always protect those incredible people, as I said, with pre-existing conditions. America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. And it will be soon. You have to see. NASA has become again the greatest space center in the world. You had to see what it looked like when I took over. It was terrible. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, In God We Trust. For years, you had a President who apologized for America. Now you have a President who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of Minnesota. Thank you. But if we don’t win, I’m never calling you great again. So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, and get you co-workers and get out and vote. We got to win. We got to win. Early voting has already begun. Don’t wait. Please go out and vote. Did you see in New York today? A hundred thousand fraudulent ballots. They send out a hundred thousand ballots. Wrong names, wrong addresses, wrong envelopes. Other than that, that did quite well. Think of it, a hundred thousand. So you know what this solution? That’s okay. We’ll send out another a hundred thousand. I said, “Really? What’s going to happen to the first hundred thousand. Who’s going to vote them?” This is crazy what’s going on. This is crazy. From St. Paul to St. Cloud, from Minneapolis to Minnetonka, and from Rochester to right here in Duluth. I like Duluth. This great state was pioneered by men and women who brave the wilderness and the winters to build a better life for themselves and for their families. They were truly brave, brilliant, incredible people. They were tough and they were strong. They didn’t have a lot of money. They didn’t have a lot of luxury, but they had grit, they had faith and they had each other. They were miners and lumberjacks, fishermen and farmers, shipbuilders and shopkeepers, but they all had one thing in common. They loved their families, they loved their country and they loved their God. Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We’re going to keep on fighting. And we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. It’s true. We’re to keep on winning. You know, Minnesota, maybe I’ll just do a [inaudible 00:45:12] because we need Jason. Jason. Where’s Jason? Jason’s going to come. Jason Lewis. He’s going to be your Senator. You’re going to win so much. You know that one, right? You’ve heard it. Should I do it or not? I’ve got this beautiful crescendo of a speech and now I have to ruin it with this story with Jason, but let’s do it anyway. But we’re going to win so much because Minnesota before I came around was not doing too well. Okay? Was not doing too well. Then you had your best years ever. But we’re going to win so much and you’re going to go and see your great Senator, Jason Lewis. He’s going to say. And you’re going to see Emmer, and you’re going to see all of that. And you’re going to say, Mr. Senator, please go see the President. We’re winning too much. We can’t stand it, sir. Minnesota, we’re not used to winning this much. It’s too much, sir. Please, go see. Well, I don’t want to do that. Please Senator. Go see the President. We’re winning too much. We cannot stand it. For years we’ve done poorly before he came along. Now we’re doing so well. And we’re growing now stronger than ever before. We don’t want to win so much, Mr. Senator. So your Senator is going to come in. “Hi Jason, how are you doing?” “Sir, Minnesota is winning too much. We have to stop it.” I said, “What are you talking about?” “Sir, we have to stop it. It’s just too much running. We have to stop it.” I say, “Jason, let me tell you. I know the people of Minnesota and they love winning. They’re going to keep winning. We’re going to win. We’re going to win so much. We’re going to keep on winning. And you’re going to have the greatest year that you’ve ever had next year and the year after. And that’s where it’s heading. So I just want to thank you, and Jason, I’m sorry. I will not follow your wish.” Thank you very much. But we are. We’re one movement. We’re one family. We’re one beautiful people in one glorious nation under God and together with the incredible people of Minnesota, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, Minnesota. Go out and vote.

"75","10-01-20","If you look at what he did, he was probably, or possibly losing that coherence that everybody talks about, because he’s a mess. Let’s face it. He’s a mess. Now I could have waited, but he was saying so many lies that I figured it was just better to bring it up as he’s saying them, because it was just lie after lie, after lie. And so I’d do it as he said it, I would criticize him. And I think it was effective. If you look at the polls, I mean, almost all the polls, the poll people, the polls say that I won. The Hispanics, they had me close to 70% at 28 because they’re strong people, smart people. I mean, I would have preferred letting him catch himself because he can’t issue a full statement practically, but at the same time, on the assumption that he does, he’s going on and on with lie after lie, so I had to correct those lies as they came up. Too many to go back and get. We didn’t have enough paper. Too many to go and get. And I don’t know. I think it was very effective. Frankly, I’d like to leave the same format. I like the format. Well, this is the rules that were agreed to, but I think it would be very bad. Do you remember with Hillary Clinton, they had modulated my mic, and they actually apologized for it, but they modulated my mic. So when I looked at her, they had my mic turned off or way down, and I said, “What’s going on over here?” They actually issued an apology. So we’re dealing with very tricky people here, but I think you remember that very well. They modulated my mic and they say I won all of the debates. So I was in 16, 17 debates. They say I won all of the debates. I like this format, but at the same time, he’s got got to be truthful. And by the way, a number of people brought up today, Sean, that he was the one that interrupted me. He started off with three major interruptions long before I started doing it to him. Well, I went after him on that and I said, “Are you going to stack the Court?” I also said, “Are you going to say the words law and order?” He wouldn’t say them. He then said, “Law and order with safety and justice,” or something. But I said to him that, but we need law and order in our country. And the Democrats cities are falling to pieces with these people running them. But stacking the courts. They can have many justices. They want to put many because we’ve been beating them, and we have the nine justices and we have a great new one going on. But now what they want to do is they want to put many additional justices on the Supreme Court. It’s sort of like you’re losing the game and you start cheating. They are. I mean, they’re doing it with the ballots, they’re doing it with the Supreme Court, and it’s a very sad thing. But they are, they are looking to stack the court. And they are also going to add two or three new states. I heard Guam and two others that you mentioned, as you know. That would give them six automatic Senate seats, automatic, no chance. It would be very unfair. And 20 something congressional seats. So that’s what they want to do. So if you give them what they want, we really have a one-party system. We can never catch up. So they’ll be talking about anywhere from four to six senators. Republicans can’t win those states, although I’ve been better to Puerto Rico than any other president. I’ve given them a lot of help. But if you take a look at what’s happening, they’re not good to Puerto Rico, but I’ve been good to Puerto Rico. I have a great relationship to Puerto Rico. But they’re looking for statehood. A lot of Puerto Ricans don’t want statehood. They’re doing better the way it has now, frankly. And you’ve been seeing this. This has been taking place. They want to put two or three states. So they want to have 53, right? 53. What’s the flag going to look like? Right, Sean? What’s the flag going to look like? They want to have 53 or 52? Depending on what they do, I guess they could probably do even more than that. We have islands all over the place. What don’t they go for the whole ball game? So it’s a very, very sad thing for our country. Very, very sad thing. And in all fairness to Mitch, he did not want to do the nuclear option. And I disagreed because I said, “They’re going to do it.” It turned out that they are, but he’s a legitimate guy. He wasn’t going to do the nuclear option because he thought it was bad for our country. So I understood that. I didn’t go wild. But I did say, “It would be good to do it because they’re going to do it.” So it’s a very sad thing. So you’re going to have two or three more states added. You’re going to have four or six senators added, 100% Democrat, 100%. You’re going to have maybe 20 congressional candidates or districts added. And it’s really a horrible thing. It’s going to be very unfair. You’re going to end up having a one-party system in the United States. So if people want to stop that you got to vote against the Democrats. So she did test positive. I just heard about this. She tested positive. She’s a hard worker, a lot of masks. So she wears masks a lot, but she tested positive, and I just went out with a test, because we spend a lot of time and the first lady just went out with a test also. So whether we quarantine or whether we have it, I don’t know. It’s very hard when you’re with soldiers, when you’re with airman, you’re with the Marines and the police officers, I’m with them so much. And when they come over to you it’s very hard to say, “Stay back, stay back.” It’s a tough kind of a situation. It’s a terrible thing. So I just went for a test and we’ll see what happens. I mean, who knows? But you know Hope very well. She’s fantastic and she’s done a great job. But it’s very, very hard when you are with people from the military or from law enforcement and they come over to you and they want to hug you and they want to kiss you because we really have done a good job for them. And you get close and things happen. I was surprised to hear with Hope, but she’s a very warm person with them, and she knows there’s a risk, but she’s young. And I just went out for a test. They just do it. It’ll come back later, I guess. And the first lady also, because we spend a lot of time with Hope and others. So we’ll see what happens, but you have to treat our people great. You can’t just say, “Stay away, stay away.” They come up to you. They have such love with what we’ve done for them. And there’s such love and you have to treat our people great. I think the vaccines are coming quickly. I do think it’s somewhat political. They’d like to do it, even the drug companies, they’ve dealt with these people a long time. I think they’d like to do it after the election, even if it’s a couple of days, but the fact is, the vaccines are coming out. The therapeutics are coming out, and they’re coming out really good. Regeneron and others, other companies, are great, Eli Lilly. And so, we’ll have to see. The survival rate is so much better now than it was. You’ve seen those numbers. I guess 95% or something like that, better. So we’ll have to see. I mean, I’ll get my test back either tonight or tomorrow morning, but I spend a lot of time with Hope and so does the first lady, and she’s tremendous. I was a little surprised, but she’s a very warm person. She has a hard time when soldiers and law enforcement comes up to her. She wants to treat them great, not say, “Stay away. I can’t get near you.” It’s a very, very tough disease. A scam and everyone knows it, Sean. It’s a scam and everyone knows it. Well, in New York they last 100,000 ballots were sent out wrong. The envelopes were wrong, the names were wrong, everything was wrong. So they said, “Oh, that’s okay. We’ll send out a new 100,000.” Okay, let’s assume they get it right. What happens to 100,000 that they sent out? They’re going to be sent back by somebody and it’s going to be a fraud. This is a terrible thing that’s happening to our country. And the only one that knows it better than you and I and other people is the Democrats. They know it, they know it. They’re smart. But I’ll tell you the big hope is that we have great federal judges. And we have a lot of cases in front of these federal judges. And I think they’re really talented, very smart. And I think that we’re going to do very well. How about this? The election ends on November 3rd, but they’re giving certain states the right to go another week. So that means we’re not going to know, because they’re big states, that means we’re not going to know the election for another week. Just take a look at New York. Take a look at the one city, the ballots that were thrown into a garbage can and they all had the Trump name on it. They were military ballots. They were thrown into a garbage can. The ones that were on a tray and they were thrown into a creek or river, it’s a terrible thing. And if you look at Carolyn Maloney, what they did to that guy that ran against her is a disgrace. That’s in New York, and that’s only for a congressional race. They have no idea where the votes are, where the ballots are. This is going to be all over. This is in Virginia. This is in New Jersey. It’s a very, very sad thing. And hopefully we can win by a lot because I have no doubt that they’re going to be doing a number. I have no doubt about it. And the press knows that too. They act so sacrosanct. They act so, “Oh, it’s so terrible. He’s talking about our democracy.” They know what’s going on. It’s really a shame. If the other side did this, you would see everybody would be arrested, put in jail. You have to see what’s going on. But the good news is we just got a very good decision in Rhode Island, great decision. We have some great decisions coming down. You have to have the votes in by November 3rd. You have to have it signed. You have to have it certified. They have to guarantee the certification. I mean, in Nevada, Sean, they don’t want to have any certification of a signature, just do a signature and they don’t want to have certification. I think you don’t even have to sign it. And the governor is a very political person. It’s a ridiculous thing. And we’re going to win Nevada on a fair basis, but it’s very hard when they send millions of ballots out and then they cheat. Well, it’s a scam. They spied on our campaign. They got caught. The only sad thing is nothing’s happening with them and their a bunch of crooks. They spied on our campaign. They got caught. They tried to do a coup and they got caught. Now we get to see what’s going to happen. It’s time to move. This is ridiculous, okay? This is ridiculous. It’s so sad. We caught them spying on our campaign. Never happened before. Spied before and after, and it never happened before. And I watched Comey. He couldn’t remember anything, but he’s writing all these books. They’re guilty as hell. They should all be in jail, okay? You know it and I know it. They should all be in jail and it’s disgraceful. It’s a disgrace to our country if they don’t go to jail. Hillary Clinton got caught, Comey got caught, they all got caught. And Biden, by the way, mentioned the Logan Act. That was a big part of it, and Obama too. It’s a disgrace what’s happened, a disgrace. And they should do something about it. They can’t let this just go on ad infinitum. They should do something about it. Well, it is. I mean, it is, but we’ve already rebuilt the military, two and a half trillion dollars. It’s the strongest military in the world by far. We have weapons the likes of which nobody even comes close to. And so we’ve done that. We’ve cut taxes at a record level. If you look at regulations, we’ve cut more regulations than any president in history by far. Well, I think better than that. I think you’re going to see some great numbers just two days before, because you’re going to have the third quarter come out just before the election, and I think you’re going to be up anywhere from 22 to 35% in GDP. And if that’s the case, that’s bigger than any economic rebound in history. So I think that’ll be good. Let’s see what happens, but those numbers are coming out sometime prior to November 3rd, which is the election. Thank you very much, Sean. Thank you.

"76","10-03-20","I want to begin by thanking all of the incredible medical professionals, the doctors, the nurses, everybody at Walter Reed Medical Center, I think it’s the finest in the world, for the incredible job they’ve been doing. I came here, wasn’t feeling so well. I feel much better now. We’re working hard to get me all the way back. I have to be back, because we still have to make America great again. We’ve done an awfully good job of that, but we still have steps to go, and we have to finish that job, and I’ll be back. I think I’ll be back soon, and I look forward to finishing up the campaign the way it was started, and the way we’ve been doing, and the kind of numbers that we’ve been doing. We’ve been so proud of it, but this was something that happened, and it’s happened to millions of people all over the world, and I’m fighting for them. Not just in the US. I’m fighting for them all over the world. We’re going to beat this coronavirus, or whatever you want to call it, and we’re going to beat it soundly. So many things have happened. If you look at the therapeutics, which I’m taking right now, some of them, and others are coming out soon that are looking like, frankly, they’re miracles, if you want to know the truth. They’re miracles. People criticize me when I say that, but we have things happening that look like they’re miracles coming down from God, so I just want to tell you that I’m starting to feel good. You don’t know over the next period of a few days, I guess that’s the real test, so we’ll be seeing what happens over those next couple of days. I just want to be so thankful for all of the support I’ve seen, whether it’s on television, or reading about it. I most of all appreciate what’s been said by the American people, by almost a bipartisan consensus of American people. It’s a beautiful thing to see, and I very much appreciate it, and I won’t forget it. I promise you that. I also want to thank the leaders of the world for their condolences, and they know what we’re going through. They know what, as your leader, what I have to go through, but I had no choice, because I just didn’t want to stay in the White House. I was given that alternative. Stay in the White House, lock yourself in. Don’t ever leave. Don’t even go to the Oval Office. Just stay upstairs, and enjoy it. Don’t see people. Don’t talk to people, and just be done with it, and I can’t do that. I had to be out front, and this is America. This is the United States. This is the greatest country in the world. This is the most powerful country in the world. I can’t be locked up in a room upstairs, and totally safe, and just say, “Hey, whatever happens, happens.” I can’t do that. We have to confront problems. As a leader, you have to confront problems. There’s never been a great leader that would have done that, so that’s where it is. I’m doing well. I want to thank everybody. Our first lady is doing very well. Melania asked me to say something as to the respect that she has for our country, the love that she has for our country, and we’re both doing well. Melania is really handling it very nicely, as you’ve probably read. She’s slightly younger than me, just a little tiny bit, and therefore just … We know the disease. We know the situation with age versus younger people, and Melania is handling it, statistically, like it’s supposed to be handled, and that makes me very happy, and it makes the country very happy, but I’m also doing well, and I think we’re going to have a very good result. Again, over the next few days, we’re going to probably know for sure, so I just want to thank everybody out there, everybody all over the world, specifically the United States. The outpouring of love has been incredible. I will never forget. Thank you very much.

"77","10-04-20","We’re getting great reports from the doctors. This is an incredible hospital, Walter Reed. The work they do is just absolutely amazing. And I want to thank them all. The nurses, the doctors, everybody here. I’ve also gotten to meet some of the soldiers and the first responders, and what a group. I also think we’re going to pay a little surprise to some of the great patriots that we have out on the street. And they’ve been out there for a long time, and they’ve got Trump flags. And they love our country. So I’m not telling anybody, but you. But I’m about to make a little surprise visit. So perhaps I’ll get there before you get to see me. But when I look at the enthusiasm, and we have enthusiasm like probably nobody’s ever had. Our people that love the job we’re doing. We have more enthusiasm than maybe anybody. So it’s been a very interesting journey. I learned a lot about COVID. I learned it by really going to school. This is the real school. This isn’t the “let’s read the book” school. And I get it. And I understand it. And it’s a very interesting thing. And I’m going to be letting you know about it. In the meantime, we love the USA, and we love what’s happening. Thank you."
"78","10-05-20","I just left Walter Reed Medical Center, and it’s really something very special. The doctors, the nurses, the first responders, and I learned so much about coronavirus. One thing that’s for certain, don’t let it dominate you. Don’t be afraid of it. You’re going to beat it. We have the best medical equipment. We have the best medicines all developed recently, and you’re going to beat it. I went … I didn’t feel so good. And two days ago, I could have left two days ago. Two days ago, I felt great. Like, better than I have in a long time. I said just recently … better than 20 years ago. Don’t let it dominate. Don’t let it take over your lives. Don’t let that happen. We have the greatest country in the world. We’re going back. We’re going back to work. We’re going to be out front. As your leader, I had to do that. I knew there’s danger to it, but I had to do it. I stood out front. I led. Nobody that’s a leader would not do what I did. And I know there’s a risk. There’s a danger. But that’s okay, and now I’m better. Maybe I’m immune. I don’t know. But don’t let it dominate your lives. Get out there. Be careful. We have the best medicines in the world, and they’re all happened very shortly, and they’re all getting approved. And the vaccines are coming momentarily. Thank you very much. And Walter Reed, what a group of people. Thank you very much."
"79","10-07-20","Hi, perhaps you recognize me? It’s your favorite president. And I’m standing in front of the Oval Office at the White House, which is always an exciting place to be. I got back a day ago from Walter Reed Medical Center. I spent four days there, and didn’t have to, I could’ve stayed at the White House, but the doctors said, “Because you’re president, let’s do it.” I said, “Fine. You tell me what to do, and I’m going to listen.” These are great professionals. They’ve done a fantastic job. And by the way, not only at Walter Reed, all over the country, we have the greatest doctors in the world, we have the greatest nurses, the greatest first responders, law enforcement, by the way, incredible, firefighters, everybody. They’re just great. We have great people. This is a great country. But I spent four days there and I went in and I wasn’t feeling so hot, and within a very short period of time, they gave me Regeneron. It’s called Regeneron, and other things too. But I think this was the key, but they gave me Regeneron, and it was like, unbelievable. I felt good immediately. I felt as good three days ago as I do now. So I just want to say, we have Regeneron. We have a very similar drug from Eli Lilly and they’re coming out and we’re trying to get them on an emergency basis. We’ve authorized it. I’ve authorized it. If you’re in the hospital and you’re feeling really bad, I think we’re going to work it so that you get them and you’re going to get them free, and especially if you’re a senior, we’re going to get you in there quick. We have hundreds of thousands of doses that are just about ready. I have emergency use authorization, all set, and we got to get it signed now, and you’re going to get better. You’re going to get better, really fast. This is things that nobody even thought of a few months ago. The job that the scientists, the labs, everybody has done is incredible. Then in addition to that, you have various other drugs that help a lot. But I view these, I know they call them therapeutic, but to me it wasn’t therapeutic, it just made me better. I call that a cure. So I want to get these things done. So we have to get them done. We have to get them approved, and I want to get them to the hospitals where people are feeling badly. That’s much more important to me than the vaccine. But on the vaccines, we have many companies that are in final stages for the vaccines, Johnson & Johnson. Moderna, Pfizer, all great companies, but many of them, and we’re going to have a great vaccine very, very shortly. I think we should have it before the election, but frankly, the politics gets involved and that’s okay, they want to play their games. It’s going to be right after the election, but we did it. Nobody else, nobody else would have been able to do it. The FDA has acted as quickly as they’ve ever acted in history. There’s never been a time and no president has ever pushed him like I pushed them either, to be honest with you. But the FDA is approving things in a matter of weeks, that used to take a matter of years. So we have these drugs, Eli Lilly, and the others that are so good. But they are, in my opinion, remember this, they’re going to say that they’re, “Therapeutic.” And I guess they are therapeutic. Some people don’t know how to define therapeutic. I view it different, it’s a cure. For me, I walked in, I didn’t feel good. A short 24 hours later, I was feeling great, I wanted to get out of the hospital and that’s what I want for everybody. I want everybody to be given the same treatment as your president because I feel great. I feel like perfect. So I think this was a blessing from God that I caught it. This was a blessing in disguise. I caught it. I heard about this drug. I said, “Let me take it.” It was my suggestion. I said, “Let me take it,” and it was incredible the way it worked. Incredible. I think if I didn’t catch it, we’d be looking at that like a number of other drugs, but it really did a fantastic job. I want to get for you what I got and I’m going to make it free. You’re not going to pay for it. It wasn’t your fault that this happened. It was China’s fault, and China is going to pay a big price for what they’ve done to this country. China is going to pay a big price for what they’ve done to the world. This was China’s fault, and just remember that. So we’re going to get you the drug. It’s going to be free. We’re going to get it into the hospitals as soon as you can, as soon as we can. And you’ll see some amazing things happen because we have … our military is doing the distribution. It’s called logistics, and they deliver, hundreds of thousands of troops in a matter of days. This is easy stuff for them. Our generals are all ready, we’re waiting for the emergency use authorization and the drug companies have just made a lot of it. So hopefully this is going to be not just a therapeutic, it’s going to be much more than a therapeutic. You’re going to get better. You’re going to get better fast, just like I did. So again, a blessing in disguise. Good luck.

"80","10-08-20","Really good, and First Lady is doing really good. I thought Mark was fantastic, and I love your show. Yeah, I just saw the doctors today. They think I’m in great shape. I’m in great shape. I know I’m in good shape. And I’ll tell you, I took this Regeneron. It’s phenomenal. Eli Lilly has something very comparable. It’s phenomenal. It’s a whole new day. It’s all… If you go back a few months, nobody ever even thought about this stuff. We came up with it, and I’m going to have it delivered to every hospital we have sick people with the COVID, or the China Virus as we call it, and we’re going to make people better. It actually made me better. I went in, I could have left a day later. I’m telling you Sean, it was incredible. So, that’s Regeneron. But again, Eli Lilly has something similar. The kind of things we’re coming up with now are incredible. Remdesivir, but that’s a little bit different, works much differently actually. But these things are absolutely incredible. I think I’m going to try doing a rally on Saturday night if we have enough time to put it together. But we want to do a rally probably in Florida on Saturday night. I might come back and do one in Pennsylvania the following night. It’s incredible what’s going on, because I feel so good. Well, what we’re doing is probably the test will be tomorrow, the actual test, because there’s no reason to test all the time. But they found very little the infection or virus, if any. I don’t know that they found any. I didn’t go into it greatly with the doctors. We have these great doctors at Walter Reed, and you do rely on them. They’re really fantastic talents, and they came in from Johns Hopkins also and other places. Yeah. When you’re president, there are so many doctors looking over me. I think I’m the most analyzed human being in the world right now. But we have… They had people at not only Walter Reed which is incredible with the job they do, but also Johns Hopkins and other hospitals. I think they’re amazed at how quickly this went frankly. Well, I didn’t even want to use them. Last time, I had a big problem. They isolated my mikes when I had one debate… We had three debates with Hillary. Or I think the first debate, they… Excuse me. On the first debate, they asked isolated the mike and they isolated it very, very seriously, and they actually apologized to me. And I said-“What’s this all about?” They were Clinton people. And I said, “We ought to just do the debates ourselves, John. We ought to just do it ourselves.” I pick… I’m the president, so we won’t to have debates. I’d rather just do it ourselves. Pick some good anchor. So I ended up with Chris Wallace who’s essentially… Look, his father did me once or twice. Twice, I guess. Those 60 minutes, he was great, Mike. Chris is not Mike that I can tell you. He’s not even close, but Chris was terrible. He was protecting Biden the whole night. I asked Biden about, “Why did he get all of that money from the Mayor of Russia, from the wife of the Mayor of Russia?” Then Chris wouldn’t let that be answered. When I said, “What did you do with a billion dollars? You’re not getting a billion dollars to Ukraine unless you get rid of the prosecutor.” Chris wouldn’t let that. He protected him. The guy was choking like a dog. He couldn’t answer the questions and he was choking like a dog. And Chris kept staying, and so now we have another one. I didn’t know this, but the other one is from C-SPAN and he’s never-Trumper, and I think somebody said he worked for Biden at one point. These are the people we get. That’s okay, because I’ve had some bad ones over the years, and I’ve got an unblemished record I think in the debating world according to the polls. If you look at [inaudible 00:04:59] 15 debates last time, and they say I won them all against very talented people in some cases. But I will say this, that it’s a very sad thing. Now you have this Debate Commission. It’s a joke. The commission’s a joke. Take a look at the letter they wrote me four years ago when they apologized. They were oscillating my mike. They were turning it up and down when I was speaking to Hillary, crooked Hillary who turns out to be very crooked. Look at all the stuff we found out on Obama and Biden and her. So we’ll see what happens. But no, I’m not interested in doing a virtual. I’m not Joe Biden. I’m not going to do a virtual debate, sit behind a computer screen. That gives them the answers, because there’ll be handing him the answers just like he gets what he asks. He does news conferences, he does them and they give him the answer and they give him the question and they give him what kind of a news conference. He does them all the time. He was choking like a dog the other night, but Chris Wallace bailed him in. He just bailed him in or bailed him out. Well, I might. I’ll do it right through your show. Let’s go, Joe. Let’s have a fair… Let’s get a fair anchor, somebody like a great Sean Hannity. We’ll get Rush. We'll get Mark. We'll get Laura. We'll get...We got a lot of them out there. We got a lot. We’ll get Jesse or Pete. We got a lot of them. Tucker [inaudible 00:06:48] feeling good. [crosstalk 00:06:49] is a disgrace. but this is a disgrace what’s going on. So now I find out the guy that’s doing it from C-SPAN is a never-Trumper, but I don’t mind that. Look at the people I’ve had in the past, and I’ve always won the debates. I had Martha Raddatz. Her hatred was so incredible I couldn’t believe it, but I beat Hillary in that debate easily. So I don’t mind that. It’s not even that. But I’m not going to sit behind a computer and have somebody feed him answers, because he has no idea, because he won’t be president for three months before the wonderful Kamala takes over with her. She’s the most liberal person in the senate. She’s not a socialist. She’s a step beyond socialism as you know. I thought Mike was great, legitimately. I don’t mean because he’s with me and he’s my friend and he’s done a great job as vice president, I thought he was great. He’s a calm person. We’re really a good combination. A lot of people have said that for a long time. He’s a calm person. He’s a good person, and he was just… He couldn’t believe some of the things she was saying, and he really didn’t. He couldn’t believe it what she was saying. They lie. They lie so much, like fracking. Him and her for a year, whatever the Democrat debate said, we are against fracking. We will… Biden says, “We will never ever see fracking and…” etc. As soon as he gets the nomination, he has to center over a little bit. No, we want to go fracking. We’ll be fracking. Her too, even her. I mean, she’s a super… Then they get beat up by AOC plus 3, because they said, you never said that before. Now the press gives them a pass. The reason they give them a pass is because they are fake. The news is fake, the enemy of the people and the press gives them a pass. If I ever did that, I would be excoriated. Yeah, terrible thing. I think it was a terrible thing to say. I think it’s so disrespectful to the people, and he should have said something, and say, “Look, to the best of my knowledge, this is probably what I’d do.” I think what he said was so disrespectful to the process and to the people. What he said then was just disgraceful. But what that means really is that they’re going to do it, because obviously, that means 100% that’s what they’re going to do. No, they’re going to end the filibuster and they’re going to do things that you wouldn’t have thought. I’d been fighting the filibuster with Mitch for a long time, because I said, “Mitch, they’re going to do whatever. If they ever got in, Schumer would do that on day one.” I agree that what they did was right. You take a look at what Mitch and some very good Republican senators, because it’s good for the country. But I said, “Here’s the problem. If they ever got in, day one, this would be the first move they make, end the filibuster,” the nuclear option as they call it. And they’ll do that… Not a week will go by, probably not a day will go by. But again, Harry Reid did it, that’s why we have so many judges. I want to thank you very much, Harry Reid. Because Harry Reid, he ended the filibuster and I’m going to have 300 judges by the time I finish. 300, it’s a record by the end of the first term. Think of that. It’s a record [inaudible 00:10:49] the term. By the end of the first term, I have 300 judges just about give or take a few couple. And-it’s all because of… Think of it, Sean. It’s all because of Harry Reid and a lot of good work-by a lot of good Republicans including Mitch. Well, he’s got a lot of non-answers. Look at Second Amendment, you never talk about Second Amendment. He wants to take away your guns 100%. He put Beto as a… He turned out to be… He was exposed by Ted Cruz and me, I think I helped a lot too. But he was exposed as a clown, as much worse than that, but I want to be nice, because it’s a nice evening show. But he was exposed as a clown. He wants to take away your guns. He’s going to take away your Second Amendment. Nobody ever… Nobody asks him about the Second Amendment anymore. Do you notice that? The Second Amendment is very important. It’s a big thing that we campaign on it. I protected this. If I weren’t president, you wouldn’t have a Second Amendment right now. And Biden does it. Nobody’s talks about life anymore, pro-life. Is he pro-life? No, he’s not pro-life. What is he? Why don’t you ask him that question? He doesn’t want to talk about it. But he endorsed a Governor of Virginia who not only executed a baby late term abortion, but executed a baby because he said the baby can be born and then you can kill the baby. He’s totally in favor of that. I can tell you, your pro-life groups are… They’re in mess. This is their one shot because what’s going on is so bad. It’s so evil. The governor of Virginia said, we will execute the baby after the baby is born, that’s… When you talk about late term abortion, this is early term execution, and it’s a very, very bad thing. But you don’t ever hear everybody talking about pro-life, pro-choice with Biden. Did you ever hear it? I haven’t heard it. Very rarely do you hear it? I don’t think he’d know how to discuss it. But very importantly, a Second Amendment. They just don’t discuss the Second Amendment. He’s going to take your guns away. So everybody with a gun, you can’t vote for him because you’re not going to have your gun. At the same time, they want to defund the police. So if you’re not going to have police protection and by the way, you can’t have a gun. So if one of these maniacs breaks into your house at night because there are no cops around and you don’t have a gun to protect yourself, that’s a great combination. The suburbs are going to fall. A lot of people talk about the women of the suburbs. Women of the suburbs, they do or don’t like Trump. I don’t know. But what I’ve done is incredible for the suburbs. The suburbs are over as you know. The suburbs have become more unsafe than the cities run by the Democrats. And so I think I should do very well with suburban women, because I’m the one that’s protecting them both in terms of law and order and in terms of zoning. They want to build low-income housing right next to your house as the American dream is destroyed, but they don’t talk to Biden about this. They don’t talk to him about law and order. I said to him the other night, “Mention the words law and order.” He wouldn’t do it. He wouldn’t do it. I said, “Don’t mention the word law and order. Go ahead.” He wouldn’t do it. And then of course Chris Wallace came in to protect him. And I condemn the people on the left like Antifa that are burning down your cities all summer long and without any control whatsoever. They’re all Biden people, meaning not Biden. Biden’s not smart enough to know what the hell it even is, but they’re of that philosophy. I condemn them very strongly, very, very strongly. It’s not just the right. It’s the right, it’s the left. But the left has been the problem up for a long time. Antifa is a big, big problem. I see Whitmer today, she’s complaining, but it was our justice department that arrested the people that she was complaining about. It was my justice department that arrested them. But instead, she goes and does her little political act and she keeps her state closed although we just won the big case as you know to open up Michigan, because what she’s doing is a horrible thing to the people. The churches are closed, the schools are closed and all state is closed. People are being hurt very badly by it in the form of drinking and suicides and depression. It’s a very sad thing. But now, Joe Biden wants to raise taxes. And very sadly, if you take a look, he wants to raise taxes, but he says he’s going to end our tax cut. Well, people are getting actually much more. Mike [Inaudible 00:00:17:23], he said 2000 was actually much more than $2,000 in child tax credits, which is a $1000 a child. but he wants to take all that away. So therefore, if you do nothing else, you’re raising taxes by the largest percentage in the history of our country. If he terminated my tax cuts, which is one of the reasons that our economy has done so great, even now in this pandemic which hopefully we’re rounding the turn and we have incredible cures and a lot of therapeutics and the vaccines are going to be coming very soon. But I’ll tell you what I took is incredible. To me, I viewed it as a cure. It’s incredible, and we’re going to get it to everybody free of charge. It’s going to hospitals. Starting very soon, the military is going to be delivering it. But he’s looking to do big, big tax cuts, big, big tax increases at a level that’s never been seen. Nobody’s ever gotten the cuts that I got. I got the biggest tax cuts ever given as you know Sean, better than probably most. But he’s going to end those tax cuts and reverse them. And now, people are going to pay $2000 plus child tax credits, all that. It’s going to be a disaster for our country. It’s going to put our country into a depression. Your 401ks are going to go down the tubes, and your jobs are going to go away, and you’re going to have a depression the likes of which our country has never seen before. And that possibly includes 1929. Well, it’s a deal that was conceived up by not smart people, AOC plus 3 and others, but I don’t even think they had any experience in the environment. But this was a deal conceived up. The real price is $100 trillion. That’s more money that this country could make in 100 years if things went well. They literally want to take buildings down and rebuild them with tiny little windows. Little windows, so you can’t see out, you can see the light. The whole thing is so crazy. It’s such a crazy thing. Take a look, Biden agreed to this with crazy Bernie, because they have the manifesto. They’ve agreed to most of these things, and it’s going to cost more money. Our country will be a Ninth World country, not a Third World country, a Ninth World country. We won’t have energies. Look at what’s happening with the rolling blackouts in California? Looking at where California is going to have to ration water? You know why? Because they set millions of gallons of water out to sea, out to the Pacific because they want to take care of certain little tiny fish that aren’t doing very well without water to be honest with you. But it’s a very sad thing that’s happening. It’s still common sense. Even the fires in California. I talk about, you need...I was with governor Newsom. I get along with him very well. We disagree on a lot of things, but I get along with him. Number one, you should let water come down from the North and accept it instead of throwing it out to the Pacific. But you also have to have forest management. We send them so much money. I don’t have to, but I want to help California. But they have the biggest forest fires because they don’t manage their land. They don’t have separators. They have trees that have been laying on the ground that are stone cold dead, dry like a matchstick. You throw a cigarette butts on between the leaves and the trees, everything catches on fire. You lose 200,000 acres in a short period of time. They get to manage their forest. And if they manage their forest, you’re not going to see the forest fires. Well, I want them to vote, but I will say this, absentee is okay, because absentee ballots… Excuse me. Absentee ballots are fine, because absentee ballots, you request, you ask for a ballot and you request and that’s it. Absentee ballots are absolutely fine. You request them, you fill them in, you send them back in. But these unsolicited ballots, universal unsolicited ballots Sean, it’s going to be a disaster the likes of which we’ve never seen. We will never have seen an election like what’s going to take place. Thousands of ballots all over the country are being reported. Some thrown in garbage cans with my name on them. Some thrown in trays in a river. What’s going on is absolutely crazy. We have people watching. We have US attorneys watching. We have sheriffs watching. We have US Marshals watching. But with all of that-you're talking about millions of ballots are being sent out-big and tremendous fraud. Well, my supporters are going to be mostly people that vote. They go to the vote the old fashioned where it’s like go to the voting booth and vote, which first of all, we should have voter ID all over the country. We don’t. When you buy something, you have voter ID. To get into the Democrat National Convention, you had to have voter ID. Right. But to get into vote, you don’t need voter ID in many places. In many places, you do. Indiana has a great system. You have many places where you do have it. But we should have voter ID, universal voter ID. When you go to vote, they should see who you are, make sure that it’s not fraudulent. But this will be one of the greatest fraudulent, most fraudulent elections ever because of this whole thing with… They’re sending out millions and millions and millions of ballots. Where are they sending them? Who’s sending them? Where are they going? Where are they coming back from? How many are fraudulent? Are they being thrown away? Are they being sold? Are they being harvested? It’s a terrible thing, Sean. Despite that, I think we’re going to have a tremendous victory. I saw some polls just now, some real polls not the fake news polls where they put out fake numbers like at CNN and ABC, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, NBC. It’s the same stuff as I had. It’s not nearly as bad as it used to be. It used to be much worse believe it or not. It’s hard to believe when you think of it. But I’m looking at polls that are doing great. We’re doing great in Ohio. We’re doing great in Iowa. We’re doing great in many, many places, many places. Then you come home, you turn on television. You say, gee, I’m four down. I can’t believe it. But they’re the fake polls. We caught them spying on our campaign. This is treason. We caught them trying to take down a duly elected administration/ president. We have all the evidence down. Now, we have to see what the law enforcement’s going to do with it, but we caught them spying. As sure as you’re sitting there, I assume you’re sitting, but as-sure as you’re sitting there, we caught them spying on our campaign. You know that almost better than anybody. And it’s something when you see the New York times, Washington Post get [inaudible 00:26:14] surprises they got everything wrong. They get everything wrong. We caught them spying in our campaign. We caught them trying to take down a duly elected… And then they talk about, we want a peaceful transition of power. Peaceful-answer was that answer last night. Peaceful transition. Look what they did. They spent three and a half years trying to terminate a presidency. It's doing really well. Thank you very much. Thank you, Sean.
















"
"81","10-09-20","Go ahead. Well, I want to thank you Rush, you’re a fantastic man, a friend of mine. But before I really even knew you as a friend, you were a supporter. And I said, “I know that guy, he’s got a big audience.” But I never even knew the importance of what you do and what you say, and now I do very well. And it keeps us all in the game. And we just got great polls out of, you probably heard, out of Arizona, we’re getting them out of Nevada. The real polls, not the fake polls. We’re getting them out of North Carolina, looking really good. I think Pennsylvania is looking good. Florida is looking great. It’s all a big phony deal they have going Rush, and we’re going to win this. I think it’s going to be a bigger win than we had four years ago. Well, I appreciate it. And when you suggested this, I immediately jumped on it because your audiences is the biggest. I mean, it’s just incredible. And we have some great friends in Sean Hannity, and so many others, and Mark, and so many people are so great to us. But we have so many people that are so untruthful. And the biggest thing, and the one thing I haven’t figured out is why. If we say we’re going to create a strong military and protect, we’re going to create a strong economy like we’ve never had an economy prior to the plague, and that we’re building it up again stronger than before. Watch, it’s going to be stronger than before. We’re almost at record stock market. Nobody can believe that. And we’re rounding the turn on the pandemic, and I’ll have something to say about that. Because I’m telling you, we have a cure. More than just a therapeutic. We have a cure. But so many things that we’ve done, and no matter what you do, they try and find fault. And not only fault, vicious, they’re vicious people. And you say, why wouldn’t they want to have good education, a good military, a strong economy, safety, security? Why would they want to live like they live in Portland, and where they just allow these agitators and anarchists to run the streets? Why would they want that? That’s the only thing I haven’t figured out. Why would they? And why would these big companies like Comcast, I call it Concast. It’s Comcast, but I call it Concast because it’s a con job. That’s NBC mostly. But if you look at that or CNN, which is so pathetic, why would they do that? Why would they want to have a country that’s in turmoil? Because they create it. The fake news is the worst thing we have going. The lame stream, I call it the lame stream media. But you’d think that they’d want to see great education, great country, great security, strong military. It’s a crazy thing, Rush. It’s the one thing I’ve never quite figured it out, you know? And they become less wealthy. To a large extent, they become less wealthy. And they’re willing to give up their wealth in order to see the country go to hell. Some day when you figure that out, you’re going to let me know. Okay, I’ll tell you, it’s such a great question. And I’d do it again, even though it’s far worse. I never thought I’d be involved with a Russia hoax or a Ukraine hoax, or be impeached because I made a phone call congratulating somebody that I never met to or spoke to on becoming the President of Ukraine. And all of a sudden you get impeached. And it was a perfect phone call. A letter that we actually… Fortunately, we had it transcribed, because they made up the phone call. They said it was totally different. Fortunately, or maybe I wouldn’t be talking to you right now in this capacity at least, fortunately we had it transcribed. It was transcribed, the exact call. If we didn’t, you know what Schiff said, he said it before Congress, he repeated my call. It had no bearing on what I said. It was a perfect phone call, and I got impeached over it. I never knew it would be so unpleasant. But nobody has done more in the last three and a half years as president, in the first three and a half years that I have. Nobody. I mean, if you look at rebuilding the military and the economy, and the best employment numbers we’ve ever had. And we’ve cut regulations to a point that’s so incredible nobody’s ever seen. If you look at the Veterans Choice and the VA Accountability, we had people in the VA that would beat up our veterans, and beat them up badly. You know, they’re infirm, they’re not well, they’re not feeling well. And then you had these animals in there that would beat them up, we couldn’t do anything about them. Now with accountability, you have to account. And we fire them, and worse, we get rid of them. And our vets have a 91% approval rating, the highest we’ve ever had in the VA. You don’t hear those bad stories about the VA anymore like he used to. And now they get immediate doctor attention, if they have to wait on line. I mean, but that’s so many different things. Right to try, where they can try medicines. And I mean, I can give you an example of that with the COVID. Because I was in not great shape, and we have a medicine that healed me, that fixed me. It’s a great medicine. And had I not gotten it, Rush, it would have been in line for another year probably before they brought it out. Great company, two great companies actually make it, make very similar things. But they both work equally well. And we’re going to send it, we’re already sending it and starting the processes. Hundreds of thousands of vials are being sent to the hospitals all over the country. People are going to get immediately better, like I did. I mean, I feel better now than I did two weeks ago. It’s crazy. And I recovered immediately, almost immediately. I might not have recovered at all from COVID. To me, it’s the biggest story, but the press doesn’t even want to report that. They talk about the vaccines, and the vaccines are very important, Rush. But this is more important because we can go into hospitals and clean out the hospitals, literally, with people that… The vaccines are very important, it’s just a different stage. … antibody. This is the antibody. And Regeneron, it’s the most unbelievable thing I’ve ever seen. And I had a meeting with doctors today. It’s always the good thing about when you’re president, 11 doctors show up and they’re all the head of Johns Hopkins and this and that. They’re great people. But Walter Reed is an incredible place. And these 11 guys came in today, they showed me stats. It’s amazing. I don’t know that I would have… I was not in the greatest of shape, a day later I was fine, maybe perfect. But I was fine. But a couple of days later, now I’m free. I feel perfect. I’m not taking anything, I’m off any regimen that they gave me. But it was primarily this one drug. And we’re sending that and the Eli Lilly version of it, which is very similar, we’re sending that to all of our hospitals. We’re going to get people better. We got to get it there fast, that’s why I’m doing an emergency use authorization, I got to get them to approve it really fast. But I gave them my numbers to put in with the other numbers that they already have, which are very good. Excellent. And it’s the most amazing thing. And it’s not Remdesivir, maybe that helps a little bit. But Remdesivir is not the same thing. This is stuff that is so good, it just wiped out the virus. It wiped it out. It’s the most...such a big story to me. Well there’s always that little lingering thing for a couple of days, but no, my voice is now perfect. I mean, for a couple of days you have, it’s called the lingering thing. If you have hay fever, if you have something, you have that too a wee little bit. But no, this is the most amazing thing that’s happened. And I was asking the doctors today, 11 guys, great people, the heads of the biggest hospitals. It’s amazing. I guess the President has a lot of power, but everybody shows up. What do you do? I’m the head of Johns Hopkins. Or, I’m the head of stuff. But they’re very brilliant people. And I said, “How bad was I?” They said, “You could have been very bad. You were going into a very bad phase.” And so it wasn’t like it was just going to, like with the kids where they get it and it get sniffles and they’re better two days later, right? This looks like it was going to be a big deal. And you know what that means, right? That means bad. Because I’ve lost five people, at least five people that were friends of mine. One in particular, an incredible guy who went in there. Went into the hospital, he was dead within three days. And I’m just saying that we have something that will cure this now. And a cure. And without us, without Trump administration, this would never have happened. We poured money into these cures, and we poured money into the vaccines. And the vaccines are coming along great, Rush. I mean the vaccines, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, Pfizer. They’re all coming along great. A little bit political, they’re afraid it’s going to go too fast and I’ll get credit for it before the election. Well first of all, it’s such a great question. And most people can’t understand it. As an example, I was nominated for two Nobel Peace Prizes. One for-Oh, that’s good. Well, it won’t be written about. When Obama got it, it was the biggest story, I remember very well. He didn’t even know why he got it. He got it almost-That’s right. He didn’t know. He couldn’t explain why he got it, but I can. And one is Middle East peace without any blood. Okay. And by the way, countries are lining up. The other is, if you look at Kosovo and Serbia, they’ve been killing each other forever. And I got them to be peace and good stuff. And then I just heard about the third. Nobody even wrote it. It wasn’t even on the news, okay? I joke about it in speeches sometimes, I’ll joke about it. I say, “I tell my wife, let’s watch tonight. It’ll be a wonderful night.” And they don’t even cover it. They don’t cover any good stuff with me. Anything that’s good they don’t cover. Anything that’s okay, or bad. I mean, bad, they make it sound like let’s do the electric chair thing. The media are the most dishonest people I’ve ever met. And that’s why I go back to the original. I just don’t know why. I mean, they can’t hate somebody so much, but I guess they do. But they do it with Republican conservatives. I mean, you’ve had it before I came along. But I don’t think never to this extent. You know they say, that Newt Gingrich, they said that the one that got worse than me was Abraham Lincoln. I said, “I disagree.” They say Abraham Lincoln was just decimated by the press. I said, “Maybe he was, but it couldn’t be worse.” If I do something good, they make it look bad. If I do something okay, they make it look horrible, horrible. And the reason I talk, and I say it, you might as well talk about it yourself because nobody else will. If I give it to our very good people, Kayleigh, and we have a lot of good people at the White House. If I give it to them to go out, they won’t report it. And did you ever see the way the press, the hostility of the press, the way they scream at these very nice people. They’ll make just an ordinary statement and they’ll start screaming like a bunch of maniacs. The media. It's just incredible. They are sick, it's crazy. Go ahead. Yeah. Which is false. Well Rush, remember how big the wall was? Everything was the wall, the wall, the wall, and it got bigger and bigger because they figured it was no way to get it financed because it’s massive. You know it’s thousands of miles. The whole thing is, it’s a massive project. It’s one of the biggest. It’s actually one of the biggest projects, government projects ever. Anyway, so we’re building the wall, we’re up to 380 miles of wall. Had a huge impact. Nobody gets through this wall. This wall is everything the border patrol wanted. I built it exactly. I didn’t even agree with them on certain parts of it, but I think they were right. They had to have see-through. They had to have this, they had to have that. It’s lined up with all sorts of wires and everything, you can imagine. It is the best. Okay? It’s the best. And it’s had an impact that you wouldn’t believe. And nobody thought I was going to get it done. Now it’s almost completed, it will be completed toward the end of the year. Very soon. And it will be about 535 miles. We may have even extended beyond that. But you have a lot of natural barriers, rivers, and mountains and other things that really do a pretty good job. But we’re going to have it finished very soon. You don’t even hear about it anymore. And you don’t hear about how great the border numbers are. People today, I ended catch and release, which was not easy. Because I had to go through the Democrats. You used to catch somebody, they’d release them into our country. And they’d come back four years later, but nobody would ever come back for a court case. It was the craziest thing. You’d catch somebody, even a murderer, and then you’d release them into our country. And then you’d say, you have to be back here in two and a half years to go to trial. And nobody would come back, only the very dumbest would come back. Okay? And that was about 1%. No, that was about 1%. And it was crazy, catch and release. I mean, there were many programs like that, we got rid of most of them. And it’s not easy to get rid of them, you had to go through all sorts of hoops. But I got rid of catch and release. We have a very good border now. Now only people that come in legally are coming in. Well, the wall made a tremendous difference. But you notice, you never hear about the wall anymore. Right. That's right. They don’t talk about immigration. And we have immigration down really good. In fact, I was going to do an immigration bill. I have it all done. And then my guy said, “Why bring it up, sir? You have the same policies that you’re already implementing. Why should you go through the controversy of it?” I mean, we have a great… The people that wanted the wall, generally love what I’ve done. I mean, because what we’ve done, and immigration. Generally. We’ve got a couple hard liners out there, friends of yours. But the people that wanted the wall, I’ve done far more than I thought. Our immigration now, because it wasn’t just the wall, it’s the wall, but we had to cut a lot of these crazy things out. I mean, you have chain migration where somebody comes in illegally. And we have a killer who killed eight people on the West side highway, ran over eight people. A terrorist, jihadist, came in through the Southern border. And through chain migration, the chain, he brings in his mother, his father, his grandmother, his aunts, his brothers, his uncles. He brings in all these people. And I say, “Wait a minute.” And what we’ve done is incredible, on immigration. Think of it, you have killers that come in, and because of chain migration they’re allowed to bring other people. They don’t want to talk to me about it. So many things like sanctuary cities. The people in California hate sanctuary cities. I don’t know where it gets this political stamina, because the people in California, they see me all the time. I think we’ll do well in California. I mean, in theory you don’t win California, because everybody likes to vote three times. Okay? If you want to know the truth. I don’t know if you ever saw the list, but Oh, the whole thing is crazy. But the people they want to vote, they vote numerous times, numerous times. And it’s disgraceful. But the people in California, they don’t like sanctuary cities. What are you doing with a sanctuary? You’re protecting criminals. Who wants that? And I’ve had so many people, liberal friends of mine from California. “We’d love to get rid of sanctuary cities.” Well that thug from, as you know, Kate’s Law. Remember Kate’s Law, [crosstalk 00:24:19] which should have been… We tried like hell to get it passed. We left the filibuster, okay? We should have gotten rid of the filibuster. Only because I said, “Schumer’s going to do it.” I told Mitch. I said, “Mitch.” I get along great with Mitch. We had the greatest success in history on judges. We’ll be up to 300 judges and two Supreme Court judges. And now three. Hopefully that’ll go quickly. I think she’s going to go very quickly. So I have three Supreme Court judges. But in the first term, they’ll go nuclear, as you know. And that’ll be the end of the filibuster. And they’ll approve stuff left and right, 50%, they’ll go left and right. And that’s the problem I had with it. It’s not that they’re not right, they did it the right way. Harry Reed, we got lucky because Harry Reed thought that Hillary was going to win. And he knocked out the filibuster for the judges. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have 300 judges, I’d have two judges. It’s such an interesting question, because I have done more. We have a list of things that we’ve done. Just go down the list. Even Space Force, that’s a big deal. First in 75 years, right? A new branch of the United States military. That, by itself, is an achievement that you could just do that and you’ve had a successful thing. Space Force, think of it. The Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard. We have Space Force, and that’s a big deal. And it’s going to be very important, especially as the future, as it goes. Maybe the most important. But so many things I’ve done, and it’s incredible, people don’t want to talk about it. But I’ll tell you the amazing thing, the one thing I really have learned. The people of our country are smarter than the people that cover them. Because they get it. How can I be in a position where I’m leading in a lot of states? I mean, don’t believe these fake polls. These fake polls, I don’t know if you have a look at them. I don’t even know why they have to put it down, I think there’s a legal reason. But they put down where they interviewed 18% more Democrats than Republicans, Trump is losing by five. Do you understand what I mean? I still don’t know why. (silence) I think there’s a legal reason, because they always say who they interviewed. But when you look down at what they call the tabs, one of them said, “18% more Democrats”. Another one said 14%. Well let’s assume the Democrats are going to vote for sleepy Joe. Which is ridiculous, because Joe shouldn’t be a candidate. Joe is in no condition to be a candidate. … nicely, or we can say it badly. The 25th amendment that crazy Nancy’s playing around with, she’s gone crazy. She’s a nut job. But this 25th amendment, I think they put it in so they can get Kamala in, replace Joe. That was the first thing I thought of. And by the way, the Republicans have been really very good to me. One thing the Republicans have to do though, they have to get tougher. We have some great ones, you know that. Jim Jordan and Meadows has been great. A lot of them. A lot of them have been great. But the Republicans have to get tougher. The Democrats play a much dirtier game. Like impeaching on a phone call. I’ll never forget, “Sir, did you call the President of Ukraine?” “Yeah, I did. Why?” “Just to congratulate.” I had five guys begging me to call him to congratulate. I never met him before, what do I care? So they said, “Did you call the President?” “Yes.” “Well, what did you say?” I said, “I don’t know. A couple of months ago. I called him to congratulate him because he became president. Why what’s [inaudible 00:00:29:26]?” “Sir, they want to impeach you for that call.” I said, ” Impeach me for the call? Impeach me for something, but you can’t impeach me. What did I do? I said congratulations.” It’s unbelievable. By the way, when they found out, they believe the Schiff version of the call. Which he made up standing in front of Congress, okay? Schiff is a real crook. He made it up. He said eight times quid pro quo. Think of what eight times is. That would mean it’s eight times you’ve asked for something illegal on a call. Right? Think of what that means. If the person on the other side of the call, if you did it once, maybe. Twice, maybe. If you did it eight times, I think you’re certifiably insane. Right? So Schiff made up the call. And I said, “Well, there’s nothing wrong with the call.” We actually took the call, because we had the transcript, fortunately. If we didn’t have a transcript, I don’t know. Would have been my word against a lot of these crooked people. But I actually sent it to the Department of Justice, to some division. And they called up, they said, to my people, “Okay, so what are we looking for here?” In other words, these are guys that look at drug deals and murderers. And they’re going like, “Okay. Explain to us, what are we supposed to…” In other words, after having read the call they’ll say, “What the hell is wrong with this thing. Right?” They impeached me. They are meaner and they are… But they have bad policy, open borders, sanctuary cities, high taxes. Right. And has great potential. And America has great potential too. Because any shortcomings, we can solve those shortcomings, but they’re going to make them much shorter. America has tremendous potential. When you look at what we’ve done with energy, and they want to take that advantage away and give it to these other countries that are going to always have energy. When you look at the environment, very important. I love the environment. I want clean air, I want clean water. By the way, our carbon-Oh, it's unbelievable. Yeah, it's unbelievable. Like the forest fires in California. If we had forest management, you wouldn’t have any forest fires. In Europe, you go there, they have forest nations, they call them, Austria, different places. They don’t have the woods burning down, and their trees are more explosive than ours, meaning explosive from potential fire. They have trees, and they maintain their forests. They put cuts in between, so if they have a fire, it doesn’t burn down a half a million acres. They do it properly. Our people don’t do that. Then we talk about they want our air clean, but they don’t talk about China, Russia, India, these other countries where the pollution is massive going up. We have a clean spot on a massive planet. We have a clean spot, which is a small percentage of the planet, a very small percentage of the planet. Then China is spewing crap, and Russia and all of these other… India. Did you ever see what they dump into the ocean that floats into California? It’s unbelievable. We end up cleaning it up, and then they say, well, the environment, the environment. I could tell you hundreds of stories. A lot of what you and I talk about is really based on common sense. People say, “Are you a conservative?” I say, “No, I’m common sense.” Yeah, that's true. That's very true. That's great. Well, I think you’re gonna see that, Rush. I think you’re going to see that come November 3rd and a little before that because our people don’t want to send in these fake ballots that are being fraudulently made all over the place-Yeah, I think you're going to see it. I will. The Democrats are vicious, and they lie. What they do is, as an example, healthcare and other things, they have me standing at a grave of a beautiful soldier in an old cemetery, magnificent cemetery. And nobody respects soldiers more than I do, especially whether you’re talking about live soldiers or soldiers that gave their lives. They have a source say these are suckers and losers. This was for a magazine that’s third-rate, super liberal Obama magazine, and it’s a quote. They took that quote from one source. I have 25 people that verbally on the record said that was never said. Who would ever say that? Only an animal would say that. I know some very bad people. Nobody do I know that would say a thing like that. They put it in ads, they make it like I said it. I never said it, just the opposite. I’ve taken care of the military better than anybody. They do the same thing with healthcare. They will make up a statement that’s so bad. Now, preexisting conditions, I’m totally for it, but I’m against Obamacare because Obamacare is too expensive. I already got rid of the individual mandate, which was the worst part of Obamacare. That’s where you had to pay a fortune for the privilege of not paying for bad health insurance. You understand that, right? So I got rid of it, and I got rid of it through the law. I got rid of it in our tax decrease. We got the biggest tax decrease in the history of our country. We would have never been able to build up the economy if we didn’t get that. But one of the things I got in there, I got rid of the individual mandate. What I want to do is… And we’re fighting to terminate. Sort of I have terminated Obamacare, because once you get rid of the individual mandate it’s no longer Obamacare. But I had a choice to make, Rush. It was a big choice. Do I maintain Obamacare, the remnants of Obamacare after the mandate? Do I maintain it well, or do I run it badly? I could have done it either way. I have very good people over there, Alex Azar and Seema, the whole group. I said, you know what, we’ve got to run it as well as it can be run. I have no choice. I could have run it badly and made everybody angry, but I didn’t do that. I ran it really well. Knowing that it’s run really well, it’s still no good. It’s still not good. It’s much better than when they ran it. They couldn’t even do… Remember, they spent $5 billion on the server, if you remember. They couldn’t get the server right. That's correct. Come up with a great health care plan that’s much less expensive and does include people with preexisting conditions, that’s what I want to do. Now, they’ll also say about Social Security-That’s right. In order to do that… Well, what will happen is if we win, the Democrats will do something to help get healthcare. They’re going to come along because they have no choice. They’re going to come along. They have no choice. I will say one thing. We talk about unity, because I’d like to see the country come together. It’s not as easy as people think. But just prior to the plague coming in from China, when the plague came in from China, we had the lowest unemployment we’ve ever had. We had the best employment. We were up to 160 million people employed. We never were even close. Everybody had a job. Everybody was happy-Ever. That’s right, Rush. We had the best numbers ever. We had the highest stock market. Although I tell you, we’re inches away right now for people’s 401(k)s. If they held on to their stocks, they’re very wealthy right now. And our economy is doing really amazing, considering that we’re in this pandemic thing sent to us by China. But if you look at what we’ve done, and people were calling me, Rush, in terms of bringing our country together, that I really had never heard from before. In other words, they were not interested. They were saying like, “Let’s start getting together.” It was coming together. Success was bringing our country together, and then we got hit by the China plague. But success, Rush, even you might be surprised to hear that. People that you would have said “no way” were calling and saying, “Can we get together?” And it was coming together because success… I’ve always said success will bring us together. Our military is strong. When I took over we had no ammunition. We had a case where a certain general, highly overrated general, told me, “We have no ammunition.” I said, “What are you talking about?” I said, “No president should ever be told that again.” Now we have so much ammunition-He said, “Sir, we have no ammunition.” Okay? I said, “Keep that very quiet.” Then we started building up, and now we have new rockets, new missiles. We have stuff the likes of which nobody… Russia dreams of the stuff that we have. China dreams of the stuff that we have, Rush, and we can’t talk about it, or we shouldn’t talk about it. We have things that I hope to God we never have to use it. Our nuclear is all tippy top now. You don’t want to even say it. We have no choice but to say it. We were so far behind. If you look, I call them Obiden, Obama and Biden, what they did to our military, it just was horrible. That's right. No manufacturing. Right. But it was coming together, Rush. And I’m telling you, and you would be a skeptic maybe almost more than-People were coming together for the first time. For the first time-I think so. That's true. Go ahead. I’ve watched this for a long time. I’ve had it. I’ve probably been a victim of it, you and I and a couple of others, more than anybody, and we’re just the opposite. When they give up, when we’re beating them, they have nothing else to fall back on but the word racist. That means that when you’re winning and you’re just knocking the hell out of them, they have nothing else to say; they call you a racist. This has been going on for decades. I don’t know that you’re going to stop it, but people are wise to it and people are rolling their eyes now. They’re rolling their eyes. It is just an incredible thing. The way they use the racist word is actually disgusting. I was asked by Chris Wallace, who’s third-rate, I was asked by him… He was protecting Biden the other night. It was pathetic. I couldn’t even ask him, “Why did you get $3.5 million from the mayor’s wife of Moscow? Why did you say, ‘A billion dollars unless you get rid of the prosecutor,’ and then you give them the billion dollars?” He was choking like a dog. He wasn’t able to answer, and Chris Wallace would go in and save him every time. That whole thing was disgraceful, but whenever you-What? Oh yeah, absolutely. Okay, go. Well, I think it’s terrible, and you can look at so many other things. Look at fracking. He went for a whole year saying, “No way there’ll be fracking. Mark my words. There will not be fracking,” and so did Kamala. You know Kamala. She’s another great one. They talk about fracking-I thought she was so… Mike beat her so badly the other night. But she’s just not good at what she did. Hey, don’t forget, she started off… She only went down in the polls. That’s usually not the person you want to pick to run for vice president. Anyway, but the both of them, they talk about fracking like it was the greatest sin on earth, then they get the nomination and now they’re talking about they want to do fracking. I find in politics, always follow their first words, because that’s where they’re going. They have no choice. They agreed with Bernie Sanders and all the people on the manifesto. If you read that manifesto, that manifesto is further left than Bernie Sanders, much further left than Bernie Sanders. Usually you think they take them right. Bernie took them left. He took them left of where he was. But if you look at the fracking, the coal, you could say the coal, remember Hillary, three weeks before she went to West Virginia, she was knocking the hell out of coal, and then she forgot she had to go to West Virginia. So she goes to West Virginia and she sat at the table with the miners, and it was just the end of her when she knocked the coal. What they do with coal now, with clean coal, is amazing. We have more than anybody. What they do with clean coal is amazing. We have more energy than anybody, and these other countries who want to take it away with the Paris Accord and all of this, they want to take away our wealth. They want to take away our jobs, our companies. It is disgraceful. Well, basically it’s getting energy out of the ground really efficiently and getting every drop of it. It’s created wealth for our country like you wouldn’t believe. It’s really been over the last small number of years that that’s really become… You used to see these massive oil wells and-They drill sideways. They can drill up and down and around. It’s unbelievable, if you ever watched this process, and they just suck stuff out of the ground that is… It’s just incredible, the technology. And for whatever reason, for our country… We’ve become the biggest oil producer in the world right now by far, not even a contest. We’re bigger than Russia, bigger than Saudi Arabia. It’s good to get along with countries, not necessarily a bad thing, Rush, you understand that, and they cut 10 million barrels a day. It’s actually more than that, but they cut, and we saved the oil. We saved 10 million jobs in this country, and yet everybody has cheap gasoline. Look at the gasoline at $2 a gallon. Nobody thought that would be possible. That’s better than a tax cut. If you want to know the truth, when gas used to go up to $5, $6, and people would say, “Oh, our country,” and they couldn’t buy cars. They couldn’t do anything. We have very inexpensive gasoline, and yet it’s high enough that we have our energy jobs. We have millions and millions of energy jobs in Texas and North Dakota and Oklahoma and Pennsylvania. So Biden goes in. Do you notice they never talk about fracking? He said no fracking, and he’s in Pennsylvania-No. I know. It’s incredible what he said yesterday. I couldn’t believe it, and that’s such a big thing. But think of it. He’s in Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania’s a big, big fracking thing. It’s a million jobs. It’s tremendous energy. They have low-energy cars-He said just the opposite. He said, “There will be no fracking,” and then once he gets to Pennsylvania, he said, “No, there will be fracking.” I couldn’t get away with that. Nobody could get away with that. But they let him. They don’t even ask him a question about fracking. They don’t say to him, “Well, wait a minute. You said you won’t frack, and now you’re saying you’re gonna frack,” because if Pennsylvania believed that, they couldn’t vote for him because he’d put Pennsylvania out of business, along with Ohio and other places. No, he doesn’t get called. I will say this, though. The black community gets it. They don’t dig him. They don’t like him. They don’t like him, and I’m getting numbers. We’re at 20%, 22%, not that I’m proud of that, because it should be 100%. But if you look at what I’ve done for criminal justice reform, Obama couldn’t get criminal justice reform done. I did prison reform. The small colleges and universities, historically black, what I’ve done, I got them funded. They were coming back every year hat in hand, every year begging for money, and I got them taken care of for a 10-year period, all funded, fully funded. What I’ve done is then with Tim Scott, we did the opportunity zones, which is the greatest, the most incredible thing for the black community, the African-American community, with jobs and everything else. No, I’ve done more… I say it. At first, people said, “Oh, it’s too much to say.” I said, “I’ve done more for the black community than anybody since Abraham Lincoln,” and it’s true. Nobody’s done what I’ve done. They don’t like Biden. They don’t like Biden. He did the super predator stuff. He was the super predator king. But he’s a different guy there. You could hear by the way he talks. He’s out of it. Look, he’s out of it. Now, we can’t have a president that’s out of it, because I meet with Xi and I meet with Putin. I meet with all of them. That’s right. He’s a different guy. He’s out of it. He’s in a daze. I look at the things he says. I look at what he says. I look at the way he says it. He’s in a daze. And it’s not because he’s 78 or whatever he is, because I know guys that are 92. Bernie Marcus from Home Depot, he’s 100% sharp. But Joe, there’s something wrong. We can’t have that. We can’t have that. I agree, but he was not able to answer the-I know, highest number ever recorded that they’re better off today than they were at any time before, during a pandemic. That’s what I’ve built. We’ve built this, and the only reason we’re doing well is because the foundation was so strong, Rush, the foundation. If we didn’t have a strong foundation, you’d be 1929. And if he got in, you’ll be 1929, because he’s going to raise everybody’s taxes. They don’t talk about that either. He’s going to raise everybody’s taxes. And you know what else they never talk about? Something that I think is a very important thing, the Second Amendment. They don’t say that he’s going to take away your guns. They never talk about it. That’s right. That’s right. It’s pretty crazy. It’s amazing that here we sit in the White House. Every once in a while, I’ll say, “It’s not fair the way I get treated,” and then I’m sitting in the Oval and I’ll say, “Oh, this is the Oval Office.” It’s pretty amazing, and it’s because the people get it. The people of this country are really smart, and they do get it. The people of the country get it. Well, I’m glad you said it, because if I say it… You said before something, “Why do you say it yourself?” Because I have to, and because nobody else will say it. I tell that to people, “You might as well say it yourself because nobody else is going to say it.” I don’t like saying it. I wish other people would say it, and I love that you can say it. .But the truth is I am a wall, just like the wall we’re building, I’m a wall in between this incredible thing that has such potential. We have something with such potential, you have no idea. Even you might not understand. … take our wealth away. They want to take our jobs away, our factories away. They want us to be in the same position. We’re born on very, very energy… You look at the energy we have, more than anybody in the world. You look. They want to take all of these advantages that we have over other countries and throw them away. .We have such incredible potential, and they want to… I am a wall between the potential of this country to be better than ever before and a country that will become a Third World country, a Venezuela. I used to say we could be Venezuela. I used to say it halfheartedly. It’s true. It’ll be just a massive version. If you look at Venezuela, it’s a massive version of Venezuela. You remember Venezuela 20 years ago-You've got a lot of wealthy friends. Venezuela has gotten so bad, it’s… They don’t have food. They don’t have water. They don’t have medicine. They have lots of wealth too. They have oil. They have lots of wealth, but they have nothing. They’ve gone socialist and probably more. If you look at Kamala, that’s more than socialist. She’s further left than Crazy Bernie, and this is what they want. They wanted her. I don’t know why. I don’t know if they’re happy with her. I think she’s not a good-That’s right. She was so bad, she left before Iowa. And look at Iowa, by the way. You remember the Iowa… Nobody even knows to this day who won Iowa, right? They went with this scheme that now they want to multiply times a thousand on the voting stuff, and wait until you see. I’m sure that you’ll have a question about that, but wait until you see how bad the ballot thing… .All over the country, thousands of ballots are being thrown away and defrauded and cut up, and when they talk about other countries coming in, it’s a lot easier for them to print illegal ballots, I guess you’d say counterfeit ballots, than it is some of the other things that you’re talking about. It’s one scary thing when they send out millions and millions of ballots. You say, “Who’s sending them? Where are they sending them? Who’s bringing them? Who’s reporting them? Who’s signing them?” Millions and millions of ballots. It’s a disgrace, and look at all of the bad things that have happened over the last year with the ballots. Look at Carolyn Maloney’s race in New York, a small race, where so many ballots have been defrauded-Every day. Yes. I'd love to. Well, I’m going to get that one. I’m going to have to put that one up pretty soon. But look, I’m honored by it, and with time, more and more people see the things we’ve done. I’ve put out lists, and they’re pages and pages long. We’ve done a job, and I’m very honored by it and I’m very proud of it. We’ve helped a lot of people. We’ve helped a lot of people. On the pandemic, I was telling you about this medicine. I’m so proud of it. People don’t want to write about it, but that’s okay. This is better than the vaccine, and it’s going out literally as we speak. The U.S. military logistics, they’re bringing it out. This is such a big thing, but we have done such a good job on the pandemic. We get zero credit. We fed these Governors whose shelves were empty and our shelves were empty too. I say our cupboard was bare. And we filled it up with all sorts of stuff and we send it all over the United States. In New York, we built him convention centers that they should have used. We sent ships that they should have used instead of putting old people with other people that were sick and a lot of problems were caused. The 50 Governors, they’re all saying, “Thank you, thank you, thank you.” Rarely do we have anybody speak up, and when they do, we take care of them. And then they’ll go and they’ll speak to the press and they’ll say, “Well, the President was okay.” What we’ve done for them with the ventilators, the ventilators were an impossible situation. We now build more ventilators by five times than anybody else in the world. We’re supplying them to the world, and they’re very complicated, expensive, et cetera, et cetera. But we’ve done a great job. Oh, it was amazing. One of the biggest, I guess the biggest they say, since the Second World War. But you know what? This is the biggest of all. If the Regeneron and the Lilly comparable drug turns out, this is a cure. This is a therapeutic. Call it what you want. I can tell you, it’s a cure and I’m talking to you today because of it, because I think I could have been a bad victim. I fit certain categories that aren’t so great, okay. And you better be careful too, okay. But I’m telling you, this is a total game changer. It’s so good. And nobody else would have had it. FDA is approving things in one week that used to take three years, and that’s only because I’m bugging them like crazy. I drive them crazy I guess, but that’s okay. But FDA, Food and Drug Administration, is approving things that, Rush, would have taken years and I’m getting them in a matter of weeks and months. And they’re great things, but this is the greatest of them all, if this works out, and I’m very sure it’s going to. When was this announced, Rush? I think it's terrible. Think it's terrible fairly recently. If that’s the case, I’m very disappointed. I think it’s a terrible thing, and I’ll say it to his face. That's a disgrace. I think it's a disgrace. It's an embarrassment. I’ve had to go through it twice now with elections. See, this is what I mean with the Republicans. They don’t play the tough game. They don’t play the tough game. If this were the other side, you would have had 25 people in jail for the rest of their lives, with what we found. Oh, are you kidding me? You would have been 20. Look at me. I had to beat off the phony Mueller Report. I had to beat off all this stuff. I had to beat off impeachment. I had to beat off Congress, everything else. They then send it to New York, which is all political. They send the same stuff into New York. Have to beat that off. They got New York all over. They don’t stop. This is a disgrace if that just came out. And I purposely tried to stay away from it because they all say it would be better if I’m not involved. I’ve fully declassified everything. Everything’s been declassified. They have so much information. They didn’t need any more than frankly, Mr. Horowitz, who was an Obama appointment. He wrote a report on Comey that was so bad, it was so bad, I’ve never seen anything like it. And they should have gone after him just on that. And McCabe too. He took $700,000 from Hillary Clinton. If that’s the case, and you have to understand, I’m hearing this for the first time, and I said, “It’s impossible.” So it’s okay for me to have to go through investigations during an election, but for them, we don’t want to upset the apple cart. The Republicans don't play the same game. We caught them, we caught them cold, and we have people that don’t know how to do anything about it. It’s horrible. If that’s the case, I have to check that. I find it hard to believe, because you know what? I went through two elections. You don’t think that affected ’18. Now, I wasn’t running in ’18, but the whole Russia witch hunt affected the ’18 outcome of the election. We lost some Congressional seats. People don’t say we picked up to two Senate seats, but we lost something in ’18. We lost something. We lost some seats that we probably could have held on to. We went through the same thing and it was all phony stuff. Nobody said, “Let’s hold it back til after the election.” But the Republicans don’t play the same game. They don’t play the same game. I’d be surprised and I’d be very disappointed. I’ll probably be disappointed because this stuff should have come out a year ago anyway. They had everything they needed a year ago. I thought it should have come out two years ago. I mean, frankly, as far as I was concerned. Look, if they hold it because of the election, I’ve gone through two elections now. They started investigating me before I even won the election. They started investigating me when I was coming down the escalator, the beautiful golden escalators with the First Lady. I was under investigation illegally by these thieves and Comey and crooks. We caught them in the act. They was spying on my campaign and then they went for a coup. Nobody said, “Well, gee, let’s hold off the investigation.” But with them, they do. The Republicans don’t play it the same way. It’s very disappointing. Let’s let everybody get elected to office and then let’s worry about it. First of all, if we don’t win this election, that whole thing is going to end, okay? And you just remember that. That’s another thing I’m fighting for, because these people have to be brought to justice. But they should have been brought to justice before the election. But if we don’t win this election, if we don’t win that whole thing is going to be dismissed. Just keep up the anger, keep up the genius, because they’re genius, they get it better than these guys that are looking at stuff. I’m telling you, they get it better. The American public gets this better than the so-called people that are looking. When I look at the Times and I look at the Washington Post, fake papers, both of them, and they get Pulitzer Prizes for the Russia investigation, but they were all wrong. There was no collusion. So they get Pulitzer Prizes. No, none of it. And the guys that did get it right, they don’t get Pulitzer Prizes. And you and I can name 10 of them. You’re one of them, but you don’t care about Pulitzer Prizes. But the ones that got it, they don’t get anything. But just, Rush, take a look at how wrong these people were. And they pretend they know me. Maggie Haberman, all of these people. I have nothing against them. But they don’t know me, they don’t know me. I haven’t seen her, I haven’t spoken to her in a year and a half. You take one picture with somebody, it ends up being like they’re the best friends for the rest of your life. Take a picture of the Oval Office with a photographer, with a reporter. And then they write as though you can’t live without them. I don’t even speak to these people. But look at the bad reporting that they’ve done. Look how wrong they were about everything. They got Pulitzer Prizes. The Pulitzer organization, frankly, is a disgrace. They gave Pulitzer Prizes to everybody that shouldn’t have gotten them. They were all wrong. And the people that should get the Pulitzer Prizes didn’t get them. You would think they’d want to take back the prizes on the basis that they made a mistake. I mean, you would think the committee would meet and say, “I’m sorry, but you got it wrong. We’re going to have to remand, we’re going to have to take back the prizes.” But Rush, think of it. They were totally wrong and they all got Pulitzer Prizes. And then they go into another story, it’s the same stuff. It’s so disgraceful when you look at what’s gone on. It’s so dishonest and they knew it. And Mueller was a fraud. The whole thing was a fraud. They were just thugs, thugs. And I’ll tell you something, a friend of mine said, a friend of mine who’s a very smart, very successful guy, lawyer, said, “You must be the most honest guy in the world. You’ve gone through three and a half years of investigations. They found nothing.” And they’ve gotten through my taxes. They’ve gone through everything. Hey, they spent $48 million, I think the last number I heard was, $48 million investigating me. They’ve gone through my taxes. They’ve gone through everything you can imagine at a level that nobody can even believe. Nobody’s ever had to put up and no other President should have to put up with this. But then I hear that they’re not going to do the thing before the election. Why? Because they’re afraid they’re going to influence the election. Because that’s the way that Republicans are. They play so nice all the time. It’s very disappointing. If Bill Barr actually made that statement, I would be very disappointed in him. I don’t know that he made that statement, but if he did do that, I’d be very disappointed. Well, they’ve had plenty of time to do it. They’ve been looking at it for two years. The facts are on the table. All you have to do is take a look at the Horowitz Report on Mueller. Even the New York Times on Mueller and especially what they wrote about this idiot Comey, the world’s worst FBI Director. But not only that, he’s a very dishonest guy. They’re totally aware. No, they’re totally aware. Even the other side’s aware of it. The other side laughs about it. They can’t believe they got away with it, you want to know the truth. They’re not stupid. They’re very smart. The other side laughs about it. It’s not like they believe the Russia thing. They don’t believe it. They laugh about it. Started this investigation, which was long before the race. After I won, they tried to take me out. Before I won, it was a fraud. It was the Russian witch hunt. Rush, you know this better than anybody, and Putin I guarantee you says this to everybody, nobody has been tougher on Russia than I have. I got NATO to pay $410 billion more to protect against Russia. I was the one that exposed Nord Stream, the pipeline going into Germany. I said, “Wait a minute, you’re paying Russia billions of dollars and we’re supposed to protect you from Russia. What kind of a deal is this?” I was the one that gave tank busters to Ukraine and Obama gave them pillows. Remember, the pillows, probably from the Pillow man on Fox. But Obama gave them pillows and sheets and I gave them tank busters. I gave them money. Obama didn’t. Nobody has been tougher on Russia than I have, nobody. She got a statement from Congress, a subpoena from Congress, everybody, “We want your emails,” all of Hillary Clinton’s emails, 33,000 of them. She deleted them, she acid washed them, and she broke her telephones with a hammer, broke them with a hammer. And by the way, speaking of that and speaking to Bill Barr, 31 people deleted their telephone messages from the Mueller Report. And they said they all made a mistake. Well, they made the same mistake. The chances are a billion to one that they would have made the same mistake. 31 phones were wiped clean on the Mueller Report. I want to see those phones. And how do you allow 31 phones? I think it was 19 people, 31 phones, you read about it just recently. They want the phones because they want the information on the phones because we caught them cheating. And they were all wiped, clean. Or most of them were wiped clean. We have a couple believe it or not. But they were wiped clean. They were deleted. Everything was deleted and cleansed, and you’re not allowed to do that. They broke the law. Nothing happens to these people. But they go after General Flynn, they go after Papadopoulos, they go after all these people, it is a disgrace. And one of the reasons I want to win so badly is we’ve got to finish this thing off. And I will be very disappointed if that Axios piece that you read to me is true. I’ll be very disappointed, because they’ve had plenty of time to get this done. Plenty of time. I don’t think the debates mean that much, and I’ll tell you why. I’ve done well with the base. I guess I had 15, I think I won every single poll. I won the poll on this one with him. But I had to be rude because he was lying. He’d get up and he’d just say a series of things, they were all lies. So I’d say, “False.” And they’d say I interrupted them. But if you look at the polls, most polls say I won it with him. But it was a very interesting thing. I’d rather let him speak because he’s gone, he’s mentally gone, and eventually he goes off track and he’ll start talking about the birds and the bees. But I couldn’t do that because he was saying so many false things. He’d say about the soldiers, he’d say about social security, which I’ll protect and he won’t protect, by the way. He’s not going to protect it. He doesn’t even know what it is. He’ll say about social security, and if I didn’t say, “Wrong,” et cetera, et cetera. But the one who protected him was Chris Wallace. And by the way, Fox is a whole different ball game. Fox is a much different thing than it was four years ago. Somebody said, ” What’s the biggest difference?” I said, “The biggest difference is Fox.” You take a look at Fox. Of course, we have our great ones, Sean and a number of them, but you watch this Fox, it’s a whole different ball game. And Paul Ryan is on the Board of Fox, so I’m sure that has something to do with it. But Fox is a whole different ball game. Somebody said to me, “What’s the biggest difference?” I said, “The biggest difference is Fox is no longer the same.” It’s a big difference. Well, that’s why I can talk to you and take literally two hours and your audience is bigger. But why I can talk to you, Rush, the great Rush, and you are the great one, and I’m honored to know you, but I can talk to you and I can spell out all of the dishonesty and everything else and millions of people are listening right now. I hope you have your all time biggest audience. No. But I can talk to you. Now, let’s say, I say, “No, I don’t want to do it,” or I want to be shy. I don’t want to talk, too many people, let’s not talk, no, you have such an incredible audience. So I can tell them about Fox being a big obstacle. It’s a problem. Fox is a problem. When Roger Ailes ran Fox, I mean, Roger had a very strong point of view. That’s totally gone. And I think it’s influenced by Paul Ryan. He’s on the Board. I can’t believe it. Here’s a guy who failed as Speaker. Did you know that Nancy Pelosi issues a subpoena like it’s cookies? Everything you do. “Did you make a phone call 12 years ago? Oh, I’ll issue subpoena.” You couldn’t get a subpoena out of Paul. We have great guys. I mean, we have Jim Jordan and these guys. They’re so fantastic. I deal with them. I deal with them. But they’ve gone a very different. It’s a much different group. They have guys on there that are so bad, they have people, I call them The Twins, there’s Chris Hahn and somebody else. They’re so bad. No, he works for Schumer. They’re Schumer people. How about when they hired Donna Brazile who gave Hillary the questions to the debate? Who got fired, by the way, Donna Brazil got fired from CNN and then Fox hires here. Got no credibility. It’s not like she’s great entertainment. It’s not even good entertainment. When they do that, when they put somebody like a Donna Brazile on, not that she’s effective, she’s not effective. I can think of people I’d much rather not have. It’s a shame. Fox should grab it and they should say, “Hey, we got the President and we’re going to defend out President,” but they’re not. They’re going the way of CNN and they’re going the way of MSDNC, and it’s a shame. I mean, it’s a shame. When I see it, I watch it, I look at the people they hire, I mean, I could tell you some of the anchors, they’re so bad. They’re so bad. And at the same time, the Fox and Friends is terrific in the morning. They’re good. I have to be. I have no choice, because otherwise you couldn’t survive it. Sean is great. And Tucker’s pretty good. Tucker has his moments, in all fairness. But Tucker is pretty good. And Laura has been great. We have a lot of good stuff. But Fox is 50% of what they were. I would say less than 50, but 50% of what they were. That’s still better than nothing. At some point, maybe they’ll go all the way, and that would be fine too. I’ll figure that out. I have figure it out. Because their ratings have died. I haven’t watched a basketball game, and I helped them get open, I haven’t watched a basketball game all year long. I tried to help the NFL. And then Roger, nice guy, Goodell in his basement wearing a very tight blue T-shirt, and he’s not meant for it, nor am I, nor are you, it’s just one of those things, at a certain age, you put on a tie, but what happens is he brought it up again. I said to him, “I thought I taught you a lesson two years ago about standing for the flag.” Their ratings went down to tubes, and now you look at with their hands in the air and they’re kneeling. I just don’t have the same interest, and neither do a lot of other people, Rush. The NBA has become so political that nobody cares about it anymore. I don’t even know who’s playing in the finals. I don’t know anybody that’s watching the NBA. LeBron has been a spokesman. I don’t know him. I never met him. All I know is when he endorsed Hillary, I said, “That’s the greatest endorsement I’ve ever seen,” because when he endorsed Hillary four years ago, she came up to his knee. I said, “That is not the best looking President I’ve ever seen.” I thought that was the greatest. It was standing. They were standing. No, she was up to about his knee. I mean, literally, I’ve never seen anything like it. And I said, “That’s not good.” But LeBron is a spokesman for the Democratic Party, and a very nasty spokesman. Because, again, I’ve done so much for the Black community and people don’t want to see that. And he’s a great basketball player, but people don’t want to see a guy that’s that way. They don’t want to see that. We have enough difficulty during the week, you don’t want to sit down and watch a basketball game and then watch somebody that hates your guts. And he’s a hater. So I look at it and I look at the NBA and I can’t watch it, and nobody’s watching it. And their ratings are down the tubes. And I’m telling you, I haven’t watched a basketball game in a long time. And I have no interest in doing it. And you know what? That’s a very sad commentary because I’d love to. But I just don’t have any interest in it anymore. “Pigs in a blanket, fry them like bacon.” The first time I ever heard of Black Lives Matter I said, “That’s such a terrible term because it’s such a racist term. It’s a term that sews division between Blacks and Whites and everybody else.” And it’s a very bad term for Blacks. But they were very angry. It’s a Marxist organization. It’s, “Pigs in a blanket, fry them like bacon.” Who are they referring to? New York City policemen. And I said, “Wow.” And if you would have told me that was going to go mainstream, but it never did go mainstream. It never did go mainstream. Absolute heroes. Yeah, well, it’s the Liberal Democrats, radical Liberal Democrats. Look, New York, Rudy was a great mayor. Rudy was our greatest mayor by far. He did things that were incredible and brought back New York. But it was easier in a way because the police had total respect. There was crime, but the police were the police. When they dumped water a year ago on the policemen head and he didn’t do anything about it, like turn around and slug the guy, when they did that, I don’t know if you remember, New York’s finest, New York’s finest, these are great police. I got endorsed by new York’s finest one month ago, and it’s the first time in the history of New York City that they’ve endorsed the President. Everybody. I don’t think anybody … In fact, I asked Biden at the debate and, of course, Chris Wallace cut it off, didn’t think it was appropriate. I said, “Name one police organization that endorsed you, Joe?” Then I said, “Say law and order, Joe, just law and order.” He wouldn’t do it. He wouldn’t do it. Then I think he said, “Law and order and safety.” I said, “No, no, just law and order. Law and order means safety. You don’t have to add the word safety.” That’s that little net. Let me tell you, if he got in, this country is going to hell. This country is going to go to hell like you’ve never seen. And you’ll end up in a depression the likes of which you haven’t seen since 1929. Your taxes are going up, your regulations. In the biggest tax cuts in history, bigger than Reagan’s tax cuts, I did something that was more important. I cut regulations that you couldn’t build a highway in less than 10 years. I mean, it would take you 10 years to get things done, or not done in one year. In other words, it may get disapproved because it’s not safe or environmentally good, or a lot of good reasons. But I cut regulations from 19 years to one year. I mean, you wouldn’t even believe it. People had to go through the same agency 14 different times. I have to be the one, yeah. Nobody else seems to be able to tell it properly. So I’d like to see it happen because it wasn’t … Look, a lot of people are being hurt because of China. It wasn’t these people’s fault. I would like to see it bigger, because maybe it helps or maybe it hurts negotiations. I would like to see a bigger package. I’d like to see money going to people. It was not their fault that China sent in the plague. It wasn’t their fault. And China’s going to pay a big price. China was going to catch us in 2019. If you look back 15, 20 years ago, everybody said by 2019 China will beat us. I was beating them so badly. We were doubling up. We were doing great until the plague came in, and we’re still beating them badly. We’ll still be. If you have a smart guy at top, you’ll always beat them. They’re paying us billions and billions of dollars in tariffs. People don’t realize when I made the deal. They’re paying billions of dollars. I gave a lot of it to farmers. Billions of dollars. Well, they devalue their currency and they make it impossible to compete because they devalue their currency. They’re currency manipulators and they devalue their currency, and therefore the dollar, they’re using dollars of a different value and it makes it very easy for them to compete, whereas we don’t do that, we don’t play games like that. Some people say we should. I don’t have a viewpoint, but they devalue their currency and they do all sorts of things. And what they do in the World Trade Organization, we just want a case, seven and a half billion dollars. First time-World Trade Organization. We just won a case, $7.5 billion. First time we’ve won a case in a long time. I said, “Look, I’m going to get out of the World Trade Organization if I have to, just like I got out of the World Health.” So we were paying $500 million a year in World Health. China’s paying $39 million a year in World Health. I say, “Why are they paying… they’re a bigger country. Why are they paying so much less?” I asked these little, stupid questions like that. Nobody could give me an answer. And yet they dominate the World Health. Okay? They dominate World Health. And World Health, when they did this horrible thing to us, World Health did nothing whatsoever to help us. We’re at $500 million a year. So I terminated the deal. Totally in the tank. They think about World Trade… By the way, same thing about World Trade. Do you know in World Trade China is considered a developing nation? If you’re a developing nation, you get tremendous advantages in the World Trade Organization. A hundred percent. And I ended that. I said, “I’m not going to accept that there a developing nation.” I wouldn’t say China’s in love with me, by the way. China is dying. Here’s what will happen. Just a couple of predictions. If I win, we’ll have a great deal with Iran within one month. They’re dying to have me lose, but if I win-No nuclear weapons. Don’t forget. Look at what’s happened to terrorism. Iran was a very wealthy nation, given $ 150 billion plus $1.8 billion in cash by Obama. A very wealthy nation, and now they’re a very poor nation. And the terrorist organizations, I knock on wood as I say it because it’s easier to start something, but they’re not fighting like they used to. You know why they have no money? Because Iran is bust. Iran is bust because of me, because of sanctions and other things. And the whole picture of terror… You don’t see the terror now. I hate to say it on an important show like this, but I’ll say it. You don’t see the terror the way you used to see the terror. And they know if they do anything against us, they’ll pay a thousand fold a problem. They’re going to have a thousand fold difference because they know now that we have things that we never had before. We have strength in weapons and things that we never had before. We never had it like we have it now. And Iran knows that. And they’ve been put on notice: if you fuck around with us, if you do something bad to us, we are going to do things to you that have never been done before. And they understand that. But here’s the thing. They’re no longer rich and they’re not giving out hundreds of millions of dollars to Hamas and all these other groups that caused all the problems. Now, nobody brings it out. When was the last time you saw an attack? Well Rush, this is the...I appreciate that very much. It's an honor. I know you do. And this is the most important election that we’ve ever had. And I used to say ’16, I don’t even get into that anymore. That’s over. This is the most important election that this country has ever had on so many different fronts. There’s never been anything like it. We will go the way of failed nations all over Latin America, South America. We will go the way of failure like nobody’s ever seen in a scale like nobody’s ever seen it. We’ve been taken advantage of by every nation in the world, including our friends. Our friends sometimes are worse than our enemies. We are… What I’ve done with NATO, we were taking care of virtually a hundred percent of the military needs of Europe, guarding them from Russia. At the same time, they would taking advantage of us on trade, and in many ways they were worse than China. Europe was worse to us on trade than China was. I mean, and I changed so many things, but then they say, “Oh, in Germany, they don’t like Trump as much as they liked Obama.” Well, of course they shouldn’t like me because Germany was taking advantage of us. Few countries took advantage of us. Nobody even knew about that pipeline until I brought it up. I said, “Why are you paying Russia billions of dollars when we’re protecting you? Tell me what kind of a deal is this? We’re protecting you, but you’re giving Russia every month billions of dollars.” She smiles because she’s a very smart one, she knows it. There’s no way she can answer the question. I say, “You don’t have to answer the question Angela.” I like on Angela. I get along with her, believe it or not, quite well, but she’s a player. And I said, “Angela, don’t answer the question because I don’t want to embarrass.” There’s no way she could answer the question because she gets away with it. That’s why. She’s a very smart cunning person. But I caught them. Hey Rush, I got them to pay $130 billion going to $410 billion more each year against Russia. Now I get along with Putin. I like Putin. Putin probably, possibly, likes me, but I guarantee you one thing, he would have much rather seen crooked Hillary and I guarantee he’d rather see Biden because Biden is slow. Biden is not equipped to be president. The sharpest people. They’re 85, they’re 80. It’s not an age… now they’re all saying, Oh, it’s 78. It’s not because he’s 78. There’s something wrong with him. Okay? And we can be nice about it-There’s something wrong with him, and nobody wants to say it. Nobody wants to say it, but he can’t… His thoughts are bad… Here’s a guy, you talk about access to the press. I’ve never seen this before, and I’ve watched a lot and I don’t know how it gets away. You saw that NBC joke the other night where there’s… It’s like a child. Like you’re asking a child questions. They don’t talk to me that way. When you look at the questions that he gets, and then he reads the answers off a computer. Now that means that these supposedly legitimate, but they’re not legitimate… You know that better than I do… These news organizations are giving him questions, they’re putting them in a computer, he’s reading the answers off a computer. I never heard of that before. I’ve never done that. Can you imagine? Give me the questions and I’m going to give you an answer off a computer. He’s reading the answers off a computer a lot of times. And if he doesn’t do that, he’s all mixed up and befuddled. And Chris Wallace saved him three times the other night. I mean, he was getting ready to crack, and Chris Wallace… Who was terrible by the way, who I think really embarrassed himself and Fox the other night. But Chris Wallace saved him. But can you imagine, you’re getting the answers to questions and you’re getting the questions themselves and you’re reading the answers-One thing I’ll say, Hillary was a much smarter. Hillary is a much smarter person. I mean, look, Hillary was smart. Yeah, I understand. Hillary didn’t need to have answers read. She could answer a question. Joe can not answer a question. Joe, they ask him a question, a very simple question, and he’s reading it off a computer. He’s saying, “Move the computer. Move it, bring it closer, bring it…” He couldn’t see it. “Bring it closer.” On a question that that anybody could answer. I mean, it’s a very simple question. We can’t have this. We could be nice, and maybe I’ll lose because they’ll say I’m not a nice person. I think I am a nice person. I help people. I like to help people, but we can’t have this as our president. We really can’t, Rush. You’re right. We would be, but still that’s a much different man talking there than you see now. Much different man. Well, look, absentee ballots where you send in via ballot… I have an absentee ballot in Florida. You send in, and you have to request it, and they send it. So it’s not easy, but it’s okay. Some people just can’t do it, but they send it. That’s called absentee. I call it a solicited ballot. I like that term better. You solicit, and they send it, and you’d fix it and you’d send it back in. Okay. That’s one thing. But they’re sending out millions and millions of ballots. Are they sending them to all Democrats? Who are they sending them to? Where are they going? Et cetera, et cetera. This is going to be the second biggest political scandal in history. The first biggest is the Russian crap that we’ve been going through for three and a half years. That’s the biggest. To me, that’s the biggest political scandal in history-What we’ve been going through and now they delay it? You’re telling me they delay it? That’s going to be my first phone call, by the way. I think it’s just a disgrace, if that’s the case. It’s a disgrace. And I’ll say it to anybody who wants to say it. That’s a disgrace. But the biggest scandal of all time is that. This will be the second biggest scandal. Every day I’m seeing accounts of ballots that are thrown away. You saw the military ballots that with thrown away with my name on it the other day? Every day, you see scandal about these millions of ballots that’s being sent out. It’s the single biggest risk in this election. We have many lawyers and we’ve actually been winning many cases. How about where they have the ballots counted and the ballots have to be in by November 3rd election day, but they don’t have to be counted for two weeks later. Well, that means you’re never going to know who won the election. It’s going to be two weeks later? I want to see you on November 3rd, who won the election. So do you. You want to turn on your television, like we have for the last 50 years and find out who won the election, right? You don’t want to say, “Oh, gee, they have two weeks to count their ballots.” And then what happens is all sorts of ballots starts showing up miraculously. We’re watching it very closely and we’re winning a lot of cases, Rush. You don’t see it too much. We just won a big case in North Carolina. We just won a big case in Pennsylvania, I think we’re going to win. We’re winning a lot of cases… Rhode Island, won a big case… where the ballots have to be done in a certain way, but the best way is to get up… Now, I tell you what. Our people, your people, my people, Republican people, they get out… And they’re all my people as far as… Everyone’s my people, but Republicans tend to get out and vote. And that’s what they should do. Early voting, but at a machine. Early voting or voting on November 3rd. And when you see the love that’s going to be expressed the day those polls open, the day those machines open wait till you see. But the Democrats are sending an 80% of theirs by ballot. Now, one thing we’ve noticed from what I hear and from what I’m reading, is a lot of the ballots, all they’re doing is taking from people that would have voted in the first place. So not a lot of new voters. We have many more registered voters than we’ve… We’ve picked up a lot of voters, the Republicans. I think you’re going to see a very, very big explosion when those polls open up, Rush. But a large percentage, like 80% of the Republicans want to vote. They want to actually go to a poll and vote. Whereas it’s almost the opposite, for whatever reason, with the Democrats. I think you’re going to see a very big explosion of voting. Right, right. And then they do the harvesting thing, which is terrible, which is illegal in many places, even with the laws that are being passed, where they go around and this start picking up everybody’s votes. We have a big enthusiasm gap. Our gap is so much more enthusiastic, like 30, 35 points. There’s never been a gap of enthusiasm between, let’s say me and him, that there is. Look at a boat shows. I mean, thousands of boats in the ocean, in the lakes-By a lot. They say, ""Who is your neighbor going to vote for?"" They know their neighbors. No, because people don’t want to get involved. I mean, even the signs, we have signs all over the place. We have signs in States, but they steal the signs. People steal the signs and they’re stealing… It’s a well-known thing. They’re stealing the signs. Our enthusiasm is far greater than it was four years ago, far greater because they love the job we’re doing. And they know this pandemic was a horrible thing that happened to us. It should have never been allowed to happen by China. China is going to pay a big price, and it’s one of those things, but it happened and we’ve done a great job. Why don’t we got no credit? I’ll tell you what, if this turns out to be right, that this medicine is going to make people better. That’s a game changer like nobody’s ever seen before, and it’s going to happen. It’s going to happen, Rush. That’s true, but it’s an honor. It’s an honor to be with you for two hours. You have no idea. It’s a great honor. It is largely. And what I say oftentimes when people say that, “I have no choice, I have to do it.” I have no choice. And that’s what I’m doing. 
















"
"82","10-10-20","Thank you. Well, thank you very much and keep that enthusiasm going, get out and vote. We got to vote. We got to vote these people into oblivion, vote them into oblivion. Got to get rid of them so bad for our country. First of all, I’m feeling great. I don’t know about you. How’s everyone feeling? Good? And I’m honored to welcome, we call this a peaceful protest to the White House in support of the incredible men and women of law enforcement and all of the people that work so well with us. I have to tell you our black community, our Hispanic community, thank you very much. Thank you. But before going any further, I want to thank all of you for your prayers. I know you’ve been praying and I was in that hospital. I was watching down over so many people and I went out to say hello to those people. And I took a little heat for it, but I’d do it again. And let me tell you, I’d do it again. On behalf of myself and the First Lady, this has been really an incredible outpouring and we’re starting very, very big with our rallies and with our everything, because we cannot allow our country to become a socialist nation. We cannot let that happen. And that’s what would happen or worse, by the way or worse. I want you to know our nation’s going to defeat this terrible China virus, as we call it and we’re producing powerful therapies and drugs and we’re healing the sick and we’re going to recover. And the vaccine is coming out very, very quickly in record time. As you know, it’s coming out very, very soon. We have great, great companies doing it and there’ll be distributing it. And we will through our military very, very rapidly, through the power of the American spirit, I think more than anything else, science medicine will eradicate the China virus once and for all. We’ll get rid of it all over the world. You see big flare ups in Europe, big flare ups in Canada, very big flare up in Canada, you saw that today. A lot of flare ups, but it’s going to disappear. It is disappearing and with vaccines are going to help and the therapeutics are going to help a lot. I just want to thank everyone this afternoon. What beautiful colors. Where did you get that color Candace? Where did that come from? What a beautiful color. I want to get one of them. I want to put one of them on instead of a white shirt. I want to thank you though, seriously. Every day, more black and Latino Americans are leaving behind left wing politicians and their failed ideology. It’s what they are. They failed for many years and many, many decades. Democrats have run nearly every inner city in America and I mean, for 100 years and their policies have delivered nothing but calamity, poverty and trouble. Sleepy Joe Biden has betrayed black and Latino Americans. If you think he can run this country, you’re wrong. For half a century, shipping your jobs to China, that’s what they’ve been doing. We’re bringing the jobs back. We’ve been bringing them back. We’ve been charging China a lot of money too, with the tariffs, a lot of money, billions and billions of dollars. Opening your borders to mass illegal immigration. The wall is now 380 miles long. It’ll soon be finished. Trapping us in endless foreign wars, these ridiculous foreign wars that lasts for 19 years, our people are coming back home you know that. And selling you out to the rich global as Wall Street donors, they have the Wall Street donors. They want the Wall Street donors. Someday somebody is going to have to write a little story about that. Black and Latino Americans are rejecting the radical socialists left and they’re embracing our pro jobs, pro worker, pro-police. We want law and order. We have to have law and order and pro-American agenda. I want to thank the Blexit Foundation for organizing this event. Thank you very much. Thank you. And especially your two founders, two friends of mine, great people, Candace Owens and former Tucson police officer, Brandon Tatum. Thank you, both. Great job. What a great job. Two really brilliant, smart young people. Great. And thank you very much for being here. We really appreciate it. So you’ve just marched to the White House because you understand to protect the lives of black Americans and all Americans, you have to have your police support you. You have to have that. If the left gains power, they’ll launch a nationwide crusade against law enforcement, and they’ve already done that. And you see them. They’re doing that at a level that nobody’s ever seen before. The other day in the debate Biden couldn’t even use the words law enforcement. I said, “Say law enforcement. Say law enforcement,” and he was bailed out by the anchor. Then I said, very simply I said, “Name one law enforcement group that’s supporting you,” he couldn’t do it, but he was bailed out by the anchor. Second time bailed. He got bailed out by that anchor a lot. Taking their funds away, their firearms, their fundamental authorities, taking everything away, including your freedom. Joe Biden even said, “When you call 911, a therapist should answer the call.” That doesn’t work. That doesn’t work. But this is the people telling him what, because he doesn’t say, he’s told what to say. You saw what they introduced today. They’ve gone through a period of years. No fracking, no fracking, no fracking. All of a sudden gets a nomination, he says, “There’s got to be fracking.” For Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, Texas, North Dakota, all of you, there will be if it happens, all of those jobs are gone. Your energy jobs are gone if they get in. Just remember I said it. Just to remember. I don’t think so either. And I have to say ,there’s been more enthusiasm. We have had more enthusiasm right now, right now this year than we had four years ago by a factor of three times. And we had a lot and they had none. They have no enthusiasm. They have no enthusiasm. In fact, the gap is so incredible and a poll just came out, I think it said 56% of the people prefer their position now in the midst of a pandemic than they did four years ago. Think of what that means. 56. And it’s a Gallup poll and it’s the highest poll ever recorded. 56%. Now tell me about that. No, we had it going and we really had it going and then the plague came in from China but we’re getting rid of that and we’re rebuilding it and it’s going to be better than it was even before. But the homes and churches and businesses of black and Hispanic Americans have been looted, you know that. They’ve been vandalized and burned by left wing fanatics, total bad people. They know what they’re doing, yet Biden likes to call them peaceful protesters. You see people, you see anchors from a couple of the very bad, very corrupt networks standing and behind them, the cities are burning and they’re saying, “This is a peaceful protest,” and you look, and everything’s on fire. I want to thank our law enforcement and I want to thank everybody in the community, in the community drives that are working with law enforcement. I want to thank them. I think we have the support of every law enforcement group in this country practically. I don’t know of any that I don’t. Maybe there must be some, there must be one. They’ll find one tonight. They’ll say, “No, he misrepresented.” But we have a level of support the likes of which nobody’s I don’t think ever seen before. I don’t think so. And you’re going to see that. Do you see how many crooked ballots are being found and turned back in and fraudulent? Just what I said. Then they’ll say, “He doesn’t believe in freedom.” I totally believe in freedom. That’s called freedom. What we’re doing is freedom. Tremendous problems with the ballots. 50,000 in Ohio, 25,000… You have to see it. I mean, every day there’s a story about ballots. Some thrown out that happen to have the name Trump, military ballots were thrown out with the name Trump on them. But I think we’re going to swamp them by so much. Hopefully, it’s not going to matter. And we have law enforcement watching. We have law enforcement watching all those ballots, they’re being found for a reason. Left wing politicians like Kamala Harris who really did not do very well the other night. By the way, did our Vice-President do a good job, Candace? That was easy for him. No, he did a great job because we’re in the side of right. We really are. We’re on the side of right. And by the way we are, and it’s true and I say it and I say it all the time now, more and more, we are draining the swamp like nobody in history has ever drained the swamp. Nobody in history has ever drained. We’re here today to deliver a united message to police officers all across our great land that are American. And I mean every American, every race and color, we love you. Every race, color, creed, we support you. We honor you. It’s a dangerous profession. They’ve been doing an incredible job and I just want to thank them on behalf of everybody here today, because that’s why we’re safe. In contrast, the Democrat’s socialist program and platform, and it really is more than socialist. It’s not just socialist, it’s beyond socialism. He says, “Communist.” Yeah, that’s about right. But I recently announced my plan to deliver more opportunities, security, fairness, and prosperity to the black community, to the Hispanic community. And you know what it is. I don’t have to go over it, but it’s the Platinum Plan. And it’s going to bring back new jobs, like at a level that you’ve never seen before. And we’ve done a lot. We’ve done a lot, but increase capital. It’s going to increase money coming into the black community, to the Hispanic community where it’s been very much shut out, in advance, very much home ownership and wealth building. And it’s already taking place and it’s taking place at a level, and had we not been hit by the pandemic, you would have seen numbers like you’ve never seen before, but those numbers are already rebuilding again. We’re going to build up a peaceful and safer neighborhood program like you haven’t seen with the highest standards of policing, we’ll create a healthcare system that delivers better care at a lower cost. Obamacare is a disaster. We want to terminate it. We want to get great healthcare. And that’s what we’re doing. Great healthcare. And we’ll always take care of pre-existing conditions, always. And I think we’re at a point where we’re getting and right now if you look at what we’ve done in healthcare, people don’t talk about it. We’ve done an incredible job. Less expensive healthcare… Much better healthcare at a much less expensive price. You can’t do better than that. And it’s happening and it’s happening fast. Another thing is school choice. You have to have school choice. Charter schools, school choice. So I make this statement every once in a while and people think it’s a little bit in the bull side but we’ve achieved a historic reduction of violent crime, we signed a landmark criminal justice reform bill that nobody thought was possible to even think about. I did that. I did that. I got that done. And I worked with a lot of people, but we got it done. The Obama administration couldn’t get it done. Biden couldn’t even think about it. He doesn’t even know what it is. We have prison reform. We achieved the lowest black and Hispanic unemployment rate in the history of our country. The black youth unemployment rate reached the lowest ever again in the history of our country. And last year, black and Hispanic American poverty reached the lowest ever in the history of our country. It’s all building back up so quickly. And if you look at what we’ve done with criminal justice reform, if you look at what we’ve done with historically black colleges and universities, where we funded them, they couldn’t get funded. Nobody was funding that for years and years and decades, nobody was funding them. And if you look at what we’ve done with Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, Opportunity Zones and the jobs created. And I’ve said it very strongly and perhaps, I don’t know, criminal justice reform, people say, maybe that’s the best of all but the fact is they’re all great. Every one of them is great. And I say, the fact is that I’ve done more for the black community than any president since Abraham Lincoln. I say it. Nobody can dispute it. Nobody can dispute it, it’s true. Nobody can dispute it. So we are now beginning the fastest economic recovery in history. We created a record 11.4 million jobs just in the last four months. That’s the fastest ever. The US has seen the smallest economic contraction of any major nation anywhere in the world. So we’ve seen the smallest going down. If you look at it, that’s an incredible statement. Our opponents will crush the comeback with unscientific lockdowns. They want to lock everything down. Here we go again. They want to lock it down. We’re not going to let it happened. We’re not going to let it happen. So important you get out and vote. You got to get out and vote. We got a great poll in Florida. Got a great poll in North Carolina. Got a great poll in Arizona. Got a great poll in Nevada, actually. Just got a great poll in Nevada. I think we’re doing really well. I mean, this is in addition to states that we’re going to win. Georgia is looking fantastic. Texas is looking for fantastic. Well, think about Texas, they have no oil, they don’t want oil. They don’t want guns. They don’t want religion. I don’t think you’re going to win Texas very well. Now, we’ve got a great poll in Texas. We’re getting great polls all over the place and they understand it. It’s driving them crazy. And you know why though? And Candace, it is. It’s because of the spirit. There’s a spirit the likes of which this country hasn’t seen in a very, very long time. So I just want to thank you all for being on the White House lawn and this beautiful great lawn and I’m very proud of this country. I’m very, very proud. I want to thank all of the doctors and labs and scientists and all of the people that are working so hard because we’re way ahead of everybody. But I just want to thank most particularly you because you people come out and you come out and you cheer and you love your country and you get it. You’re way, way ahead, of many, many people in this country, but the country is getting it. The country is seeing something now. Thank you. I love you too. The people of our country and the whole world is watching, are seeing things now that they haven’t seen in this country for decades. They’re seeing a spirit and a resilience like they haven’t seen. I just want to thank you and get out and vote. We got to make this bigger than even four years ago. It’s more important. This is the most important election we’ve ever had. This is more important than even four years ago. I used to say the most important and it was true at the time. This is the single most important election in the history of our country. Get out and vote. And I love you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you, Candace. Thank you. Thank you.
















"
"83","10-12-20","Hello everybody. Hello Orlando. Hello Sanford. It’s great to be with you. Thank you. It’s great to be back. That’s a lot of people. Our competitor sleepy Joe, he had a rally today and practically nobody showed up. I don’t know what’s going on. Sleepy Joe. But it’s great to be back in my home state, Florida to make my official return to the campaign trail. I am so energized by your prayers and humbled by your support. We’ve had such incredible support and here we are. Here we are. But we’re going to finish. We’re going to make this country greater than ever before. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. We’ve made tremendous progress. If you look at what we’re doing with therapeutics and frankly cures, we’ve made tremendous progress. And I said to my people, we are going to take whatever the hell they gave me and we’re going to distribute it around to hospitals and everyone’s going to have the same damn thing. We’ve all endured a lot together. And we are doing better by far than we ever did in 2016. The enthusiasm’s greater. The spirit is greater. We’re going to have, if it’s possible, an even greater and more important victory than we had just four years ago. And nobody ever said this fight was not going to be a hard one, but we will make it like you’ve never seen before. We are more successful now than we’ve ever been before. Our military is rebuilt. Take a look at what’s going on with our economy. I hate to say to the fake news, we’re about to hit another stock market record, 401Ks. Sleepy Joe Biden. Not a nice guy, by the way. I have to be honest. He’s not a nice guy. People say, “Oh, he’s such a nice guy.” He had a very bad day today. He had a very bad day. You saw what happened. If I ever had a day like he had today, they’d say it’s over. It’s over. No Biden had a bad day. He forgot Mitt Romney’s name. He didn’t know what state he was in. And he said today he’s a proud Democrat running for the US Senate. No you can’t. Can’t do it. It’s the second time. Can you imagine if I did that? “It’s great to be with you. It’s great to be a wonderful developer from New York.” They’d say he’s out of here. Get him out. No, Biden had a bad day. He’s got a lot of bad days coming. Look, look, we can’t play games. The one thing I know for sure, President Xi of China did us no favor. President Putin of Russia, you’re looking around. Kim Jong-un, whatever happened to the war we were supposed to be in with Kim Jong-un. Kim Jong-un, they’re 100% sharp. We have somebody running who’s not 100%. He’s not 80%. He’s not 60%. We can’t have this as a country. We can’t have it. Joe Biden is also owned by the radical globalists, the wealthy donors, the big money special interests who shipped away your jobs, shut down your factories, threw open your borders and ravaged our cities while sacrificing American blood and treasure in this ridiculous, endless wars. Set of endless wars that we’ve been in for a long time. 19 years, they’re all coming back home. You know that, right? They’re all coming back home. Our great warriors, our great soldiers. The corrupt political class is desperate to regain their power by any means necessary. We’re the one standing in their way. We’re the one standing up for the American worker, the American family, and for the American dream. And that’s what we’re doing on this beautiful evening. This beautiful evening in Florida. Oh do I like Florida. Did we win Florida last time? Was that beautiful? Everything I hear, we’re winning by a lot. Then you turn on the fake news. They say, “The polls are tied in Florida.” I don’t get it. I don’t. We heard the same thing last year. Remember? Four years ago, we heard the same thing. ” We’re going to lose Florida,” they said four years ago, “by five points.” They called that thing so early in the evening and we won by a lot. And we’re winning by a lot more now than we were four years ago. 22 days from now, we’re going to win this state. We’re going to win four more years in the White House. We’re going to make our country greater than it has ever been before. Thank you, man. Thank you. This is the most important election in the history of our country. And I used to say it in 2016. I’m sorry, at the time I thought it was. These people are crazy. We have to win. Most important we’ve ever had. Biden has made a corrupt bargain exchange for his party’s nomination. He’s handed control to the socialists, the Marxists and the left-wing extremists. And you know that. And he’s got no strength left. He’s got no power left. He’s got nothing going. If he wins, the radical left will be running the country and they’re addicted to power and God help us if they ever got it, because we would never have the same country again. And you couldn’t make a comeback. You don’t make comebacks from where they’d take us. If I do not sound like a typical Washington politician, it’s because frankly, I’m not a politician. I’m embarrassed by the throne. And if I don’t always play by the rules of Washington establishment, it’s because I was elected to fight for you and I fight harder than anybody has ever fought for you. And I had a very nice life before this, I will tell you. And a lot easier. But I love this, that I would have never, ever change because we are doing more for this country than any administration has ever done despite the witch hunts and the phony stuff that we caught them on now. We caught them cold and we’ll see what happens with that. Just watch, stay tuned. Right now I’m fighting to make sure we eradicate the virus, rebuild the economy and save our country from the radical left. We’re hitting record stock market numbers, record 401Ks, record stocks, record job numbers. Don’t blow it. Don’t blow it. Sleepy Joe wants to quadruple your taxes. He wants to quadruple. How about where he gets caught again, he said, “Oh no, we’re not going to give a tax increase, but we’re going to terminate all of the Trump tax cuts.” Well, that’s $2,000 plus child tax credits, plus all of the other things, you’re talking about $6,000, $7,000, $8,000 a year. I don’t think Florida is going to be paying that per family. And if you add energy into that, we have energy at all time low. We’re energy independent. Nobody ever thought that was going to happen. And when you are paying less than $2 at the pump like you are, nobody ever thought you’d see those days again. And those days are here for a long time if we’re smart. We’ve been beating China. We’ve been beating everybody. Until the plague came in, we were teaching China like they’ve never been taught before and they know it. And they’ve told me that and they never thought it could happen. And we’re very soon going to be doing it again. We achieved all of this despite the fact that we caught them cold. They were spying on our campaign. It’s our campaign. It’s our campaign, not my campaign. There was spying on our campaign and illegally trying to take down a very, very straightforward and legally sworn in administration. We were sworn in. They tried before the fact, they tried after the fact. We were an admin… And then they say, “We want to know if you will agree with a friendly transfer of power.” For four years, they’ve been trying to get us out of office. Four years they’ve been trying to get us out, but we’ll take care of it all after the election. We caught them cold. We caught them cold. Bad people, crooked Hillary. And by the way, Obama and Biden knew everything that was happening, okay? Just in case you had any question. We’ll take care of it after the election. Joe Biden and the Democrat socialists, but that gives you another reason to go out and vote. We got to get in. Because we don’t, they’ll just sweep it under the rug. Joe Biden and the Democrat socialists will kill your jobs, dismantle your police departments, dissolve your borders. You know that? Release criminal aliens, confiscate your guns. No more Second Amendment, get used to it. Destroy your suburbs and drive God from the public square. That’s what’s going to happen. You saw in the pledge of allegiance during the Democrat National Convention. They took the word God out twice. They said, “Oh, we made a mistake. Excuse me.” And then it happened a second time. We said, “Well, I guess that wasn’t a mistake, right?” Biden even refuses to answer questions on the packing of the Supreme Court. Nobody even thought of that for many, many, many decades. And that’s what they want to do. They can’t get there legitimately. So they’re said, “That’s all right. We’ll just pack the court. We’ll put a lot of super lefties on the court and we’ll have a whole different country.” Nope. Not going to happen that way. We’re not going to let it happen. You got to get out and vote. A lot of people said that I was elected because of the Supreme Court, because I said I’m going to put great conservative, constitutionalists, great judges on the Supreme Court. I don’t know if it’s true. But if it is true, it’s more true now than it was four years ago. And you got to get out and vote because they’re going to destroy our country and they’re going to destroy our US Supreme Court, and we can’t let that happen. But who would have thought? We’re on number three. Other presidents have never had any. They’ve never had any. We’re at three already, three and a half years. And I will say this, I will say this. It’s driving them crazy. It’s driving them crazy. And Amy is fantastic. A great intellect, a great scholar. I think she’s going to be a fantastic US Supreme Court Justice. As America saw earlier today in Amy’s opening statement in the Senate, Judge Barrett, a brilliant scholar who will defend our laws, our rights, our freedom, and our constitution like very few people would have the capability of doing. The radical left is hell bent on destroying everything we love and cherish. They’re enraged and unhinged out of vengeance and nobody can believe what they’re doing and where they’re going, but we understand it. We understand their canceled culture. We’re not letting them cancel culture us at all. We’re proud of our country and we’re proud of our heritage. They want to punish the middle-class, expunge every last trace of traditional values and replace the American dream with a socialist nightmare, and that’s what it is. They want to turn America into communist Cuba or socialist Venezuela, and ruin the lives of Hispanic Americans and all Americans. And I want to thank the Hispanic Americans down in Florida. You have been so incredible to Trump. Biden’s agenda would be a catastrophe for Florida seniors. And by the way, Biden was a big lover of Castro. You do know that, right? And you know the deal that I broke, you saw that? Right as I came into office, Obama gave the whole planet away to Castro. And I said, “No, thank you. We’re not doing that.” That’s why we just got the Bay of Pigs award from the Cuban Americans, thank you very much. And a lot of them are here. Thank you all very much. Bay of Pigs. For years, Biden tried to cut Social Security and Medicare. You know all about that. Now Biden is pledging mass amnesty and federal healthcare for illegal aliens. Now, we all have a heart and we all want to take care of people. But what you’re doing is you’re telling millions of people to pour up into our country. We’re going to give you education. We’re going to give you healthcare. We’re going to give you everything. We can’t do it. We can’t afford it. We can’t take care of our own people. We have to take care of our people first. And if they let that happen, you would be decimating Medicare and destroying your Social Security. While I’m president, no one will touch your Medicare. No one will touch or hurt in any way, shape or form your Social Security. With your vote I will finish building the strongest economy the world has ever seen and we were there. Last year was the greatest year in the history of the State of Florida. And I have to say, it was practically that way for almost every state in the union. But it was Florida’s best year. The year coming is going to be, and you’re going to see a great third quarter set of numbers coming out very soon just before the election. So I’m putting myself on the spot. The third quarter numbers are going to be record setting phenomenal numbers. Next year is going to be the best year we’ve ever had economically. But as I’ve done from the beginning, I will keep every promise and I will always put America first. You haven’t heard that, right? You haven’t heard that from other people. Under my leadership, we’re delivering a safe vaccine and a rapid recovery like nobody could even believe. And if you look at our upward path, no country in the world has recovered the way we’ve recovered economically or otherwise, not even close. And if you vote for me, prosperity will surge. Normal life, that’s all we want. We want a normal life. We’ll fully resume. And the Florida tourism and hospitality industries that I know so well, will reach historic new highs. Highs like they’ve never reached before. Biden would terminate our recovery. Delay the vaccine, prolong the pandemic and annihilate Florida’s economy with a draconian unscientific lockdown. That’s what he wants to do, lock it down. Lock it down, everybody. And you know what? If you don’t feel good about going out, stay, relax, stay. You know the risk groups, you know the older people. See, fortunately, I’m not an old person. I’m very young and I’m in such perfect shape. I’m in such great shape. I said that the other day. I said, “Well, I’m very young, and I’m in great shape, perfect shape.” And they said, “Donald Trump misrepresented today, again. He said he was in great shape, that he’s very young.” These people are the sickest of them all. But the World Health Organization, did you see what happened? They just came out a little while ago, and they admitted the Donald Trump was right. The lockdowns are doing tremendous damage to these Democrat-run states, where they’re locked out, sealed up. Suicide rates, drug rates, alcoholism, deaths by so many different forms. You can’t do that. And I want to just congratulate the governor and everybody in Florida. You’re open and open for business and doing great. And we got to remember, I said it right at the beginning, the cure cannot be worse than the problem itself. The cure can not be worse, but if you don’t feel good about it, if you want to stay, stay, relax, stay. But if you want to get out there, get out. One thing with me, the nice part, I went through it. Now they say I’m immune. I feel so powerful. I will walk into that audience. I’ll walk in there, I’ll kiss everyone in that audience. I’ll kiss the guys and the beautiful women, and everybody. I’ll just give you a big, fat kiss. No, but there is something nice. I don’t have to be locked up in my basement, and I wouldn’t allow that to happen anyway. I wouldn’t allow it to happen. When you’re the president, you can’t lock yourself in a basement and say, “I’m not going to bother with the world.” You got to get out, and it’s risky. It’s risky, but you got to get out. But it does give you a good feeling when you can beat something, and now they say you’re immune. I don’t know for how long. Some people say for life. Some people say for four months. I mean, every time I think about it, every time I hear them, it gets shorter and shorter and shorter, because they want it to be as bad as possible. But it is a great feeling. I want to thank, by the way, Walter Reed Medical Hospital, Johns Hopkins. These guys are incredible. We’re 90% better now than we were six, seven months ago, in terms of a cure for people that get really sick, 90%. It’s incredible what’s happened. And with children is 99.9%, you’re going to be okay. You’re going to be okay. 99. 9. They have a little better immune systems, we just learned that, better than you have, better than we all have. But we love our children, but we have to get our schools open. We have to get up businesses going back. We have to get our country rolling, and it is rolling. You’re going to see that when the numbers come out. The Biden virus plan … and you got to remember, he took H1N1, which he always calls in N1H1. He gets it mixed up. I said, “No, Joe. H comes first.” But it’s called the swine flu. Right? And his own person, his chief of staff, said that it was a disaster the way they ran it. A much less lethal problem, but a disaster, the way they ran it, a total catastrophe. It was so bad. It was so bad. And then he says, “I’m going to tell him what to do. But when I locked down China, he thought it was a terrible thing. He called me xenophobic when I locked down China, which was in January, months earlier than what he said. Then ultimately, admitted I’m right, but then he said, “Oh, he should have acted faster.” Well, this was months later that he says I should have acted … Nobody acted fast like I did. I also shut down, locked down Europe, if you remember. And the bottom line is we saved millions of lives. When this first came out, if we didn’t do a good job, they predicted 2.2 million people would die. We’re 210,000. We shouldn’t be at one. It’s China’s fault. They allowed this to happen. They allowed it to escape China. But 2.2 million people would have died. Just remember that, just to remember that, a fact they don’t like talking about. I have such respect for the people of this country, the way they’ve handled it. It’s been an incredible love fest together. That’s really what it’s been. And sympathies from all of us, to those people who, whose family members have died, whose friends … I’ve lost friends. I’ve lost friends. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. You’re going to love me even more. You’re going to love me even more, because we’re years ahead on vaccines, and they’re going to be distributed very shortly. I mean, frankly, it’s a big political deal going on, where they don’t want it to be before the election. Don’t let it be. But we have great vaccines coming. Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, Pfizer. I mean, we have great, great things happening with the vaccines. I think even greater with the cures and with the therapeutics. And maybe it’s why I’m here with you. Maybe it’s not, I’m not sure. I know one thing, I was very happy to take it, that I can tell you. But through Operation Warp Speed, we’re on track to have 100 million vaccine doses before the end of this year, and they’ll be delivered by the military, and they’re all set to go. They’re waiting for final approval. And that vaccine will end the pandemic, but we’re also launching a historic effort to bring your medical supply chains back home. In 1996, Joe Biden voted to obliterate Puerto Rico’s thriving pharmaceutical industry. Remember, they used to have a great pharmaceutical industry. He cut it out. And when he cut it out, he sent Puerto Rico into a nosedive like nobody’s ever seen before. So we’re bringing it all back, and we’re bringing it back to Florida too. We’re bringing it all the way back, taking our jobs away from China. We’re bringing it back from China. I’ll reverse. Biden’s catastrophic decision. We’ll bring it all back. The drug industry’s coming back into Puerto Rico, coming back into, by the way, Pennsylvania, coming back into North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, coming back into Michigan, coming back into Ohio. We’re bringing it all back. Last month, I also announced an additional $13 billion in disaster relief for Puerto Rico and for Florida. Have I taken care of Florida. Have I taken care of Florida. My administration’s allocated over $60 billion. And if you look at Florida, where your great governors, your last two governors have been great, your two senators, great. They’re always calling, asking for money, but I guess that’s what they’re supposed to be doing. And I’m always giving it when it comes to Florida. The panhandle got hit really hard over the last two years. We took care of the panhandle. So days ago, I was honored to receive the endorsement of the governor of Puerto Rico. Can you believe that? Right? Wanda Vázquez Garced. And she was so nice. They were also joined by several great Puerto Rican community leaders, [ Jay Rosario 00:00:25:00], [Gabe Ruiz 00:08:02], [Daisy Lopezid 00:25:05], Myra Guzman-Kaslow and candidate for Congress. Dr. Leo Valentina. Please, where are you? Where are you? I’m not going to say the best, but I’m just about the best thing that ever happened to Puerto Rico. You better vote for me, Puerto Rico. You better vote. But I’ll always be fighting for Puerto Rico. It’s very unfair the way they were treated by Democrats. And while Biden will surrender your jobs to China, your country and your fellow politicians, and I have a lot of great ones right here, including your governor. Wow. We will never allow ourselves to even think about surrendering to the left wing mob. They’re on the run. They’re on the run. Better not have them have a little bit of a victory, because if they have even a little victory, it’s not going to be good. I’m bringing our jobs back home and putting violent criminals behind bars. I’m working with your political leaders. We’ve also directed the FBI to immediately investigate the destruction of the Teddy Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln statues in Portland and to prosecute the offenders to the fullest extent of federal law. Biden supporters are causing mayhem in the streets. If he wins, there will be nothing but bedlam all over the place, but he’s not going to win. He may be the worst presidential candidate in history, and I got him, I got him. It actually puts more pressure on you. If you ran against a great candidate, there’s actually less pressure. You want to know the truth. Thank you. Thank you. No, we want to keep our country great. We’re bringing it to a level that it’s never been. Our military has equipment the likes of which nobody has ever seen, no country has ever seen, all made in the USA, rockets, missiles, tanks, ships, the likes of which, jet fighters, bombers, tankers, the likes of which no country has ever seen before. Our nuclear arsenal is the strongest by far in the world, the strongest it’s ever been. And hope to God, we never have to even think about using it. And the way you won’t have to use it is to have it. At our debate, Biden could not name a single law enforcement organization that supports him, not one, and that’s because … And by the way, did Vice President Mike Pence do a great job? Right? Did a great job. But it’s because Biden and Harris, that’s another great one. There was nobody so mean to Biden than her, nobody. And so, brilliantly, I said he can’t pick her, because nobody treated him as badly. Although I will say this, had Elizabeth Pocahontas Warren got out prior to Super Tuesday, we would have had Bernie instead. But I’d rather have Biden, because he’s now alienated the left. He’s alienated the right. Nobody knows what the hell he stands for. How about Pennsylvania? He goes to Pennsylvania. For a year-and-a-half, he’s against fracking. The day he gets the nomination, through a little luck, because she didn’t get out. So she took all of Bernie’s votes, right? But following day, he said, “I’m in favor of fracking.” But he’s not. And it doesn’t matter, because the radical left will never let Pennsylvania and Texas and Oklahoma and North Dakota and Ohio, never let them frack. That’s over with. But can you imagine? And the press, which is fake and corrupt, the press never said … Have you ever heard him asked? No. Have you ever heard him asked once, “Well, wait a minute. For one year, you said there will be no fracking.” And he said it strongly, right? You know, “Read my lips.” Right? To use an old expression, “Read my lips, there will be no fracking.” That didn’t work out too well. So now he goes, and he says there will be fracking. Not once have I heard the question. Not once have I asked why Hunter was able to take $3.5 million from the wife of the mayor of Moscow. Not once have I heard these frauds back there. Not once have I heard the fake news. Not once have I heard him say, “A billion dollars. If you don’t change that prosecutor, you’re not getting the billion dollars.” And then he goes, “Whoa, the prosecutor was changed.” The prosecutor against his son. Not once have I heard them talking about that question. Can you imagine if we did that? And on top of everything else, the Democrat Party declared war on our great police and law enforcement. That’s what it is. So I proudly received the endorsements of the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Association of Police Organizations, the National Troopers Coalition, the International Union of Police Associations, the National Latino Police Officers Association, the Florida police chiefs and all of these incredible organizations, plus all over the country. And when I asked him, “Name one organization, give me one organization.” During our debate, where he was saved by the moderator about four times, he couldn’t answer it. Name one law enforcement organization. He couldn’t name one. Then I said, “Say the words, law enforcement, just say it.” Couldn’t do it. He couldn’t say it. We’re joined tonight by a great group of people, warriors, really warriors. He came to me a couple of years ago. He said, “Sir, I want to run for governor.” I said, “Ron, I don’t know. Do they know you well enough?” But he was a great defender and a brilliant guy, Harvard, Yale, top of his class, smart as hell. Nobody knows how smart. Don’t tell too many people. He likes to catch you by surprise. But he’s a great, great guy, and he’s been a great friend. I said, “All right, I’ll endorse you.” I endorsed him, and the rest … he went like a rocket ship, and he handled the pressure. And his wife, Casey, is better than him. I’ve been saying it for a long time. Governor Ron De Santis and Casey. Great guy. Great, great couple. Great, great couple. Smart, brilliant. Sit down, please. Really, they’re a great group of people. Those people are great, and he surrounds himself with incredible people, with the exception, of course, of Representative Matt Gaetz. Oh, Matt Gaetz. You talk about a warrior, right? Ron, what do you think, huh? Matt Gaetz is a great man, a great gentleman, and what a future he has. I don’t know about swap it, but I think I might. Thank you, Matt. Thank you.. Thank you both for being here. Appreciate it. John Rutherford. Where is John? John? Thank you, John. Mike Waltz. Mike, thank you. Thank you. Nice couple. Gus Bilirakis. Gus? Gus? Congressional candidate, somebody who’s supposed to be potentially a superstar. Now, we’ve heard that a lot. Sometimes it works out. It’s going to in his case, Scott Franklin. Scott? Thank you. Oh, he’s got the look. He could be. That’s good. That’s good. I hear good things, Scott. Going well? How’s he doing, Ron? He’s doing good? Ron says you’re doing good. Good. You got to win it. Thank you, Scott, very much. Kimberly. Where’s Kimberly? Kimberly? Thank you. I watched you coming in, speaking. I said, “That’s a lot to follow.” Kimberly is great. I want to thank Kimberly. And finally, we’re joined by a group of amazing supporters who recently walked away from the Democrats and will be voting for us. We have a lot of, a lot of them. And a lot of them in law enforcement, a lot of law enforcement, they were democrats, in some cases they left their party. In other cases, they just said, “No, we’re voting for Trump.” I said, “Why are you doing that?” “We have no choice.” I said, “You’re right, you’re right.” But nobody’s been better to law enforcement than I have. You know when I first came in, we gave away hundreds of millions of dollars of military equipment that was in storage. Wasn’t doing anybody any good, it was collecting dust, probably paying rent all over the place. That’s probably why they had it, come to think of it. But look how far that crowd goes back. Hey, hey cameras, will you please? Oh man, look at that. Man. That’s into those hangers. Wow. You know, these are the real polls. So when did you hear about this meeting, like a day ago, these are the real polls, right? The other guy gets out there and he’s … they work at work and work and 30 people show up. They put them in those crazy circles, right? They only have the circles because that’s the only way they can fill up the room, it’s true. But that’s a fantastic group of people, thank you. Same thing over here. I wish the fake news would turn the cameras. For a long time, I didn’t think the cameras moved that way, but then anytime there was a little sign of problems, they could twist around like a pretzel and I realized they could. But they don’t like to show those crowds, but that is a massive amount. I don’t know how many people are here, but you got a lot. I want to thank you. So this evening, we’re also praying for all of the families on the Florida Panhandle effected by Hurricane Sally. And I will tell you, Ron and Marco, and everybody, I’ll tell you, Rick, everybody’s been calling and calling. Matt Gates has been going … driving us a little crazy. Matt, you can take it a little easy. But that’s what somebody that’s good is supposed to do, right? You’re supposed to call. But we take care of the Panhandle and we’re doing it at a level that’s never been done before. And I’ve done it, I think I can say right from the beginning, right? I tell the story about Ron DeSantis. He came to see me, he just became governor. “We had a hurricane. Sir, thank you very much for the money you send to the Panhandle in Florida. I appreciate it.” “Good, Ron, good. I hope it’s enough. Good, spend it well.” I get a call like three days later. “Sir, could I see you?” Now, I’m in Washington. I say, “You don’t have to come up, tell me.” “No, no, no, it’s very important. Sir,” comes into the oval office, “Sir, could we have an extra $500 million?” I said, “Ron, will it ever end, Ron?” And one thing I found out, it never ends for the Panhandle and for Ron, but we take care of it, right, Ron? We take care of it. Great, great people, you have great people. They’re warriors, I’ll tell you. They’re warriors, they’re fighters. We need more people like that, I will tell you. Last month they approved a major disaster declaration for the state of Florida. And I’ll be with you through every step of the rebuilding and you’ll be hit with others. The one thing we know about Florida, you’re very good at this stuff. You get hit by hurricanes and you rebuild, and you rebuild fast, and it’s incredible. I’ve watched, I’ve watched and you don’t want much help either. You’re proud people, you’re incredible people. You put it back together. But we’re there for you all the way. And were there monetarily and we’re there with FEMA. And I think Ron, FEMA’s been incredible, haven’t they, right? Yeah, they’ve been incredible. Thank you to FEMA. We have a lot of FEMA people here, right over there. We spent the last four years reversing the damage Biden has inflicted over the last 47 years with that ridiculous, dumb thought NAFTA, T.P.P., and China’s entry into the World Trade Organization, a disaster for our country. China is considered a developing nation. I stopped that. China’s considered a develop … in other words, China, they’re so wonderful they’re developing, isn’t that nice? Now by being a developing nation, they get much more benefits than a nation that’s not a developing. So I said, “Well, we’re a developing nation too, if they’re a developing nation.” And we just won, you know this, we just won seven and a half billion dollars from the World Trade Organization. And from the World Health Organization, I took us out. They said, “Why did you do that?” I said, “Number one, they were wrong on everything.” Although, they corrected themselves today and they said I was right for the lockdowns. But I said, “Number two, why are we paying 500 million a year? And China, which has one point four billion people is paying 39 million a year, explain that?” They couldn’t explain, it was very hard to explain. So I took us out for that and other reasons, okay. So we’ll see what happens with that. But these are the deals. I could go over hundreds of different things with you and just common sense. I mean, common sense, what we do. Think of it, World Health Organization, we spend … we have 325 million people, we spend $500 million. China spends $39 million and China dominates them. I said, “Doesn’t work that way anymore, doesn’t work that way anymore.” They’ll take us back in so fast at much less money. For decades, our politicians spend trillions and trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign wars and defending foreign borders. But now we are finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities, and we are bringing our jobs, and our factory, and our troops back home to the U.S.A. But those dismal days of betrayal and that’s what we were, we were betrayed by our own politicians, whether it was on purpose, or that they were just plain stupid. We’ll come back with unprecedented force if Washington Democrats are allowed to take control again, we can’t let it happen. You have got to get out and vote. Sleepy Joe Biden, and it wasn’t him, it’s the people that control him. He’s controlled totally. Has put forward the most radical platform in American history, including a plan to eliminate U.S. borders. Oh, that’s wonderful, where’s our border? We don’t have one, just come in, everybody come on in, come on in everybody. If you’re a murderer, if you’re a rapist, if you’re very, very sick with a disease that can spread all over, just come on in. We’re up to almost 400 miles of wall, nobody talks about that anymore. And we now have the tightest, safest border in our country’s history, but we’re up to almost 400 miles, it’ll be finished very soon. And it’s top of the line. It’s exactly what border patrol wanted. But by implementing nationwide catch and release, imposing deadly sanctuary cities nationwide, nationwide, they want sanctuary cities, that’s what they want. I don’t even think … I’ll tell you, I know a lot of people in California, they don’t want sanctuary cities. It’s like the politicians want it. I don’t think the people want it.But they want to suspend all removals of illegals out of our country, whether they’re murderers, rapists, thugs, bank robbers, they don’t care. They want to suspend it. You almost say, where the hell are they coming from? Where does it even … where does the thought process come? It’s demented. It would mean the total nullification of all U.S. borders, overwhelming every city and town in America, including this wonderful place that we all love very much. Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure border in U.S. history and we’re finishing that wall. It’s going to be finished and so beautiful, wait’ll you see that. Wait’ll see that. A few more months. We’re doing 10 miles a day. And by the way, Mexico is paying, they hate to say it. Mexico is paying for it. And Mexico’s been great. Mexico has 27,000 of their soldiers on our border. And I said, you have to do that, otherwise we’re going to have to charge you tariffs because we’re not going to stand for it. When people are pouring into our … and we have the worst laws because Congress over the years has made it so weak. If you’re a soldier and you talk rudely to somebody, they ended up giving you the electric chair, okay? It’s so horrible. Mexico has been great. 27,000 soldiers we have, see, 27. Now the electric chair comment, they’ll put that, “He’s exaggerating. He shouldn’t do that.” They are sick people. But it is true, we have 27,000 Mexican soldiers guarding our border and you know what, they don’t play games. They don’t let them through. And if they do let them through, we get very angry with Mexico. So Mexico’s been great. The president of Mexico’s been great. We’re putting a border tax on for cars and trucks that go across. It will much more than pay for our wall, starting soon. Remember when the old days we used to say, we’ll build the wall, everybody thought there was no way. It’s one of the largest projects in the history of our country, because you’re talking about a lot of miles, 540 miles. And then we may even add some more into other areas where you probably, you have natural barriers like mountains and rivers, and a lot of other pretty tough areas. But we may even add some more. We’re doing so great with it, 10 miles a day. And I want to thank the Army Corps of Engineers, you’ve been incredible. Some of them are here, they’re very proud people. One thing with the Army Corps, they may build it a little expensive, but you can’t rip that sucker down and it never [inaudible 00:00:44:30]. That’ll never come down. We ended the catch and release ridiculous program where you catch somebody, you take their name, and then you release them. And you say, come back in three years to a court case. And nobody ever comes back, except for the really dumb ones, they come back on occasion. But nobody ever comes back, they’re in our country. They could be murderers and they could be all sorts of problems and we’re not having that. We ended it. We stopped asylum fraud and we’ve deported 20,000 gang members, including MS-13. Brought them back to their country. We brought them back to their country. We’ve now deported over a half a million criminal illegal aliens, think of that, think of that. And outside of poorly run Democrat states and cities, you don’t have crime in this country. Our country is doing fantastically. And I call up governors in Portland, and I call up from the state and I call up the governor, as an example, Oregon. I say, “We’d love to send some people to help you out with Oregon and to help you out with Portland. We’ll solve the problem in a half an hour, like we did in Minnesota with Minneapolis. We’ll solve the problem quickly.” Remember Minneapolis was burning down, day after day and I’d call, let us come in, let us come in. Anyway, they finally came in. How long did it take? About a half an hour. Remember the beautiful scene, they lined up. They weren’t socially distanced, but that’s okay. They lined up, then another line, another line. Then they just walk forward and that was the end of that. And I think we’re going to win the state of Minnesota because of it, I think. Hasn’t been won since 1972, but it’s looking like we’re going to win Minnesota because of it because nobody, I mean what they did. But I give the governor credit, at least, even though it was too long, he let us in. Oregon, we have to send in the troops. We will solve that problem in 30 minutes. We sent in the U.S. Marshals. Recently, when the man, this horrible human being shot somebody and killed them in the middle of the street. Two days went by, three days went by, I said, “Why hasn’t he been arrested?” We sent in the U.S Marshals. In 15 minutes it was all over, 15 minutes. Be so easy to do. I mean, can you imagine these people for years and years, it’s been anarchy in Portland, for years and years. But not for the Republicans. This is why you cannot have the Democrats and that whole philosophy, that whole craziness, you can not have them involved in running your country. We invested two point five trillion dollars in the U.S. military, including funding to save Tyndall Air Force Base, because who knows Tyndall. Who is … well, not that big a group. That’s not like a big group. I can tell you if you were in the Panhandle, you’d be saying, thank you very much. It was wiped out by the hurricane and Ron called, and a number of people called, and Marco called, Rick Scott called, they all called. They wanted to save Tyndall and we did it. And now it’s brand new, gorgeous, and really moving along well, right? We did a good job there, I think so. We launched the first new branch of the U.S. Armed Forces in nearly 75 years called Space Force, very For an administration, if you think of it, so not for 75 years, we’ve created a new force, right? The Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines. So think of it, Coast Guard. And now we just created a new force, first time at 75 years, if I did nothing but that, that’s a big deal. And that’s peanuts, that’s peanuts. Because we built the greatest economy in history. We cut taxes more than any other president by far in history. We cut regulations, which I think is maybe just as important as the taxes, that’s why our businesses are roaring back. We’ve done things that nobody else has done, nobody else has. And these people back here, they don’t even challenge me on it, which is shocking. Usually you think they’d challenge you, even if they’re wrong. I also brought back NASA, the greatest space center, again, in the world. And we passed V.A. Choice and V.A. Accountability for our great vets, right? And we just got a 91% approval rating, Ron. 91% approval rating by the vets on the way we’re running it, never happened before. That’s never happened before, Rick, never happened before. We killed the leader of ISIS who was trying to reform ISIS because we blew it into oblivion. We killed al-Baghdadi, they were looking for him for years and years and years. Guess who got him? We took out the world’s number one terrorist and the mass murder of American troops and many, many people all over the world, Qasem Soleimani, he’s dead, gone. I withdrew from the last administration’s disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal, which was a catastrophe. President Obama give us $150 billion and we’ll give you nothing. Give us one point eight billion in green, in cash. He gave him one point eight billion in cash. That’s when I realized how powerful the presidency is, when you could do that. What a horrible deal. But we broke the deal, and I’ll tell you probably the first call I’ll get after we win the election will be from Iran dying to make a deal because they’re down 28% GDP, nobody’s ever heard of a thing like that. That’ll be the first call I get. They cannot have a nuclear weapon. I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. And every president promised to do it. Every president said they were going to do that for many, many decades. They all were going to do that. Nobody did it because once they got in office, there was a lot of pressure on you not to do it. I could tell you, I was called by every foreign leader, “Please don’t do it. Please don’t do-” Not to do it. I can tell you I was called by every foreign leader. Please don’t do it. Please don’t do it. I tell the story. I said, listen, tell them, I’ll call them back in a couple of days. Then, I did it. I called him back. Hey, what’s up? I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. 52 years they’ve been working on that. They’ve been working on that for 52 years. They couldn’t get anything. Every year, people would fly in, stay, wine, dine, have a good time and leave. Nothing would happen. 52 years. I got it done in one day. Instead of these endless wars, we’re forging peace in the Middle East and peace without blood all over the sand, and you see what’s happening. In fact, a point that they didn’t report, I’ve been, I guess three or four, maybe now, Nobel Peace Prizes. Can you believe it? Four, three. I told a story. I told my wife. Oh, we’re going to have a great time. We’re going to watch television. I just got nominated for the Nobel Prize. And then I turned on the fake news. Story after story. They talk about your weather in the panhandle run. They talk about this. Story after story. No mention. Remember, when Obama got it right at the beginning and he didn’t even know why he got it? It was the biggest story you’ve ever seen. The last administration made a pathetic one-sided deal with the Castro dictatorship that betrayed the Cuban people and enriched the communist regime. They’re not enriched any longer. My opponent stands with socialists and communists. He wants to give everything away to Cuba. He wants to give it away to Nicaragua and Venezuela, not going to happen, not going to happen, not going to happen. I stand with the people of Cuba and Nicaragua and Venezuela in their righteous struggle for freedom. The last administration also negotiated the terrible Obama-Biden Santos steel with Colombian drug cartels. They surrendered the narco terrorists. They surrendered totally gave up to him and that caused illicit drugs and illicit drugs all over this country. Joe Biden even received the endorsement of Colombian socialists, Gustavo Petro, a former member of the M19 Guerrilla organization, and he took it, because you know why, he didn’t know who the hell it was. He said, I’ll take it. I’ll take whoever. And I said, no, he’s a bad guy, Joe. He’s actually a bad guy. Under my administration, we worked with Colombian officials to seize or disrupt 227 metric tons of poisonous narcotics since April, and we’re doing fantastically in terms of bringing it down, 19% reduction. My heart will always be with the Colombian people and the people from Cuba and the people from Venezuela and Nicaragua and all of the people that are so unfairly treated, and you’ll see a lot of great things happen. I did more in 47 months than Joe Biden did in 47 years. And now he’s pushing the most far left agenda ever foot forward by a Presidential nominee or candidate. The Biden Plan would destroy Social Security and destroy protections for pre-existing conditions. You’re going to have nothing left, this crazy new Green New Deal. The Green New Deal. I mean, what’s that all about? Biden’s running mate sponsored The Green New Deal and the Socialist Healthcare takeover. You’re going to have Socialist Healthcare. You don’t feel well? Okay. Go to the hospital. Stay there for about four weeks. They’ll shut down american energy, shut down fracking and outlaw the private health insurance plans of over 180 million Americans who love those plans. Biden vowed to terminate our travel bans on jihadist regions and surge refugee admissions. He agreed to this with crazy Bernie Sanders. He’s going to surge admissions into our country by agreed number 700%. No, thank you. Opening the flood gates to radical Islamic terrorism, and I don’t like to speak too loud, but we’re not doing too badly, are we? He’ll ban school choice. He’ll ban charter schools and he’ll ban Florida opportunity scholarships, which is a big deal, a big deal. He wants to put him out of business run. In a second term, I’ll provide school choice to every parent in America. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans. And I just have to say in conclusion, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we will end our reliance on China once and for all. It’s ending. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities, which you’re already doing. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms, your second Amendment. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens, and we will keep America out of these ridiculous, horrible and very, very stupid foreign wars against countries that you’ve never even heard of. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency. It’s already signed and it takes place on January 1st, and further reduce the cost of prescription drugs by 50, 60, 70, and even 80%. We will strongly protect Medicare and Social Security, and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions, always. Republicans will always protect. America will land the first woman on the moon, and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars, and it’s going to be very soon. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, to honor our history and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, ” in God we trust.” For years, you had a President who apologized for America. Now, you have a President who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of Florida. So, get out there and vote. Send in your absentee ballot if you’ve requested one. Be very careful, a lot of shenanigans going on. You see what’s happening. Every day you’re reading it. In person early voting begins next week. So, get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors and get out and vote. You have no choice. You have to do it. True. You got to do it. We’re going to win Florida big. We’re going to win a lot of states big. We’re leading in Arizona. We’re leading in Nevada. We think we’re leading in Pennsylvania. We’re leading in North Carolina. We’re leading all over the place. We got to have this be a big win. From Tampa to Tallahassee, from Pensacola to Miami, and from Jacksonville to right here in Sanford, we stand on the shoulders of Florida Patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for this beloved nation. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes across the oceans, blaze the trails, settle the continent, tame the wilderness, lay down the railroads, dug out the Panama Canal, raised up the skyscrapers, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and from here in this beautiful state, landed our brave American astronauts on the face of the moon. We made America into the single greatest nation in the history of the world, and the best is yet to come. Proud citizens like you help build this country and together we are taking back our country. We’re returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. And when Ron DeSantis comes to my office in Washington, the magnificent oval office, and he says to me, sir, sir, the people of Florida, they’ve won too much. They’re getting tired of winning. I’m going to look at him. I’m going to say Mr. Governor, go back and tell them, don’t worry about it. You’re going to keep on winning, winning, winning. That’s what they want to do. We’re going to keep on winning, winning, winning. Because we’re one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God, and together with the incredible people of Florida, we have made America wealthy again. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again, and we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Florida. Thank you very much. Thank you.

"84","10-13-20","Hello, Johnstown. Thank you very much. This is going to be a great evening. Incredible to be back in Pennsylvania, the proud home of American independence, the American constitution and American freedom. That’s true. Huh? What a history. And 21 days days from now, we’re going to win the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and we’re going to win four more years in the White House. This election is a simple choice. If Biden wins, China wins, all these other countries win. We get ripped off by everybody. If we win, you win, Pennsylvania wins and America wins, very simple. For years, the selfish and corrupt political class betrayed the people of Pennsylvania, you know that, and the people of our country. Career politicians like Joe Biden lied to you. I don’t think he knew he was even lying. You want to know the truth. He’s gone. He’s shot folks. I hate to tell you, he’s shot. He abused you, he crushed you, your dreams and outsourced your jobs to China and distant lands all over the world. As a Senator Biden’s last American trade policies were a total disaster. They dismantled your steel industry and decimated entire towns in your area. And we brought back steel and we put tariffs on steel and we stopped dumping steel and aluminum. As vice-president, he closed down 10,000 factories while raking in cash from corporations that moved jobs overseas, and his family got rich. You know that. How did Hunter make three and a half million dollars from the mayor of Russia, mayor of Moscow’s wife? How did that happen? So you have the mayor of Moscow, got a wife, gave Hunter three and a half million bucks. I wonder what he did for that money, huh? The fake news, they refused to talk about it. They don’t want to hear about it. Biden’s a servant of the radical globalist, the wealthy donors, the big money special interests, who shipped away your jobs, shut down your factories and you know it, because you really suffered right in this area, threw open your borders and ravaged our cities while sacrificing American blood and treasure in these ridiculous, endless foreign wars. They’re all coming back home. Don’t worry. They’re all coming back home, soon. They’re already on their way. They’ve been on their way for a long time. In 2016, Pennsylvania voted to fire this failed and decrepit political establishment. And you elected an outsider as your president to finally put America first. That’s what we did. And we did not come this far, overcome this much, and fight this hard only to surrender our country back to the depraved, Washington swamp. And by the way, did we catch them? We caught them. We caught them. We caught them. Watch what happens. Watch what happens. They spied on our campaign. What they did should never, ever be allowed to happen in this country again, never. Watch what happens. This is the most important election in the history of our country. Biden has made a corrupt bargain in exchange for his party’s nomination. He has handed control to the socialists and Marxists and left-wing extremists like his vice presidential candidate. That’s another great one, isn’t it? I just watched her on television coming in, because the great thing about Air Force One, we have more televisions. They’re in closets. They’re all over the place. They’re on the floors, on the ceilings. And I watched her and I compared her to Amy, great future Supreme court justice. And I will tell you Amy’s made a great impression. And you know, Biden, he can’t stand up to the lunatics running his party. He can’t even find his way off the stage without them. Look what’s happened. Yesterday, he didn’t know the name. He said, “You know the guy, I think he’s a Mormon, right”” He said, “He’s a Mormon.” He was talking about Mitt Romney. He forgot Mitt Romney’s name. Can you imagine that? Can you imagine. Then he didn’t know where he was. He said, “Where the hell am I? Where am I?” No, he’s shot folks. He’s shot. I’m running against the single worst candidate in the history of presidential politics. And you know what that does? That puts more pressure on me. Can you imagine if you lose to a guy like this? It’s unbelievable. It’s disgusting. It’s disgraceful. If he wins, the radical left will be running the country. He won’t be running the country. The radical left will take over. And how about Pennsylvania? So he says, “There will be no fracking, no fracking.” This went on for a year and a half. No fracking, no fracking, no fracking. Then Elizabeth Warren refused to get out. So they stole another one for Bernie. Bernie is the greatest loser of them all. This guy, every four years they steal it. So she refused to get out, Pocahontas. She refused to get out. They wanted me to apologize for saying the word Pocahontas. So no, no. I apologize to Pocahontas, [inaudible 00:06:52]. No, no, she wouldn’t get out. And she took enough votes away and Biden won super Tuesday. That shouldn’t have happened. But if I don’t sound like a typical Washington politician, fortunately that’s because I’m not a politician. I’m not a politician. But think of that, you talk about politician, no fracking for a year and a half, right? And then he goes to Pennsylvania says, “No, no, there’ll be fracking.” Like nothing happened. Can you imagine if I did that? No fracking, no fracking, no fracking. I’m the opposite, by the way. No fracking, no fracking. Then you win and you go, I’ve got to go a little to the other direction, a little bit to the right. Although he actually went further to the left, which is sort of an amazing thing, but all of a sudden he comes out in favor of fracking. And let me tell you, it’s always the first thing that turns out to be true. Okay. They will lose, you will lose, in Pennsylvania a million jobs. There will be no petroleum products. There will be no fracking whatsoever. And did you see his party now is really angry at him because he’s saying maybe there’ll be fracking. It’s a very conditional, it’s a very weak, but with me, you’re going to frack. You’re going to frack. And you’re going to keep your energy low. And we’re independent, we are now energy independent, first time ever. So if I don’t always play by the rules of the Washington establishment it’s because I was elected to fight for you. And I fought harder for you than any president has ever fought for their people. Right now I’m fighting to eradicate the virus, rebuild the economy and save our country from the radical left. And that’s a big thing, saving it, because these people, this will end up being a large scale version of Venezuela, if they get in. They don’t have water. They don’t have medicine. They don’t have food. They don’t have anything. Despite everything they’ve thrown at us, we’ve done more in the first three and a half years than any administration in history. And the best is yet to come. That’s true. A recent Gallup poll just came out. Thank you. A Gallup poll just came out that found that 56% of Americans say they’re better off today than they were under Sleepy Joe and Obama. That’s the highest of any president at this point in his term. Let’s think of that, 56%. This is as we round the corner on the pandemic, 56%. they were much, much lower. Just remember this, if they were any good I wouldn’t have run for president, but they were no good. They did a horrible job. They did a horrible job. Yesterday, Biden told those 56% of Americans that they probably shouldn’t vote for him. And for once I agree with Joe. Did you hear? He said, “You shouldn’t vote for me.” He has no idea what he’s saying. How the hell do you lose to a guy like this? Is this possible. Oh, I’ll never come to Pennsylvania again. I love this place. They say he was born in Scranton, but he left. He left. He abandoned you. Give me a break. Thank you. I love you, too. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. By the way, there’s a lot of people here tonight. Got a lot of people. I wish the fake news would show it. They never turn the cameras. I go home, our great first lady always says, “How was the crowd?” I said, “Didn’t they show it?” “No, they just show your face.” And about five people behind me, right? They become famous. Why don’t you show the crowd though? Why don’t you do yourself a favor, show the crowd. One of the most important issues for Pennsylvania is the survival of your fracking industry. Joe Biden has repeatedly pledged to abolish fracking. He’s a liar. Okay. He’s a liar. How do you do it? How do you do it? He went for a year and a half. They said, “Are you…” remember the debates with the radical left Democrats? You had Alfred E Newman. You had all these people, you know who Alfred E. Newman is? Yes. Pete Buttigieg, Pete Buttigieg, he was a bad mayor of a failed town and he’s going to run for president. Pete Buttigieg, but you know he’s talking about it. And does that mean everybody, nobody is going to do fracking? That’s right. Nobody. Nobody, I swear. Nobody, nobody, nobody. Then he gets up, I’ve never seen anything like it in my life, and not one fake reporter back there said, “Well, wait a minute, you’ve been pledging for a year and a half, no fracking.” But then what about the healthcare for illegal immigrants? Who in this group is going to provide healthcare for illegal immigrants? Everybody raises their hand. You remember Joe? No, do you remember? This is a famous clip, but they don’t ask him questions about it because they’re fake. You remember Joe? Who is going to provide… And look, we all have hearts and we want to take care of everybody. But you know the problem when you do that, we don’t have the money. The whole world is going to empty out into our country. They’re going to come for healthcare. They’re going to come for college, free college. I say sometimes jokingly sarcastically, “Everybody gets a free Rolls-Royce.” To which CNN says, “They don’t get a free Rolls-Royce. He has misrepresented.” These people are sick. Everybody gets a free Rolls-Royce. They don’t get a free Rolls-Royce. The president has misrepresented. They are sick people. But think of it, so remember when Joe and they said, “Raise your hand if everybody’s in favor of free, everything, credit free everything, but free healthcare for illegal aliens.” And Joe goes like, he had no idea what the hell he was doing, folks. He has no clue. And he’s not a nice guy. Just so you understand, not a nice guy. If he was a nice guy, I wouldn’t hit him like this, but he’s not a nice guy. He’s a bad guy. He’s always been a dummy. He’s never been… No, no. In his best of years, he was considered a dumb guy. When asked about fracking, Biden said he “would sure, absolutely make it. We will eliminate it.” That’s what he said. Those are the exact words. And then he said it 19 different times. Then one day he said, “I never said that.” It’s incredible. And they don’t question him. I couldn’t get away with it for a minute, not for a minute. Did you see the town hall he had with NBC? That was a town hall for a child, a young child. Barron Trump, and actually Barron’s far too advanced for that town hall. That was a town hall, Lester Holt, Lester Holt. That was a beauty, right? That was some town hall. And they said, “Yes, we have a random sampling of people.” Yeah. All Trump haters. What a group of people. But he raised his hand. He said, “Illegal immigrants will get healthcare.” Now people don’t realize what that means. That means your social security goes down the tubes, your country goes bankrupt. The whole thing is a disaster, but he raised his hand. Now he’s trying to say he didn’t do it. And they don’t call him out because they’re fake. His radical left running mate, who I just watched on television, she is so pathetic, is a co-sponsor of the socialist green new deal, which eliminates all fossil fuels. She’s having a hard time getting out of that one. Did you hear the other day? She actually came out in favor of fracking. It was like, “Yeah, I think so.” She’s further left than Bernie. Did you see Bernie, I thought was the furthest left in the Senate, because you don’t get too much worse. Then you go, instead of socialists, you go to the C-word, right? She’s further left. She’s considered further left than Bernie. When Nancy Pelosi does the 25th amendment, she’s doing it for Biden. You do know that, right? Because they want to get Biden out and that won’t be hard. But at this very moment, Biden’s website includes a pledge to mandate net zero carbon emissions, which means fossil fuel, coal, everything is gone and it’s gone soon. Okay. And with that goes our economy, and with that goes our country. The Democrat party hates fracking. They hate coal. They hate clean, beautiful coal. I see what they do with coal now. They hate domestic energy production and Biden will shut you down. He wants to shut you down just like your governor’s got you shut down right now. They better open up your state. Did you see the World Health Organization yesterday? They said Trump was right. They said you can’t make the cure worse than the problem itself. I’ve been saying that for a long time. And we did the right thing. We saved 2 million lives. They said 2.2 million people. We saved 2 million lives and we get nothing, and I’ll tell you what, the vaccines are coming soon, the therapeutics and frankly, the cure. All I know is I took something, whatever the hell it was, I felt good very quickly. I don’t know what it was. Antibodies, antibodies. I don’t know. I took it. I said, I felt like Superman. And I said, “Let me at them.” No, and I could have been here four or five days ago. It’s great. We have great doctors. I want to thank the doctors at Walter Reed and Johns Hopkins, great doctors. One great thing about being president, if you’re not feeling 100%, you have more doctors than you thought existed in the world. I was surrounded with 14 of them. Where are you from? “I’m from this one.” Where are you from? “I’m from Johns Hopkins.” “I’m from Walter Reed.” But what great talented people. They did a great job and thank you. And while I’m president, America will remain the world’s number one energy producer with Pennsylvania workers leading the way and that’s what’s happening. You’re leading the way. You know, you had the best year in the history of your place. It’s a history of … if you look at the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, you never want to say state. Don’t ever say state. Actually, nobody cares but them, but you know. I’m just saying, let’s say Pennsylvania, you got two of them. You know that, right? The Commonwealth, the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. I went to school here. Probably spent more time here than sleepy Joe in all fairness, I went to school here. But we’re putting our great coal miners back to work. Joe Biden and the Democrat socialists will kill your jobs, dismantle your police departments. You see that happening. And we’ve got … Did you see in the debate the other night, I said to him, “Name one law enforcement agency, just one in a whole country that supports you.” He couldn’t do it. Then Chris Wallace bailed him out. Then I say, “How come you got the three and a half million from Russia?” And they bailed him out again. He was choking like a dog. They bailed him out. But they want to dissolve your borders. They don’t want borders. They want to have open borders, release criminal aliens, raise your taxes, confiscate your guns, get rid of your Second Amendment. I mean, here’s one that’s incredible, destroy your suburbs. Okay, so they talk about the suburban women. And somebody said, “I don’t know if the suburban woman likes you.” I say, “Why?” But we had this … I love you too. They said, “They may not like the way you talk,” but I’m about law and order. I’m about having you safe. I’m about having your suburban communities. I don’t want to build low-income housing next to your house. Okay, if that’s okay? And I ended the regulation, the rule that made the zoning so impossible that you had to destroy your communities. And then I hear the suburban woman. I think that the suburban woman, and I used to say suburban housewife, I used to take heat, but I said, “Does anybody care?” Do you care? If I say suburb? No, they’re all going to no. Again, the only one cares is them. “Trump said suburban housewife,” but I didn’t say it because I don’t. You learn very quickly. You learn very quickly. But suburban women, they should like me more than anybody here tonight because I ended the regulation that destroyed your neighborhood. I ended the regulation that brought crime to the suburbs and you’re going to live the American dream. And that’s what you’re going to do. And remember this, 29% of the people experiencing the American dream in the suburbs happened to be minority. And you don’t know that. But 29%. and we’re doing this for everybody. We’re not doing it one way or the other. We’re doing it. And I ended it. They said, “Sir, we can amend it.” I said, “I don’t want to amend it. I want to end it.” It was a horror show. And this loser, Corey Booker is the guy that’s going to be in charge of the program. The guy’s a stone-cold loser. 1%, he got 1%. He ran. He was going to be great. You know, 1%. every week he was like her, down, down, down. They should’ve picked him. But no he’ll be in charge of you’re a suburban …So can I ask you to do me a favor, suburban women, will you please like me? Please. Please. I saved your damn neighborhood, okay? The other thing I don’t have that much time to be that nice. You know, I can do it, but I got to go quickly. We don’t have time. They want me to be politically correct. Yes, let’s discuss it. Let’s talk about it over the next 10 years. No, no, no, no. We saved suburbia in the US. I got rid of a regulation that was a disaster. And it was very unfair. And you’ve been reading about it for a long time. It’s been going on for a long time. It became much worse under Obama and Biden. I got rid of it. And I had a choice. Even my own people said, “You’d never get rid of it, sir.” I said, “I want to get rid of it.” “Well, why don’t we just amend it?” I said, “I don’t want to amend it. I want to get rid of it.” Get rid of it. Okay? And I think we’re going to see that the women really like Trump a lot. That’s happened last time. Remember? Remember last four years ago? Four years ago, they said women will never vote for him. I said, “Why, am I so bad?” They said, “The women will never vote.” Then I got 52%. They said, “What the hell happened with the women?” Except this time, see, this is much easier. Because then I was a developer, I was doing great, everything was nice, but I had never done this before. I came in, I said, “I’m going to rebuild our military. I’m going to cut your taxes. I’m going to cut your regulations. I’m going to get you this, I’m going to get you that. I’m going to take care of our vets.” I mean, I did things that frankly, I never even talked about like space force. I never talked about space force. The wall is almost built. You know, the wall is up to 392 miles. It’s almost built. And Mexico is paying for the wall by the way, you know that. I’ve been saying it. They hate to hear that, but they’re paying. We’re putting a charge on where the cars go through and it will more than pay for the wall. But we have now the most secure Southern border that we’ve ever had. And I want to thank the president of Mexico. They 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our Southern border, stopping people from coming into the US illegally. Thank you very much. No, but we did all these things. So this time in theory, it should be easier. But don’t forget, I’ve gone through years of a fake witch hunt. And now it turned out that they were the guilty party. They were the ones dealing with Russia. They were the guilty people. Think if I didn’t have every night on that fake CNN, right over there with the light on. The light just went off. It just went off. Every time I point to them, the light goes off. It’s all right, keep it off. Nobody’s watching them anyway. But think if I didn’t have every night, Russia, Russia, Russia, hey. And nobody’s been tougher on Russia than me. What I’ve done for NATO. Raised $130 billion a year from other countries that weren’t paying their bills. They were delinquent, as we said in the real estate business. They were delinquent. And that goes up to $410 billion. Nobody did that. Obama used to send them pillows maybe from the pillow man on Fox. Did you ever see a man advertised so much? I’ve never seen it. I’ve never seen the biggest advertising … I think he’s the greatest advertising genius, Mike. If I gave him our budget, you wouldn’t be able to do anything else but watch Trump ads. The pillow, man. I tell you, I never saw so many ads in my life. Every day, it’s a pillow, the pillow. Now he came out with a sheet and I’m going crazy. That’s all we need now is a new sheet. But he’s on our side too by the way, that guy, he’s on our side, Mike. And now Biden even refuses to answer questions on packing the Supreme Court. You know, elections have consequences. Winning and losing an election, that’s big consequences. And we’ve been winning elections. And they say, “Well, you know, Trump shouldn’t be appointing the new justice because …” well, I’m president. In fact, as you know, a lot of your great justices said, “No, no they’re appointed.” Justice Ginsburg just said recently, not so long ago, “No, no. He’s a president for four years. Not for three years. You appoint …” Now, she was referring to Obama, I think, or Clinton or somebody. But wasn’t referring to me, I can promise you that. Oh, don’t worry. Don’t worry. It’s being filled. You don’t have to worry about that. That’s much easier than we’ll build a wall that goes to … that goes for a lot. You know, the wall is one of the biggest projects in the history of this country. You know that right? And we had a party dedicated to the proposition that there will never, ever be a wall. They know was the right thing to do. And I made one big mistake. I should’ve come instead of saying, “We will build a wall,” I should have said, “We will never, ever build a wall.” They would have given me so much money. Made a big mistake. All great congressman over there. Are you guys having a good time, by the way? Huh, Mike? He said the voters don’t deserve to know. And they’ll tell you after the election what he’s going to do. And you know what I did, I gave you a list. I have 45 people on that list. Every one of them is a star. And I gave you a list. Yeah, sit down, everybody. Just enjoy yourself. What the hell? Look at these people. I didn’t even realize you’re all standing. I didn’t realize you had seats. You’re lucky. This is one of the few crowds we provided seats. That’s because it’s Pennsylvania, I guess. It’s pretty good. If they win, Democrats will pack the Supreme Court with radical left justices who will shred your Second Amendment. You can forget about guns, empower violent mobs, and shield deadly criminals and terrorists. To defend our constitution from this madness, I proudly nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett of the United States Supreme Court and to the court. She’ll be a great justice of the United States Supreme Court. She’s done so well. I really found it fascinating today. I don’t have too much time, but I tried to watch as much as I could. She was great. The radical left is hellbent on destroying everything we love and cherish. They’re enraged and unhinged. And they are going crazy. Think of it, very many presidents never have anybody to appoint. I will have by the end of the first term, almost 300 federal judges and three Supreme Court justices. Their heads are exploding. I hope they’re happy. They want to cancel you, shame you, and persecute you. That’s what they want to do. They want to shame. And this whole cancel culture thing. Now they’re after Abraham Lincoln. They don’t like Abraham Lincoln. No, he wasn’t too good was he? I said this three years ago. Remember when they took down a couple of statues of people you’d never heard of? A Confederate soldier, somebody else, somebody … I said, “Oh, really? Then next will be Robert E. Lee. Then next will be Abraham Lincoln. Then next will be George Washington.” And everybody laughed. They said, “Oh, the president is so funny.” I said, “I’m not being funny. These people are sick.” These people, they want to take away your heritage. And by the way, are there any Italians in the room? Okay, well, we are protecting the legacy of Christopher Columbus. The Italians are tough. I love the Italians. So they were going to rip down the statue of Christopher Columbus in New York. You saw that, right? And all of a sudden, a group of Italian circled around the statue and they were having pretty tough things in their hand, I must say. And it was amazing how those people that wanted to rip it down disappeared very quickly. So the Italians, let me tell you, Christopher Columbus will always be here on my watch, that I can tell you. I had people the other day that wanted to wish me Happy Columbus Day. They were afraid. I said, “Why are you ashamed? No, no, say it. Happy Christopher Columbus Day.” This is Christopher Columbus Day. It’s Columbus Day.” So Italians say, “Thank you Mr. President.” I appreciate it. I like you too. I love the Italians. They want to punish the middle-class, expunged every last trace of traditional values, and replace the American dream with the socialist nightmare. And that’s what would happen. Just take a look at what’s going on in other parts of the world. Biden’s agenda, not that he has one, but you know. He does whatever they tell him to do. He got so lucky. She should have gotten out. She was faithful, she would have gotten out. Bernie would have run. We would have been running against crazy Bernie instead. But I’d rather run against Joe because there’s no enthusiasm. There’s no energy. One thing with Bernie’s people … And you know, we got a lot of people last time from Bernie because they loved me on trade, because they know our country has been ripped off on trade like no country has ever been ripped off. And Bernie’s people get that. And they like us on trade. Biden’s agenda would be a catastrophe for seniors. For years, Biden tried to cut social security and Medicare. Nobody remembers that. And the press will never bring it up. But he tried to cut your social security. Now Biden is pledging mass amnesty and federal health care for the illegal aliens, decimating Medicare and destroying your social security. Biden cares more about illegal aliens than he cares about your senior citizens and it’s true. And let me just tell you this. And I say it strongly, and when I first got elected, they always played the social security card. And nothing happened. Your social security now is better than ever. I haven’t touched it. While I am president, no one will touch your Medicare or your social security. Under my leadership, we’re delivering a safe vaccine and a rapid recovery. If you vote for me, prosperity will surge. Normal life, that’s what we want. Normal life. We want normal life. We’ll fully resume. And next year will be one of the greatest economic years in the history of our country. It’s already happening. How about the stock market? Who has 401ks in the audience? Well, I can tell you one thing, I’m getting all of your votes. I’m getting your votes. Your 401ks is setting records. Think of it, as we’re rounding the turn and we are, they go crazy when I say we’re rounding the turn on the pandemic. We understand it. Hey, I just had it. Here I am. It’s actually me. And I could’ve stayed in the basement of the White House or maybe the top floor of the White House. I could have done that, but I’m the president of the United States. I can’t do that. I got to get out and I have to meet people and I have to see people. And I know it’s risky to do that, but you have to do what you have to do. I’m the president. I can’t sit in the basement and say, “Let’s wait this thing out.” I’m not going to do that. And now I’m immune, they tell me I’m immune. I could come down and start kissing everybody. I’ll kiss every guy, man and woman, man and woman. Look at that guy, how handsome he is. I’ll kiss him. Not with all of enjoyment, but that’s okay. Joe Biden would terminate our recovery, delay the vaccine, prolong the pandemic, and annihilate the economy with draconian, unscientific lockdowns, like you’re having right now in Pennsylvania with this governor who is killing you. Tom Wolf, Tom Wolf. Come on, Tom. Open up Pennsylvania, Tom. Open it up. You know what’s going to happen? November 4th, they’ll open it up. You know that? They want to keep the numbers as bad as possible. Here’s the problem. The numbers are going to come out just before the election. So we have November 3rd, the numbers are going to come out. And Pennsylvania is a late voting state. You actually believe in going to a poll because you see all the shenanigans. No, you’re a late voting state. And all I can tell you is when I came here and I said this before, but when I came here, I promise you a lot of things. I’ve done much more than I promised you. You’ve had the best year you’ve ever had, and you’re going to have a better year next year. You damn well better vote for me, Pennsylvania. You better vote for me. Sleepy Joe Biden’s plan will crush America. And my plan, we’re going to crush the virus very quickly. It’s happening already. It’s happening. Almost 90% less mortality. You know, the mortality rate is at like 85. If you had it seven or eight months ago, it was not as good as if you have it now. And soon it’s going to be perfecto. And I said that the drug that they gave me, we’re going to be distributing it all over the country to hospitals and everything else, because I’ll tell you that sucker works. That’s my opinion. What do I know? But to me it works. And the people that did it. They’re phenomenal people. They’ve had great success with other vaccines and drugs. Just this week, we learned that another member of the Biden family is getting rich off connections to Joe. His son-in-law, just came out, big story, is cashing in on the China virus pandemic, just like Hunter. Where’s Hunter? Crashed in on China. What do you think when Hunter walks in and he walks out with a billion and a half dollars to manage for China. I said to a friend of mine, one of the biggest guys on Wall Street, “Does that ever happened?” He said, “I’m the biggest guy on Wall Street. That doesn’t happen for me.” 10 minutes, he had a billion and a half dollars. Maybe he’s not so stupid after all. To fight the China virus, we launched the largest mobilization since World War II. And we really should get credit for what we’ve done, because I’ll tell you Mike pats and all of these people, they have worked 24 hours around the clock. Our early and aggressive action saved as many as 2 million lives. Remember when they said, “No, no, no. You don’t want to ban China. Don’t ban China.” I did it in January. They were talking a month and a half later, we shouldn’t be doing it. He called me xenophobic. I said, “Joe, give me a definition of xenophobic, please.” He was unable to do that. We pioneered lifesaving therapies and reduced the fatality rate by 85%. I’m working with the FDA to make the antibody treatments I received. And everybody … we’re going to have them. They’re going to be shipped very soon. We’re working on an emergency use authorization, very complicated stuff. And the FDA has never responded like they’ve responded to me. This could have taken years what we’ve done and we’ve done it in weeks. I know they came to me on one thing and they said, “Sir, well that will take approximately two and a half years.” I said, “No, it’s no good.” “When do you need it, sir?” “Next week? Tomorrow? How about tomorrow?” No, we’re pushing them hard. The FDA has been great. To everyone fighting to recover from the virus, I feel your pain because I felt your pain and we will beat this virus together. Who has had it? Who has had it here? Who’s had it? Yeah. A lot of people, a lot of people. Well, you’re the people I want to say hello to because you are right now immune. You are right now immune. Or they say that. You know, they hate to admit it because I had it. So in the old days they said, “Well, if you have it, you’re immune for life,” right? Once I got it, they give you four months. It’s anybody else but me, you’re immune for life. Through operation warp speed, which is incredible, we’ll have 100 million vaccine doses before the end of this year, 100 million, and the vaccine will end the pandemic once and for all. And remember this because I have the endorsement of, I think, every major law enforcement and minor law enforcement group in the country. We have a lot of Democrats that left their party and they came over, law enforcement people. I can almost tell you by looking. Look at this group over here. I know the law enforcement people. Nobody’s been better. We had all this surplus military equipment. Obama didn’t want to give it out because he said it looked too militaristic. I said, “No, I want to save lives. Okay?” It’s defensive equipment. I want to save lives. And we gave out hundreds of millions of… It was sitting in warehouses all over the country, military equipment, and we gave it out. But there’s nobody like the great men and women of law enforcement. Nobody. Look at that. Whoa. Whoa. See? They love you. See that? Wow. I didn’t expect that. That’s pretty good. That’s great. But this election is about law and order. You look at Portland. We keep saying to the governor, “Look, governor, Oregon.” I said, “Governor, let us go in. We’ll solve the problem in 30 minutes.” They don’t want to do that. You know, they’re supposed to ask you to come in. We did a great job in Minnesota, Minneapolis, except you know, instead of 10 days, they could have called us like two hours later. But they came in and they lined up and they were not socially distanced. They lined up. You saw that. They came in wearing black uniforms, 250, 000 and most expensive uniforms. I never saw so many computers on a helmet. But they went in and they had their tear gas and they had their pepper spray, which the other side doesn’t want us to use anymore. They said, “No, we don’t want to do that.” These people are a lot of bad people out there. You know, they’re anarchists, radical, left anarchists. Okay? So they came in. They came in. You saw it. There was one person. I said, “Where are the rest?” Then another one. Then another one. Then they started getting off buses, wherever. All of a sudden, you had one line, two line, and they just started moving forward. That was the end of the problem. It ended within 30 minutes. It was over. It was over. And we’ll do it wherever they want us. We’d love to go into Portland because those guys are bad news. You saw we sent in the U.S. Marshals, right? Because one man, horrible guy, shot somebody right through the head, shot him in the middle of the street. A guy who wasn’t hurting anybody. He killed him. Two days went by. Three days went by. I said, “Why the hell haven’t they arrested him?” And they knew who he was. And we sent in the U.S. Marshals. And in 15 minutes it was all over. That was the end of it. That was the end of it. Biden Harris and the Democrat party declared war on our police. Okay? And we’ve proudly received the endorsement of the National Association of Police Organizations, the National Troopers Coalition, the International Union of Police Associations, the Pennsylvania State Troopers Association. Wow. The Fraternal Order of Police including those in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Scranton and virtually every single police organization that we know. And during the debate, I asked sleepy Joe, I said, “ive me one organization, law enforcement, that’s endorsing you.” And he couldn’t do it. Then Chris Wallace saved him. Then I said, remember I said, ” Sir, tell me, say the words law and order. Say it, Joe. Say it.” He couldn’t do it. He wouldn’t do it. He wouldn’t do it. Because you know what? Because he’d been run out of his party if he said the words law and order. Then I think at the end, didn’t he say like law, and order, and safety, and justice, and you know, all the stuff. No, no. Law and order. Say law and order, Joe. He couldn’t do it. So we’re joined tonight by some real warriors, warriors of a different type, political warriors. They’re okay too, right? And they’re friends of mine. They’re great people. Representative John Joyce. John, please. A guy has been around a long time and he fights like hell, G.T. Thompson. G.T., thank you. Great. Be careful with your election. I hear you’re only up 40 points, G.T. Another one is only up about 44 points, a really good friend of mine and he’s tough as hell, Mike Kelly. I say G.T., Mike, you need any help, I’ll come and help you. The say, “No, sir, we don’t really need help. Don’t worry about it.” A friend of mine and a great gentleman, and he was the first one that predicted that I was going to win this thing. I’ll tell you, former Congressman Lou Barletta. Thank you, Lou. Thank you, Lou. How are we doing, Lou? Are we doing okay? How do we compare to four years ago? Better. Okay, good. He said the right thing. Anyway, yeah, I think a lot better, because we produced. Again, four years ago. I said we’re going to do things. Now we’ve done them all plus additional things, I mean a lot of additional things. I never talked about Space Force. We did Space Force. You know, somebody did Space Force. That’s like a major achievement for four years. That’s one thing. That’s like one thing out of so many other things. So it’s one of those things, but I never used to talk about that. And former chair of the Pennsylvania Republican party, a friend of mine, the guy that knows more about Pennsylvania than any human being on earth, Rob Gleason. Rob, thank you. How are we doing Rob? Good? Okay, good. He said to me another group came down. They didn’t want his advice. They came down from Boston and they put events all over the place and he said, “You’re going to the wrong location.” Anyway, they ended up losing big. Right? But with us, we came to Rob. We say, where do you think the best places are? And we hit. And we agreed with you too. But Rob Gleason has been a fantastic friend. Thank you, Rob, very much for being here. I appreciate it. And with their help and your help, we are delivering for the American people like never before. Nobody’s ever done what we’ve done in three and a half years. No administration’s ever done this the first three and a half years. In my first three years in office, family income increased by $6,000 and that doesn’t include energy, which I think you could double it up. More than five times the gains in all eight years of the Obama administration. African American income grew nine times more than it did under the last administration. Think of it. African American income grew nine, not two, not three, nine times more, and these are out of the book. These numbers are out of the book. Real well for the bottom. 50% grew nearly twice as fast as it grew for the top. 1% Hispanic family net worth increased by 64% in a short period of time, 64. We added nearly 600,000 manufacturing jobs and we added 15,000 factories, and Obama said “You’ll never produce manufacturing jobs.” Remember? You need a magic wand. Well, we found the magic wand. We lifted 6.6 million Americans out of poverty including over 1 million African Americans, and more than 1.5 million Hispanic Americans. And we’re doing great with both groups and we love them. We love both groups. Thank you. Those are great numbers. After our tax cuts took effect, wages for the lowest income Americans grew twice as fast as those near the top. Think of that. You never hear that stuff. The big beneficiary were lowest income Americans. My policies have benefited those who need it the most. After the virus came in from China and we had to change. We had to do things. This came out. It was a sudden horrible thing. China should have never, ever let it happen. They should have never let it happen. We’ve seen the smallest economic contraction of any major western nation by far, and we’ve seen by far the fastest recovery of any nation. In the past five months, we’ve created a record 11.4 million jobs, that’s American jobs. That’s the fastest ever recorded. Job growth has been 23 times faster than the first five months. Think of this. For the first five months of the Obama Biden recovery, 23 times. We cut unemployment rate in half. Under Biden, it took 30 months to recover more than half the jobs lost to the crisis. We did it in five months. So we’re talking about numbers that nobody can even believe. Homebuilder confidence has reached an all time high. We’re in a pandemic. Reached an all-time high. Manufacturing optimism has doubled. Consumer confidence, which just came out, has surged nearly 20%, and small business confidence is now higher than any time in the entire decade proceeding my election. Think of that. And we’re rounding the turn on our pandemic. We’ve spent the last four years reversing the damage Joe Biden inflicted over the last 47 years. He made every bad deal in the book. And by the way, if you look at the H1N1, you know, he calls it the N1H1, right? I said, “No, no. H. Here’s the way you remember it, Joe. H comes before I.” And he goes, “The N1H1, whatever it’s called. What was his name again? Or the Senator? Maybe he was a governor.” Yeah, Romney. Romney. “Oh, that’s right. It was Romney.” It’s amazing. You know, amazing. And he gets away with that stuff. You only see it. You only see it on the internet. They never report it. They never report it. They should report it. They’re doing this country a great disservice by not reporting it. But Biden supported NAFTA, TPP, and China’s entry into the WTO, which is one of the worst things that ever happened to this country. For half a century, Biden twisted his blade into the heart of the American worker. He should not be asking for your vote. You should be begging for your forgiveness. He did a rotten job. Okay? Did a rotten job. For decades our politicians spent trillions and trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign wars and defending foreign borders. But now we’re finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities, and we are bringing our jobs, our factories, and our troops back home to the USA where they belong. Almost done. Syria, we’re gone, except we kept the oil. Does anybody mind that I kept the oil? So we left some troops behind to keep the oil. With Iraq, we’re almost out. With Afghanistan, 19 years in Afghanistan, 19 years, and we’re really serving as policemen. It’s great to be policemen, but they got to have their own policemen. They got to do it themselves. But we’re, we’re bringing them home. We’re down to a very few number of soldiers. To save our auto industry, I withdrew from the last administration’s transpacific partnership disaster. It would have been a disaster. Would have destroyed your automobile industry and others. To defend our steel and aluminum workers, I imposed historic tariffs on dumped goods. Remember when they were dumping steel all over the place? You guys were getting killed. Saving those industries from total destruction. And frankly had the plague not came in from China, but now they’re doing well, anyway, had that not come in, you would have had a steel industry that would have been at a level that nobody’s ever seen before. But it came in, but you’re going to be there anyway in a short period of time, unless some stupid person comes along and raises your taxes by four times what they should be, which is what they want to do. I ended the NAFTA nightmare and signed the brand new USMCA into law. Everyone said that was going to be impossible to do. And I withdrew from the job killing Paris Climate Accord. So nice of them to tell us that we can’t use our energy. That was an accord. You know what that was going to? Destroy our country. That’s what that was going to do. If you look at what has happened over the last very short period of time, the progress that this nation has made, you’re not even going to believe it and you’re going to see it. And you would have seen it had the plague not come in because it was all happening. We were at every single record, but now we’re getting close anyway. The jobs are all coming back and the market is almost going to be topping the market from before the plague. And it’s pretty amazing. I will tell you. Biden has vowed to rejoin this horrible agreement, a death sentence for your state’s energy industry, The Paris Accord. It’s a terrible thing. Unlike Biden, I know my job is to represent Pennsylvania, not Paris. We’re representing Pennsylvania, not Paris. Got a lot of nice people. They can represent Paris. I took the toughest ever action to confront China’s rampant theft of American jobs. You know that. We charged them so much. We gave a lot of the money to our farmers, $28 billion to our farmers because our farmers were targeted. Everybody get your money. They did better without even growing anything, to be honest. But we got it from China, $28 billion, and we had a lot left over that went into the treasury of the United States. To defend American workers, earlier today I also signed an order to crack down on Chinese counterfeiters and merchants who sell their fake products all over the United States. They put the name Tiffany, Tiffany. It’s got the blue box, everything. Tiffany, Tiffany, Tiffany. Isn’t that wonderful? But it wasn’t made by Tiffany. Biden will eliminate my tariffs on China. He’s already said he’s going to take the tariffs off China. There goes your steel industry. There goes your aluminum industry. That goes everything. Allowing them to plunder without consequence. The one constant in Biden’s platform is surrender. He surrenders. He surrenders whether it’s a China, whether it’s Cuba. How about Cuba? How about the deal they made with Cuba? How bad was that one? I ended it. That’s why both China and the far left are desperate for a Biden win because he will surrender our jobs to China. China will own the United States if that sleepy guy gets the position. Okay? And you can forget about Pennsylvania. And you know, don’t also forget, your streets will be surrendered to the mob. You know, Republican areas are great. They’re doing great. The crime is at record lows, everything else. These are the Democrats, super liberal Democrat areas. Unlike sleepy Joe Biden, I will never abandon our nation and I will never abandon its values. My goal is not to make friends in the D.C. swamp. My goal is to fight for you and fight for your family. In 2017, I proudly signed a historic executive order making it official government policy to buy American and hire American. My opponent has put forward a radical plan to eliminate U.S. borders by implementing catch and release programs. And I ended. You know what catch and release is? You catch a murderer, you catch a rapist coming across our border, and you release him. Catch, catch him and release him. And you say, “I’m sorry. Three years from now, please come back for a court case.” Nobody comes back. Imposing deadly sanctuary cities and suspending all removals. They don’t want any removals. This is what Biden agreed to with crazy Bernie Sanders. When you have people that are in this country illegally, even if they’re murderers, if they’re rapists, no matter what they are, you can’t remove them. We’ve removed tens of thousands of people including MS-13. It would mean the total nullification of US borders overwhelming every city and town in America, and especially in a place like Pennsylvania. Biden wins, your borders are gone, which means your healthcare is gone, the middle class is gone and your safety is gone. Other than that, you’ll be doing very nicely. Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure border in US history and we’re finishing that wall. It’s going to be built very soon. It’s going to be finished. We’re going to have the greatest celebration. That was a tough one. That was a tough one. Remember they said, “We don’t need a wall.” They wanted drones, drones flying around looking at the people pouring across the border. They wanted drones. They wanted modern technology. You know what I’ve said often, right? There were two things that will always be around in a thousand years, in 2000 years, all new computers, all new everything. You come up with a new computer. You come up with a new chip. Three days later, it’s obsolete. I would not want to be in that business, but there are two things, a wall and a wheel right? A wall and a wheel. In a thousand years, 2000 years, it’s going to be here. We invested $2.5 trillion in the US military and launched the first new branch of the United States Armed Forces in more than 75 years, Space Force. For our great vets. We pass VA choice and VA accountability. Nobody thought would ever get that done. We killed the leader of ISIS, Al-Baghdadi, and we took down 100% of the ISIS caliphate. And when I took over, that caliphate was all over the place. It was a mess. We took down the world’s number one terrorist and the mass murder of many American troops, many troops, many people all over the world. Qasem Soleimani is dead. Thank you. He’s dead. I withdrew from the last administration’s disaster, Iran nuclear deal. One of the worst deals I’ve ever seen. That’s John Kerry, the guy was totally incompetent. That guy didn’t know what the hell he was doing. He gave him $150 billion, 1.8 billion in cash for nothing. I kept my promise, recognize the true capital of Israel and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem. I also recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. 52 years, I’ve been trying to get that. And instead of endless war, we’re forging peace in the Middle East, you see the deals we made? I actually got nominated for a Nobel Peace prize. The press didn’t cover it, but that’s okay. The press didn’t cover it. I got nominated for three Nobel Peace prizes. I did more in 47 months in Joe Biden did in 47 years and that’s true. Now Biden is pushing the most far left agenda ever put forward by a presidential nominee. He’s going to ruin your energy. He’s going to ruin your state. The Biden plan would destroy social security and destroy protections for preexisting conditions because there’s no money. Biden’s running mates sponsored a bill to outlaw private health insurance. We have 180 million people with great private plans. They want to keep it that way. They’re going to outlaw. They’re going to get rid of them. Biden vowed to terminate our travel bans on Jihadist regions and surge refugee admissions by more than 700%. he agreed to this. He said, “That’s okay. Let them come in. I got the ban right? Remember the ban. Remember who’s a big deal. I got the ban. I said, “If it’s okay, we have unfriendly countries. If it’s all right with you, they’re not coming into our country. I got the ban. We won in the Supreme court, five to four. I got the ban.” He wants to give up the ban. He wants to let people pour into our country. 700% increase opening the flood gates to radical Islamic terrorism. I don’t want to speak too much. Made of wood. This is real wood. I don’t want to speak too much, but you haven’t seen too many things happening lately have you? He’ll ban school choice, charter schools and Pennsylvania opportunity scholarships. In a second term, I will provide school choice to every parent in America. It’s so important. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans and in conclusion and I love being back with you in Pennsylvania. So many incredible memories really. So many. What a night that was. Remember that night? Donald Trump has won the commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Donald Trump. Remember how late? They just didn’t want to call it. They didn’t want to call it. I said, “Call it already.” We were at 98%. We were substantially ahead. If I lost every single vote, we still won. It took him like till two o’clock in morning before they called it. In the meantime, Wisconsin came in and Michigan came in, but they just refused to call Pennsylvania. They just couldn’t. Remember them crying and they were all stirred up. Over the next four years. We’ll make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we’ll end our reliance on China once and for all. That’s already happening. We’ll hire more police, increased penalties for assault on law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities that people don’t want. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms, your second amendment. We’ll strike down terrorists to threaten our citizens, and we will keep America out of endless foreign ridiculous wars. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military mind and we will ensure peace through strength. And by the way, we’ve rebuilt our military. I told you $2.5 trillion. We have weapons and equipment, the likes of which no country has ever seen before. We are the envy of Russia. We are the envy of China. We are the envy of everybody. There is no country that has what we have. And I will tell you when I first came here, one of our generals highly overrated said to me, “Sir, we have no ammunition.” That’s where we started. And now we have the greatest weapons anywhere in the world. And just hope to God, we never have to use them. We will then surprise medical building, require price transparency which is already signed January 1, it kicks in, and further reduce the costs of prescription drugs. And I’m talking about 50, 60, 70, 80% because of what I’ve done with favored nations, getting the lowest price Mike, the whole world. We’re going down. We’re taking these nations. They pay a fraction of what we pay. I said, “Nope, whatever they pay, I want to pay.” Why are we paying more than any other nation? We’re the highest. We’re going down to match the lowest. The drug companies don’t love me too much just in case you haven’t heard. We will strongly protect Medicare and social security. We’ll always protect patients with pre existing conditions. America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars, and we’re very close. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our school. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, in God we trust. For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of Pennsylvania. It’s very important. So get your friends. Most important election we’ve ever had. Get your family, get your neighbors and get out and vote. You got to get out and vote like you’d never voted before. Places that we won like Erie. Places that we won, you got to get out and vote because from Erie to Easton, from Pittsburgh to Harrisburg and from Allentown to right here in Johnstown, we stand on the shoulders of Pennsylvania patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for this beloved nation. This is the state where our founding fathers declared American independence. Think of what you have in Pennsylvania. Who can say that? This is it. What you’ve done here, what the history of this incredible place, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, think of what you’ve done. It’s where the army weathered its brutal winter at Valley Forge and General George Washington… Don’t worry. His statues are not coming down. Led his man on a daring mission across the Delaware and where our nation was saved by the heroes of Gettysburg. This is the place where generations of tough, strong Pennsylvania workers, mine the coal, work the railroads, and forge the steel, that made America into the greatest and most powerful nation in the history of the world. And you have seen nothing yet. Wait till you see what we’re doing. We are making our country greater than ever before. Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. And when you’re great Congressman to come to see me, right? It’s great. What a group of warriors. I don’t know with them. I’m not sure I can handle that group, but when they come in to see me in the Oval Office, they say, “Mr. President, Pennsylvania is not used to winning this much. We got to slow it down a little bit.” And I’ll say, “Mike, I’m sorry. Mike, you tell the rest of them Mike. We’re not going to slow it down at all.” Pennsylvania wants to win more than anybody in this country wants to win. Pennsylvania is going to win. We’re never going to stop. We’re going to keep on winning. We’re going to win so much you’re going to love every moment of that era. And you know what? You lost long enough. I can tell you that. Many years where your factories in your plants left because we have stupid leadership. Don’t kid yourself. You lost for a long time. And now you’re winning and you’re winning like never before. Open it up Governor. Open it up. Because we’re one movement, one family, one people, and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of Pennsylvania, we have made America wealthy again. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again, and we will make America safe again and we will make America great again. Thank you very much Pennsylvania. Thank you. Get out and vote. Vote, vote, vote.
















"
"85","10-14-20","Thank you very much. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you very much, everybody. Hello, Des Moines. Oh, it’s been a good time we’ve had in Des Moines. I even brought a hat. They said, “Sir, it is so windy out there.” I said, “Well, my hair is very powerful. It’s very strong. It can handle it.” But I bought it just in case. It may get pretty bad. But it’s pretty windy. So thank you all very much. And I’m thrilled to be back in the American Heartland with thousands of loyal, hardworking Iowa patriots. And 20 days from now, we’re going to win this state. We’re going to win four more years in the White House. We’re going to keep it going. And I must tell you, I’ve just looked. The poll just came out. We’re up six. Okay. Big deal. Didn’t we win by 11 or something. We’re up six. And if I’m up six, nobody has ever done for Iowa and the farm belt and the farmers and all, no more estate taxes, no more anything. I saved ethanol. Ethanol is saved. For me to only be up six, I’m a little bit concerned. I’ll tell you that. There’s nobody’s going to do for Iowa what I did for Iowa. We’ve just learned through, explosive documents, published by a very fine newspaper, The New York Post, that Joe Biden has been blatantly lying about his involvement in his son’s corrupt business dealings. And this is a big smoking gun. The newly uncovered emails reveal that a top executive from the highly questionable Ukrainian company, it’s an energy company which paid Hunter at least $50,000 a month, but it’s now looking like it could be $183,000 a month. That’s a lot of money. Would anybody in this audience take it? I’ll take it. We’ll take it. Despite the fact that he had absolutely no experience, knew nothing about energy, wrote to Hunter arranging for a meeting to meet with Vice President Joe Biden. I’ve been saying this for a long time with that family. The same Ukrainian energy executive even sent Hunter an email saying, “We urgently need your advice on how you could use your influence.” In other words, Hunter was being paid for access to his Vice President father, who was specifically put in charge of Ukraine and Russia. How about the Russia hoax? It turned out that they were the ones that did the Russia hoax. It was them. No collusion. No collusion. These emails show that Biden’s repeated claim that he has never spoken to Hunter about his business dealings were a complete lie. It was a total lie. He lied to you over and over because he’s trying to cover up a massive pay for play scandal at the heart of his vice presidency. And everybody knows it. Everybody in Washington knows it. We’ve known it for a long time. The fact is there was never an administration more corrupt than the Obama Biden administration. There was never. Never. Just weeks ago, Joe stood before the American people in a presidential debate and told you that these claims had been totally discredited and that his son did nothing wrong. But now that turns out to be a total lie. Now we can see clearly that Biden is a corrupt politician who shouldn’t even be allowed to run for the presidency. I was pressing Joe Biden to tell the truth because the corrupt lame stream media, right back there, all those cameras right back there, they’re corrupt. And they refuse to write the story. There wasn’t one time in almost four years during my presidency, during the greatest political scandal in U.S. history, a witch hunt, a horrible, horrible, disgusting witch hunt that should never, ever happen to another presidency again, and people should pay for the crimes they committed. Which turned out to me at total illegal hoax that false and libelous stories every day, false and libelous stories, and they knew they were false, too. They knew they were false. They were never taken down by Twitter or Facebook or the mainstream media. Never once. Yet with Biden today, they take negative posts down almost before they even go up. They’re trying to protect them. They’re trying to protect Biden. They take them down. And I was just getting off that magnificent plane behind us, Air Force One. And I had heard, and I just don’t know this for a fact, but they say Kayleigh McEnany, you know Kayleigh, right? Kayleigh McEnany. Good Kayleigh. She’s so great. She’s incredible. They closed down her account. She’s the White House Press Secretary. Because she’s reporting the truth, they closed down her account. So let’s see what’s going to happen. And did you hear the news? Bruce Ohr is finally out of the Department of Justice. Bruce Ohr. Him and his wonderful wife, Molly. She wrote all this stuff. And then he goes and he works at Department of Justice and he took it, didn’t he bring it to the FBI? The wife writes that she gets paid a lot of money. Bruce Ohr is finally out of the Department of Justice. That’s good. Couple of years too late, that’s all. He should be not only in the Department of Justice outbox, he should be someplace else, okay? Eight months after his alleged meeting with the Burisma executives. So these Burisma, Burisma, they say, pronounce it Burisma, a real beautiful company, Vice President Joe Biden went to Ukraine and threatened to withhold $1 billion in aid if they did not fire the prosecutor that was investigating his son and the company that his son worked for. That’s Burisma. The documents also show that before one of Joe’s trips to Ukraine, Hunter emailed his business partner saying his lucrative contract should begin now. Think of that. Should begin now, right now. It’s got to begin. The whole thing is so incredible. Here’s a guy, look, let’s just put it in simple language. He got thrown out of the military. That’s unfortunate. He didn’t have a job for a long time. His father becomes Vice President, and he’s making millions and millions and millions of dollars a year. Think of it. No, think of it. Think of it. It’s like the Hillary stuff, the crooked Hillary. And it’s the crooked Joe. You know, when a Democrat voter here in Iowa asked Joe last year, you remember, if his son raked in money in exchange for providing access, Joe pulled that man a damn liar. “You’re a damn liar.” Kid’s making millions of dollars. He had nothing. He didn’t have a job. Thrown out of the military, sadly, but thrown out of the military. And he knew nothing about energy. He knew nothing about investments. Knew nothing about China. How about he walked away a billion and a half dollars to manage for China? They don’t do that with the most brilliant people on Wall Street. Vice President Biden, you owe the people of America and apology because it turns out you are a corrupt politician. Okay? Joe Biden must immediately release all emails, meetings, phone calls, transcripts, and records related to his involvement in his family’s business dealings, influence panelings around the world, including China and including Russia, including Russia. Hunter raked in a fortune from China while Joe Biden was giving China all of our jobs. We know where they came from, Iowa and plenty of other places, but they came from Iowa. He was giving them. They were taking our jobs. They were taking our factories. They were taking everything. They were taking our wealth. And I gave you $28 billion. Say, “Thank you very much, President Xi.” It came right out of China. And because of that, everybody’s happy in Iowa. I just hope you remember that on November 3rd. Hope you remember. Nobody else would have done it. Nobody else would have done it. The Biden family treated the vice presidency as a for-profit corporation, flying around the globe, collecting millions of dollars from China and Ukraine and Russia and other countries. In fact, the wife of the mayor of Moscow gave Hunter Biden a check for $3.5 million in cash while his father gave away the store to Russia, including Crimea. Remember Crimea? The Bidens got rich while America got robbed. By contrast, and this is so true and so easily true, and I’m so proud of it in so many ways, I’d given up billions of dollars to serve as your President and it’s my greatest honor of a lifetime. It’s so true. Where's my hat? I ran for President because I could not sit back any longer and watch the terrible injustices being done to the American people. And it’s true. And by the way, before the China plague came in, we had the greatest economy in the history of the world, and now it’s going right back there. Our stock market is very close to a number that was even higher. Does everybody have your 401k ready? Because it’s going through the roof. We’re going to have the best year we’ve ever had, and we’re going to have tax cuts not tax increases. They want to increase your taxes. They want to increase your taxes so they can spend it on the green new deal. That’s another beauty. I can not sit idly by and watch career politicians like Joe Biden continue bleeding this country dry. And that’s what it is. You know, you can say whatever you want. You can say whatever you want, but when you have a kid that follows his father, and by the way, take a look at his brother, his brother, all of-who is his father? And by the way, take a look at his brother. His brother, all of a sudden is building a big housing development in Iraq. “Have you ever built a development before?” “No, I haven’t.” Take a look at the whole family, it’s a corrupt family. Joe Biden, personifies the selfless and corrupt globalist who got rich and powerful at your expense. Take a look at the people that are funding his campaign, people assumed that they’d be funding my campaign, I don’t want them, we don’t want them, we never needed them, we don’t want them. But they betrayed American workers, disparaged American values and crushed our middle-class. For decades, Biden and his cronies laughed while they shipped millions of your jobs to their friends in foreign countries, in countries that you’ve never even heard of. They live behind gated walls and they flooded your communities with illegal immigration, deadly drugs, MS-13 savages that assault, rape, and murder innocent Americans. They forced our fellow citizens to live in crumbling inner cities while they spent trillions of dollars on never ending foreign wars, they just never ended, but we’re bringing all our soldiers back home, you know that, we’ve been doing it for a long time. And it’s not easy, the military industrial complex, not the easiest thing, but we’re bringing them back home. We’re almost finished in Afghanistan, coming in, we’re dealing… We’re down to a small number coming home by the end of the year, hopefully the end of the year, shortly thereafter. In Syria, we’re out, totally out. And by the way, we crushed, before I did this, we crushed 100% of the ISIS caliphate, 100%, we crushed 100%. We have the greatest military in the world, and by the way, we have built the greatest military in the world. So, I just tell you from Iowa, you’re a very powerful state, politically, you’re a big state to me, big in your heart, but you have a tremendous influence and a tremendous power and you’ve never let me down, you just came in and we won by so much. They say if a Republican wins by one point… I think I won by 11, right? 11. That was early in the night, remember that? They said, “Donald Trump has won the state of Iowa.” Then they said, “Man, he went by 11 points, what’s going on?” That was just the beginning. Then we won Ohio, we won Ohio by eight points, I said, “What’s going on?” It’s one thing you want to say, but when you wouldn’t buy a lot, and that was the beginning of something. And I’ll tell you what, we have more enthusiasm now than we ever did four years ago, that really is true. And we have great poll numbers, although you see a lot of the fake poll numbers they’ll do anything they can to call suppression pools. There they go. Look at the red lights, they start to go off as I start to put… In one way they want the ratings, in another way they don’t want to have the ratings and you’re telling CNN that they’re a fraud in their broadcasting. That was one of the greatest evenings ever. There were those who say it was the most exciting evening in the history of television, highest rated evening in the history of television. And, you know what? The election we have coming up on November 3rd is actually more important. In 2016, you voted to fire the failed and decrepit political class and you elected an outsider as your president, and I finally put America first, it’s called Make America Great Again. It’s windy out here. If you can wear the hat, I can wear the hat. Should I take off the tie or not? What do you think? I don’t know. Maybe, yes? Oh, that feels so much better, that feels better, that feels good. Now, we can all just relax and have a good time. No, but it’s great to be with you. Seriously, we’ve had a great history here together, what we’ve done for you, and what we’ve done for the farmers, and what we’ve done for everything. Two weeks ago, you had the largest order of corn in the history of our country, right? Two weeks ago, you had the largest order of soybeans in the history of our country, and the largest order of beef, but you know why? Because China wants to keep me happy, that’s why. It was from China, because they know what they’ve done to us should never have been allowed. They could have stopped it, they didn’t stop it, they should have stopped it. The only reason I’m your president is because the previous administration did a poor job, so poor, in fact, that I said, “I’m going to run for president.” And you know what? If they did a good job, I wouldn’t have run. And if they did a good job, I guess, I wouldn’t have won, when you think, I wouldn’t have run and I wouldn’t have won. But they were so bad, and it turns out there was so totally corrupt. We did not come this far to overcome this much and fight this hard only to surrender our country back to the deprived Washington swamp. When I would say, “Drain the swamp,” I used to say it, “Drain the swamp,” and people liked it, I hated the expression, I hated it. I just said, “This is a hokey expression.” And I put it on one speech the place went crazy, I said, “I’m starting to like that expression.” Then I put it in another speech and they went crazy, I said, “I really like it.” But when I said drain the swamp, I had no idea the swamp was that dirty, that disgusting, and that deep, it’s true. If I don’t sound like a typical Washington politician, it’s because I’m not a politician, thank God. And I don’t want to insult our great politicians because you have some great ones with us tonight. But if I don’t always play by the rules of Washington and Washington establishment, it’s because I was elected to fight for you harder than… And I’ll tell you what, I fight for you harder than any president has ever fought for anyone, it’s not easy. But I love it because we’re making tremendous progress. And the fact is that, no administration in their first three and a half years has ever done as much as this administration has done, you take a look at the last ones. And it’s amazing because they challenge you on everything, they never even challenge me on that statement. I make that statement all the time, they just stand there and they say, “[inaudible 00:35:23].” They grit their, they say, “He’s right.” “We might hate him, but,” they say, “he’s right.” Right now I’m fighting to eradicate the virus, rebuild the economy, and save our country from the radical left, and that’s exactly what we’re doing. As a candidate, Joe Biden has made yet another corrupt bargain in exchange for his party’s nomination. He has handed control to the socialists, and Marxists, and the lunatic left-wing fringe that are really running that party, he’s not running it. Let’s face it, Joe is shot, okay? Whether you like it or not. We can all be nice. It’s going to be my turn someday, it’s even going to be your turn someday, my friends, someday. But you know when it is your turn, you can’t be president. One thing I’ve learned, President Xi of China, he’s a 100%, Putin of Russia, 100%, Kim Jong-un… By the way, whatever happened to that war we were supposed to be in? Kim Jong-un of North Korea, 100%. These people are sharp and they’re smart, Joe has lost it. In his best day, he wasn’t a smart man, everybody he knows that. But Joe has gone. If he wins, the radical left will be running the country, they’re addicted to power, and God help us if they get it. We’ll never be the same country and we will never be able to recover. And we are on a basis… And I’ll tell you something, the country was coming together. I was telling a very, very, actually a very good reporter today, that our country was coming together because we were having such success that I was being called by people that normally I wouldn’t be speaking to too much, they don’t want me, I don’t want them. But we had the best employment numbers in history, African-American, Hispanic American numbers, women, Asian, everything, high school diploma, without high school diploma, colleges, PhDs, we had the best numbers in every category, 160 million jobs, we were never even close to that, we were at 160 million jobs. And it was all coming together, people let’s get together, let’s talk. It’s like splitting up the riches, really, and in a positive way, splitting up the riches. And what happened is, we then got hit with the plague and now it’s back to the drawing boards, but we’re going to have a strong V the quarter, the third quarter is going to be incredible when you see the numbers. Not that I know anything, because I don’t want to give you inside information because I don’t have it. They’ll say, “He’s giving away inside information,” they are sick. But wait till you see the third quarter numbers, and it’s going to be right before the election, before the November 3rd, although a lot of people will have voted by that time, get out and vote, you got to get out and vote. But we were really coming together because that’s… Look, ultimately, we want to come together, everybody come together. And we were really coming together and then we got hit by this horrible situation, could have been stopped. China stopped it from going into the rest of China, but they didn’t stop it from coming out and going to Europe, and the United States, and the rest of the world, 188 countries. So, we’re now putting it together. We had it done and now we’re doing it again, and next year will be even stronger than last year. Last year was the best year we’ve ever had, and this coming year will be even better than last year. Unless somebody comes along and says, “Let’s quadruple your taxes,” which is what they want to do. They want to raise your taxes. They want to go with this ridiculous Green New Deal, which by the way, their original price, a hundred trillion, you couldn’t do it for that. If we did great every year for a hundred years, everything was perfect, right? No nothing, no recessions, no anything, you couldn’t make a hundred trillion dollars. These people are crazy, and they actually mean it. So, we’re going to get it going to a level that nobody can ever turn course on us, nobody can ever change. I tell the story for years as a student of economies, I just love it, I love watching it, I love doing it, and I love seeing the results because the results have been so incredible. But as a student, I used to hear for years, for 10 years, 2019 China… Because look, let’s face it, China is 1.4 billion people, we’re 325, not including illegal immigrants that are in the country, frankly. And we don’t even know what that number… I said, “How many do we have?” “We have no idea, sir.” Well, I have an idea… By the way, our Southern border is now stronger than it’s ever been. But we have 325, 330 million people. But for years I heard that China will overtake us as the world’s largest economy in the year 2019, you’ve all heard it, I think, right? Yes? He’s a very smart looking guy, you’re loaded with money, I bet, look, that’s why he’s in the front row. He’s in the front row and he didn’t have to stand there for three days to get there, I could tell this guy. But, right? 2019 that China was going to overtake. Well, you go back six months, seven months, not only weren’t they overtaking we were beating them by leaps and bounds and getting bigger and bigger, and growing and growing, and taxing them and taxing them, and taking in billions and billions in tariffs. And when they targeted Iowa and the farmers of this country, and ranchers, and others, I said, “No, you can’t do that, no, you can’t.” And I put a 25% tariff on everything and I gave a lot of the money… I don’t want to say it too loudly, 28 billion, I gave you 16 and 12. I said to Sonny Perdue, Secretary of Agriculture, great guy, loves… He knows more about farms. I said, “Sonny, what’s the number?” He said, “Two years ago, sir, 12 billion they hit us 4. And last year, 16 billion.” I said, “That’s okay. We’re going to put a 25% tariff, the farmers are going to get 12 billion and then they’re going to get 16 billion, okay? And we’re going to give that money to our farmers.” And that got our farmers even. In fact, I shouldn’t tell you this because they don’t like this, but some of the farmers were making more money the way that Iowa was doing than by working their asses off, all right? They were very, very happy. But no, we took care of our farmers, no other president is going to do that. No other… That’s why China got away with all of these stuff for years. And we had plenty of money left over after the $28 billion, it went into the US treasury. But they got away with it because they had threatened a president like Obama, we’re going to target your farmers, we’re going to target the middle of our country, and Obama would say, “We better not get involved.” I said differently. I said, “If you do it then what we’re going to do is we’re going to tariff your goods away, give a lot of that money to the people that you’re targeting.” And the thing that most impresses me about Iowa, Nebraska, and a lot of other States, if you look… By the way, Minnesota was so great, all of them, every one of them, Wisconsin was incredible. They never came to me and said, “Sir, you can’t let this happen. They’ll stop re-ordering, they’re not ordering from us.” They never said it. You know what they said, “The president is right, at some point we have to put up a stand.” And I didn’t hear one even from fake CNN, they put people on television that said, “I know it’s not good, but the president is right.” You did the right thing. Because otherwise, it puts me in a bad negotiating position, you can’t really negotiate, it’s tough. I’ll never forget that about the farmers, it’s incredible. The other thing I won’t forget… You don’t mind if I go off script, this stuff is…Enough with crazy Hunter Biden and making millions of dollars a day, he made it because of his great intellect. No, but you know the other thing… Where’s Hunter? Is Hunter here tonight, by the way? Hunter, congratulations on making a lot of money last year. The other thing I remember in the White House, we had 36 farmers come to see me, I’ll never forget it. And they were getting hit really hard, this was two and a half years ago, early. And they came in to see me, almost all farmers, and they said, “Sir, we’re hurting, but you’re doing the right thing, sir.” I’ll never forget this meeting, it’s early… I’ve pictures of it. Many from Iowa, but from other states, but many from Iowa. And I never saw… Because everyone’s always asking me for money, “I want money here. I want… Countries want money.” Our so-called allies are always asking for money, ” Please defend us.” Even though… And then they rip us off on trade. We defend them and then they rip us off in trade, they’re always asking for money. So, the farmers are in, and I said to them, “You know what I’m going to do? I’m going to do a big thing, I’m going to get you a lot of money and I’m going to do for tariffs, and I’m going to do this to…” This is very early on in the strategy. “And I’m going to subsidize you guys, you’re going to be so happy.” And I used a terrible word. They said, “Sir, may I speak?” “Yes, you can. What do you want to say?” “We don’t want subsidy, sir. All we want is a level playing field, we don’t want anything. All we want…” It’s true, right? It’s true. I never heard that. Most people, they don’t care, call it subsidy, call it, give me cash, just give me money, the farmer said, “We…” And by the way, I could see there was a chill in the room when I mentioned that word. I said, “Did I say something wrong?” The farmers are unbelievable, they’re the heart of this nation. They said, “We don’t want subsidy.” I’ll never forget it. “Sir, we don’t want subsidy, we don’t want that. We just want a level playing field, sir. We’ll beat anybody. We want a level…” And it’s to this day… I tell that story all the time, because I don’t hear that, most people they don’t care you can call it anything you want, you call subsidy, you call it anything you want. I just think you people are incredible, okay? That’s it. Enough of that or I’m going to make him cry, and he hasn’t tried in 40 years, that guy. One of the most important issues for Iowa is the whole thing that happened with ethanol, they were killing ethanol, and Joe Biden has vowed to abolish fossil fuels, he supports all of the outside… This crusade to eliminate gas powered cars, and his running mate sponsors the insane… She’s the most liberal… By the way, did Mike Pence beat her [inaudible 00:46:36]? The expression in boxing or as my friend, Dana would say, UFC, if that were a fight, they would have stopped it, right? We love Mike Pence and he loves Iowa too, he loves Iowa, he just left. The Biden-Harris platform will demolish Iowa ethanol, you know that, wiping out the entire industry. And we fought hard for it, we went through the whole thing where we had no demand because of the pandemic and we all fought hard to keep it going and keep the ethanol going. And we did the 12 months… I did 12 months, remember it was eight months, I said, “Why not 12?” And they couldn’t give me a very good answer. But I made it year round and 15%, right? Up from the 10, 15%, and it’s great stuff. And when the market comes back, which is coming back, but in the meantime you have inexpensive gasoline, that’s not so bad, right? There’s nobody who ever thought they’d see gasoline with a two in the front of it and less, and we’ve saved all of our energy jobs. And whether we like it or not, when we are having problem with energy, I called Russia, and I called Saudi Arabia, and they reduced production by more than 10 million barrels a day and our entire energy was saved all over the world, frankly, they’re not doing it for us, but they’re doing it for, let’s say, everybody. And we have an incredible country and we saved our energy industry, our energy jobs, and we are energy independent, and it’s a beautiful thing. And by the way, I also made a little promise most of you won’t understand, for those people in the ethanol world, you can use the pumps, okay? Do you understand that? You can use the pumps. In other words, you don’t have to go out and spend hundreds of millions of dollars on new pumps. Because with the additional ethanol, the additional power, some people say, “Oh, make them buy new pumps.” No, I don’t want you to buy new pumps, you don’t have to. So, for those people that understood what I just said, you know what I’m talking about, right? Using the pumps, that’ll be okay. To defend our rights in our constitution, I nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the United States Supreme Court. Right? And I’ll tell you, I don’t mind running against sleepy Joe, but I wouldn’t want to run against her right now. She has to promise… Please promise me, Amy, you’ll never run. Now, she’s been great, she’s so outsmarting these people with bad intention. You look at some of the questions that are being asked and you… It’s so obvious, these are not great chess players. Let’s face it, they’re not great, but they’re horrible, just horrible, nasty, and she handles it like nothing. She’s a great intellect. And one of the reasons she is a highly respected professor who’s been teaching for many years, I said she was the single greatest student that he’s ever had, and that sold me. I believe in that kind of thing, it’s called intelligence, I believe in intelligence. But I just want to… I haven’t spoken to her in a few days, I want to just say that we made the right choice, right? With Amy. And speaking about making the right choice, you made the right choice a long time ago with a man named Senator Chuck Grassley. And you made the right choice and you’re going to do it again, I hope, because she’s great, Joni Ernst. And they’re right now in Washington fighting to confirm our great new justice, our future justice of the United States Supreme Court. Joni has been fantastic and she’s been for Iowa values for a long time. She’ll call me, “Sir, can we do this?” Nobody called me more on ethanol than Joni and Chuck. In fact, I used to duck their calls, “Just tell him I’m not in. I can’t take it anymore, Joni.” But that’s what a good Senator is, they want to keep your state going, they want to keep our country going, they love our country, they love our state that they represent. So, Joni Ernst, you got to get her in. And Chuck Grassley, we don’t have to worry about him, he’ll be around forever, he’s great. You know what I love about Chuck Grassley? He’s got that voice, that great voice. Even when he’s being nice, he sounds like the toughest guy, right? And he’s being nice. And he looked at Comey, remember? The corrupt FBI director. And he looks at Comey, corrupt guy, and he just said, “Did you leak?” And Comey joked, “Yes, I did.” He said in the House, and let’s see what happens to him. But I’ll never forget Chuck Grassley, and he didn’t mean it to be mean, he just sort of got that rough voice. “Did you leak?” “What? Yes, I gave it to my college professor friend from Columbia.” Remember that? We love Chuck, what a piece of work he is. If Democrats win, they will pack the Supreme Court with radical left judges who will shred our second amendment. And believe me, if they win, your second amendment is gone, okay? They’ll empower violent mobs and shield deadly criminals and terrorists, it’s very simple. Joe Biden refuses to even answer questions on packing the Supreme Court. How about this? They go up to him, “Do you want to pack the court?” “I’m not going to answer that question.” You know why? Because they don’t ask it if he doesn’t… Me, it would be like… Forget it. But they say, “Are you going to pack the court, sir?” “I’m not going to answer that because I don’t want to say.” “Oh, okay, good. Next question.” No, can you believe it? This is the essence of our country, we can’t allow this to happen. And the other thing is, they don’t ask the second. I put up a list of 45, great, brilliant conservative, in our case, justices that go by the constitution as written et cetera, okay? So… He’s got to put up the name of justices or judges, whoever he’d pick to become a justice of the Supreme Court, he’s not doing that, they’re not asking that question, they don’t ask. Did you see the NBC thing last week where they had an NBC town hall? It was designed for a child, okay? When I get in, they ask me things that nobody ever even contemplated could be thought of. This guy, they’re asking him these questions, nobody can believe it. In fact, NBC took a lot of heat, they took a lot of heat. Biden’s agenda would be a catastrophe for Iowa seniors, everybody knows that. For years, Biden tried to cut social security and Medicare, do you remember that? You do know he wanted to cut your social security and your Medicare. Now, Biden is pledging mass amnesty and federal healthcare for illegal aliens, decimating Medicare and destroying your Social Security. And the problem is we all have a heart. I say it all the time. I’d love to take care of everybody all over the world. The problem is our country can’t afford it. And if you start saying we’re going to give free education. We’re going to give you Medicare. We’re going to give you healthcare. We’re going to give you everything. Our country will be flooded with millions and millions of people that are going to come from all over the world. They will decimate our country. You can’t do it. Biden cares more about illegal aliens that he does for your senior citizens. It’s true. I remember when they asked the question at the debate where the Democrats were up there. You had all these Democrats, they started off with 26. And in fact, I said, “There’s no way they pick Kamala because she treated him worse than anybody else and her poll numbers were dropping like a rock, right. But they asked who is going to give money, healthcare to illegal aliens? And they all raised their hand. Remember Joe, he’s looking around. He didn’t understand the question. He didn’t. At least he has an excuse because has no clue what the hell they’re asking. But do you remember his position? He was like this. Their hands are all up. We’re going to give all our money away. Forget about all your people. That’s a big crowd by the way. Look at that. Show it. Show it please. Turn those cameras, please. That’s a beautiful crowd. That’s beautiful. But remember Joe, so he’s standing there. He’s going to give healthcare to illegal immigrants, people that come into the country illegally, in other words, right. They come in illegally and under a plan, they have the manifesto. They want to give them a lawyer. That’s what we need is more lawyers now, okay. They want to give them a lawyer. They want to give them education. They want to give them healthcare, but they asked the question and I said, “Wow,” because I think they had like 26 people originally, but every one of them raised their hand including Sleepy Joe. And what happened is Joe’s like this, everybody other hand, and Joe, you could se he’s… For 47 years, he’s got the itch because he knows this isn’t going to work. He’s saying to himself, because you know there’s still something left. Not much, but he’s saying to himself there’s a natural instinct, right, a political instinct. And his shoulder went up and then his hand so I don’t know. I don’t think I’m even going to hold it to him. I’m not going to hold him. I got enough. How about the no fracking? We will not frack. Do you understand me? We will not. Then he gets a nomination, goes to Pennsylvania where they are reliant on energy and fracking and the jobs, probably 900 to a million jobs, right. Goes there the day after he says he’s not fracking. He says, “We will frack. We will frack.” And they don’t hold it to him. If I ever did that, it would be the end, but never going to be the end for us either, is it? You know that. Never going to be the end because we have something going that nobody has ever had going. We have a relationship with the people that nobody’s ever had. Not because I do think I’m a nice guy. A lot of people, they say suburbia, the suburban. I’ve saved the suburbs. Okay, I’ve saved the suburbs. Then I heard I’m not doing well with suburban women, okay. I got rid of… No, it’s true. They say that. But of course they said that last election too. He will do terribly with women, terribly. And then when I did great with women, they said, “Man, he did well with women.” Same thing’s going to happen. You know what I find? Suburban women, period, they want security. They don’t want their home values going down. They don’t want a low-income housing project built in the middle of suburbia next to their house. And we have a rule that’s a disaster. It’s a regulation, and I said to Ben Carson, and some people, I say, “I want to terminate.” They looked at me. They go, “Well, we can amend it.” I said, “You don’t understand. I want to terminate it.” You all know about it. It’s a disaster where they change the zoning and they make it impossible and you end up with low-income housing all over the place. And remember this, 29 to 30% of the people living in suburbia are minorities. So this has nothing to do with discrimination. It has nothing to do with anything. What it has to do is with the American dream, the American dream. We’re not going to destroy the American dream for stupid people like Cory Booker. He was putting Corey Booker in charge. How about that one? That’s a beauty. Yeah. He did a great job as mayor of Newark, New Jersey. That worked out. How’s Newark doing? This election is a choice between Trump recovery at a level that nobody’s ever seen before and a Biden depression. If they get elected, they’re going to double and triple and quadruple your taxes. You will have a depression the likes of which this country has never seen before and that probably includes 1929, okay. And one thing we learned about the farmers, they don’t do well in depressions. Do we agree? They don’t do well. Nobody does well under depression. You will have problems like you’ve never had before. Joe Biden would terminate our recovery, delay the vaccine, prolonged the pandemic. And by the way for those states, open up your states. Open them up. Watch on November 4th. November 4th, all these Democrat governors that have locked downs, right. I always said, I said right at the beginning, I think it was me that came out first. They’ll try and say, “20 years ago somebody said the same thing,” but I said, “The cure cannot be worse than the problem itself.” And if you look at what’s happening with these lockdown to children, get the children back to school. I’ll give you an example. The children, 99.9%. Barron Trump, you know he had the Corona 19, the China virus. It’s got 21 different names. I could go over it, but to me Corona means Italy. China is China, and it came from China so he had the China virus, right. And he had it for such a short period of time. I don’t even think he knew he had it because they’re young and their immune systems are strong and they fight it off 99.9% and Barron is beautiful and he’s free. Thank my wife, our First Lady who loves Iowa by the way. Our first lady, she put out that Barron has tested positive. And I said, “Wow.” And we talked about it. I said, “You put it out.” It’s personal stuff, but we really have it. I said, “Yeah, let’s put it out.” Barron’s tested positive. Within like two seconds, it was Barron is just fine now. He’s tested negative, right. Because it happens. People have it and it goes. Get the kids back to school. We got to get the kids back to school. Get them back to school. All right. Get them back. Get them back. And when I had it, you might’ve read, maybe most of you don’t know this, but I had it too. I didn’t love it, but it’s a little tough and you have a temperature and you don’t feel good. And then the scarier part is where’s it going? It’s fine. You’re at a 101 or a 102 and then you say that, “I don’t love this.” You haven’t had a temperature in years and then all of a sudden you have it, but you see what happens to people. And I went to the hospital and it’s an incredible hospital, Walter Reed. I’ve seen what they’ve done because I’ve been there many times for our great warriors that come back so badly wounded. And these doctors are incredible. And one thing when you’re president, I’m laying in this bed, not feeling my best. And I’m surrounded by 12 doctors, one’s the head of Johns Hopkins, one’s the head of Walter Reed, one’s the head… These incredible doctors. And I looked at the alternatives, all things we developed in the last seven months, and one of them is Regeneron. And I said, “I’ll take that one because it is very early into testing, but it had great numbers.” And I’m telling you, they gave me this and they call it a therapeutic. To me, it’s a cure because I felt like Superman the following morning. I felt like… In fact, I made a speech about a day later, two days later. Somebody said he looks better now than he did two weeks ago. What the hell is going on? So this is what’s happening. We’re making tremendous progress. The vaccines are coming out very soon. A lot of great things are happening on that front, but a lot of great things are happening for our country. I’m working to make the antibody treatment that I received to… I want to give it to all of the people that qualify for it, people in hospitals, people just before they go to hospitals. It will clean out our hospitals. Eli Lilly makes a very similar drug and we’re going to do it free. We’re going to do it free. It’s not their fault. We’re going to do it free. So we’re in that process of getting an emergency, it’s called emergency use authorization. And we’re going to Regeneron and the Eli Lilly, a comparable drug, we’re going to give it to everybody. And I hope they have the kind of luck that I have, but maybe I would have been perfect anyway. I like to say, “I didn’t need it. I would have been perfect anyway because I’m so strong.” I said sarcastically, I said, “Well, I’m in no danger because I’m in perfect physical shape and I’m very young.” And CNN goes and reports President Trump lied to the American public. They said, “Can you believe this?” I was telling last night we had an incredible rally in Pennsylvania. Oh, they’re doing at CNN. I thought they were doing it to me, I said, “We don’t have too many of them anymore.” Do you ever notice? At the beginning when we started, we would always have the phony people that stand up and raise their voice, then go home to mom and get balled up. I don’t know. I shouldn’t be talking about this because all of a sudden we’ll have one, but we don’t have that anymore. I learned about the cameras because the cameras never like showing it. Look where that crowd goes to. Look where that crowd goes to, all the way back to the buildings. And I’m always telling I never thought the cameras could move. And then I just noticed whenever we had a troublemaker in the audience, they’d spin around. They’d be in a pretzel, right? They can do anything these guys. I thought they were rigid, like a rigid piece of steel. They don’t turn, but if we had in the back room behind the pillar somebody, that camera would be turned around like a snake 15 different angles. But that sounds good. That’s a brand new F35 fighter jet. You can’t see it. They say it’s the greatest plane in the world. And by the way, speaking of that, our military, when I came in the world’s most overrated general told me, “Sir, we have no ammunition because we may have had a conflict very early in.” And I said, “No president should ever hear that.”, And we have rebuilt our military $ 2.5 trillion all made in the USA with equipment like that, the likes of which no country has ever seen before. We are the envy of Russia and China and any other country. We have equipment that nobody has. Our missiles, our rockets, our nuclear has been totally upgraded and pray to God we never have to use it because I see what happens. Pray to God, but if we didn’t have that, we could be in very big trouble. It’s a very tough situation. But you look at the new tanks that we’ve ordered from Ohio, by the way. We kept the Lima, the Lima Plant. I said, “Keep it open.” They were going to close it. I said, “Keep it open.” Before I became president, I said, “Keep it open,” because I visited. I said, “You could never build a plant like this. You could never get the people to make the tanks and we’re going to be ordering tanks.” we’ve totally rebuilt our military. We have the greatest missiles, rockets, tags, fighters, bombers, tankers, ships in the world, all made in the USA. You can be proud of your country. Look at this young handsome, this young, handsome farmer. You’re going to be a farmer someday? You’re going to be a farmer? Huh? He goes, “Hell yeah.” I’d like to be a farmer too sometimes I’ll tell you. We’re joined tonight by some incredible friends and great people. Your governor, who’s done an incredible job, Kim Reynolds and Kevin, her husband. Where is Kevin? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Really great job, Kim. How are we doing by the way, okay? We’re looking good. That’s good. Thank you for everything Kim. As well as Lieutenant Governor Adam Greg. Adam, thank you. Thank you very much Adam. Great job. Iowa Secretary of Agriculture, Mike Naig. Mike, where’s Mike? Thank you, Mike. Iowas Senate Majority Leader, Jack Whitver. Thank you. See the way they all stay together. They like each other. Speaker of the Iowa House, oh, you got to tell me this. This is good genes I think, right. There are genes involved here, right. Pat Grassley, right. Good genes. What’s the relationship Pat? Huh? That’s good stuff. You got good stock. I want to bet on that guy in the future. Thank you very much. Great job. I hear you’re doing a great job. We’re doing all right? Good. Thank you Pat. Ambassador Terry Branstad. Okay, do we have time for one quick story about Branstad? Because his son, Eric is even better than him, but I’m not going to talk about it. And here’s the guy that doesn’t mind me saying.a lot of fathers, they get angry if you say that. Oh, I’m better than my son. Those are not great fathers. This guy’s proud. His son is great. But when I met Terry, it was long before I thought about this and I heard the Governor of Iowa was in New York and he wanted to see me. I said, “Oh, what the hell do I want to see the Governor of Iowa for?” I’m putting up buildings and I’m saying, “All right.” And I invited him before I ever thought about really doing this, early on at least. And he came up and a humble guy, great guy, handsome guy. That face, right. And he sat down and I figured I’d give him five minutes. Kim, no longer than that five. And I ended up spending an hour and a half. I said, “That is the smartest governor.” And then I learned, and as you know, he was the governor for 24 years. That’s an all time record in the United States, right. 24 years. And he told me a story in the first meeting. That was before I think that I was even thinking about doing this. And again, it’s only because Obama and Biden were so bad. I said, “Let me do it.” I wish I didn’t have to, but I’m having a lot of fun because we’re making such progress. But he told me a story. He said, “Many years ago I met a man in China because he was selling corn.” Can you believe it, right, corn crops. And he was selling corn. And he said to his wife, this is 35, 40 years ago. He said, “I met a man in China and I went home to my wife and I said, ‘I just met the next president of China many years forward, but I just met a future president of China.’ And I said, ‘Who was that?’ It was President Xi, who’s now the President of China.” And I said, “You got to be kidding.” He said, “Nope. I could tell right from the beginning he was different.” And I’m not happy with what’s going on, but he said, “I just met the next president.” And then I remembered that story and then I ran and he was so incredible to me and Iowa and he wanted us to win and his son was very much in charge of what we were doing and it worked out great and we won by a lot. And then we won the whole thing. And I said “We have to pick somebody really smart for China.” And I said, “The Governor of Iowa came to me and told me that story and I told him. I said, ‘How would you like to be ambassador to China?’ And he said, ‘Sir, I’ve been doing this for 24 years. It would be an honor.’ And I have to tell you this, he represented us great with China.” He represented us great. I never told that story. I never told that story, but about a month ago, he called and he said, “Sir, I want to come home now. I want to make sure you get reelected. I want to come home.” And he’s out there. I know he’s out there working, but we love him. He’s a special guy. We’ve got a couple of real beauties with Grassley and with this guy. I’ll tell you, what a couple of great people. Thank you very much for everything. Great job you did as ambassador. The only question I have is do we call you Mr. Ambassador or Mr. Governor? What do you like? He said, “Either one’s okay.” That’s him. Anyway, thank you very much. Great job. I want to introduce another one who’s one of the best, maybe the best in the whole country. He’s the chairman of the Iowa GOP, Jeff Kaufmann. You look good Jeff. You lost weight Jeff. You lost weight. I’m proud of you, Jeff. You do a great job. How are we doing? He said, “Iowa is ours.” Always be careful. He said, “Iowa is yours.” I say, “Never say that.” The last one, Beto, remember when he said that he was running for president. He was doing okay. And he was on the cover of a third grade magazine called Vanity Fair and he made the statement, “I was born to do this.” I said, “That’s the end of his political career.” He was born to do it. That didn’t work out. I hear we’re doing great. Thank you very much, Jeff. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Congressional candidate, a star, a guy who’s going to be fantastic, David Young. David, thank you. You got a lot of good candidates. We’re also joined by a very special guest, one of the greatest wrestlers in American history. You know that, right? He’s an unbelievable guy. I’ve known about him for a long time. Do we all love Jim Jordan, our Congressman, right? Jim Jordan. Jim Jordan is a great wrestler, a great NCAA champion. I know a lot of people don’t know that, but Jim, and Jim’s from Ohio, but he says the greatest of them all is a guy named Dan Gable. You ever hear of Dan Gable? And listen to this. I mean, I have to tell you, is Dan here? I hope he’s here. Come here Dave. Come on. Come on. Look at this. You mean I can’t take this guy in a fight? Can you believe it? Wow. Wow. [inaudible 00:20:32]. Hey Dan, I’m immune and I can’t give it to you so that’s good. We love you so. But I met Dan a few years ago and I looked at him and I said, “How come he’s 181-1. Think of it. He won 181. People don’t know that’s crazy. 181-1. I’m going to ask you later on who is the one? I want to find out who, but he did something else. He won the Olympics 1972. And to do that, he had to wrestle against the six greatest wrestlers in that weight class in the world. And he did something never done before. He didn’t yield one point throughout the whole thing and he ended up beating in the Olympic finals for the gold medal, he beat the great Russian wrestler. Didn’t get a point. He went through the whole thing. Nobody got a point and I’m looking at him and I’m saying to myself, “I’m telling you, I could take him, but I better not try.” But Dan has been inducted into the USA Wrestling Hall of Fame, the US Olympic Hall of Fame, the National Wrestling Hall of Fame, and the United World Wrestling Hall of Fame, and he’s become University of Iowa’s all time most winning coach. In fact, Jim Jordan said, He was as great a coach as he was a wrestler.” He won many. How many championships did you win as a coach Dan? 15. And I come from a town where you have the Jets, they never win. You have the Mets, they never win. We won 15. That’s called talent. It’s called extraordinary talent actually. And what I did is I thought about it. I thought about it long and hard. We’re very selective. So the Congressional Medal of Honor and the Presidential Medal of Freedom are the two greatest awards you can get in our country. And I’m proud to announce that I will be awarding very shortly at the White House in the Oval Office, Coach Gable the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Say something Joe. Great honor. Well, he’s the pride of Iowa and he’s great. You always try and figure out what makes a champion because you look at him. Nice guy, good looking guy, all that stuff, but why is he 181-1? Why is he a gold medalist that’s done something that nobody ever did? Didn’t allow one point of any of these wrestlers and they’re all the best of the world, the toughest, and it’s just something different and you’ll probably never figure it out. It is with great champions. You see it and you see it all the time with great champions, but there are very few. Jack Nicklaus you see it. Tiger got the same award. When Tiger won the Masters a few months ago, I said, “You know what, that’s an incredible thing he did.” And we gave him the Presidential Medal of Freedom and he said it’s one of the greatest honors. He actually said it’s his greatest honor. I said, “Tiger, you deserve it.” He went through a lot and he came back and… But you have great champions and they’re different and nobody knows why. That man is different and he’s a champion and it’s an honor to present you to the people that love you most, Iowa. Thank you. Thank you. Under my administration, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world, and now we’re doing it again. We’ve got a V-shape, we’re going to see some very big numbers and you’re seeing it. In my first three years, family income increased by $6,000. That’s more than five times the gains in all eight years under the last administration. African-American income grew nine times more than it did under Biden and Obama. We lifted 6.6 million Americans out of poverty. So proud of that. African-American unemployment, Hispanic American unemployment, and Asian American unemployment all reached the lowest levels in history. At the end of the last administration, the Congressional Budget Office projected fewer than 2 million jobs would be created over the next three years and we crushed that prediction and created almost 8 million jobs. Nobody can believe it and we’re doing it again. My policies have benefited those who needed it the most. The bottom 50% of households saw an astonishing 40% increase in net worth after our tax cuts, wages grew fastest for the nicest, I mean it makes me feel so good, blue collar workers. They were the ones that had the biggest benefit from what we did. Since the China virus, we have created a record 11.4 million jobs. That’s a record. We’ve never created jobs at a level at which we’re creating them now. We’ve already cut the unemployment rate in half, we’re down to 7.8%. Sounds high, but a lot of people said we’re going to be a 42%. We’re down to 7.8 and going down rapidly. Under Biden, it took 30 months to recover more than half of the jobs lost, 30 months. We did it in five months. Jobs have been recovering. Think of this. Jobs have been recovering 23 times faster than the Obama-Biden recovery. 23 times faster. Not 23%, 23 times faster. I’ve spent the last four years reversing the damage Joe Biden inflicted over the last 47 years. He supported NAFTA, a disaster. Now you have USMCA, it’s the best. It’s now kicked in. He supported TPP. Would have destroyed your farms, would have destroyed everything, and our auto industry would have been gone, and he supported China’s entry into the World Trade Organization, a catastrophe for our nation. China tries to get away with the fact that they are a developing nation. Not anymore. If Biden wins, China wins. That’s what’s going to happen. If Biden wins, China will own our country. They’ll own it. And if we win, Iowa wins, and America wins, and we’re going to win for a long time. For decades, our politicians spent trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign wars, and defending foreign borders. But now we are finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities, and we are bringing our jobs, our factories, and our troops back home to the USA where they belong. As I mentioned, one of the things that was very important to me was to eliminate the very unfair estate tax or death tax on small businesses and farms. Now, if you love your child and you’re a farmer and you think he’s doing a great job or she’s doing a great job, and she wants to keep the farm or he wants to keep the farm, there is no more estate tax where they have to go out and borrow a fortune to pay the tax. Is there anybody here who has a child to which they do not want to leave the farm because they don’t like their child? Raise your hand, please. Does anybody have the courage? There’s one person over there. He says he’s only kidding. No, but it’s a big thing. I mean, look, it’s a big thing. A lot of farms were put out of business. The parents, they pass away, they leave the farm to the son, the daughter, to the family, and the family has to go out and borrow a fortune and then they have a little bad season, a couple of bad seasons, and they end up losing everything. We don’t have that anymore. We cut the estate tax, it’s out, gone. These are things a lot of people don’t even know. We’ve got that. Along with the tax cuts, we got that. Biden wants to repeal our tax cuts and massively raised taxes on your family farms. And what we did was hit the, you know this, you know exactly, we hit it so quickly. We hit so hard. We hit so strong on this whole tax situation because the farmers were being treated unfairly. So unfairly with respect to taxes. I quickly issued a major disaster declaration and I will be with you every step of the way. I think Kim will say this, your governor, when you had floods all over the place, you were like a large scale swimming pool. I hate to say it, Iowa. I looked at the pictures that your governor sent. I said, “Kim, I never knew that this was ocean front property.” And we took care of you, right? We gave you everything you needed and we got rid of all of, we’ve rebuilt the dams and the dikes. Right? We rebuilt it and we rebuilt it fast. My opponent is foot forward, a radical plan to eliminate US borders by implementing catch and release, imposing deadly sanctuary cities and suspending all removals of illegal alien. So if you have somebody that’s a murderer or a rapist, we can’t do it. They agreed with Bernie Sanders, crazy Bernie. There’s nobody that knows how to lose like Bernie. Four years ago, he lost, he went home happy. He lost again because Pocahontas refused to get out of the race. Otherwise, I would have been running against Bernie. I don’t know which is better. There would have been a lot more enthusiasm for Bernie, smaller base, more enthusiasm, Bernie got, I’ll tell you. We’re going to get a lot of the Bernie voters because they don’t like Joe. And they love our policy on dealing with other nations because they love our policy on trade because they understand. They happen to understand that, but they also know we can do something about it. Bernie would have never been able to do that. The United States would be completely overrun in a matter of days. Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure border in US history and we are finishing the wall. It’s now over 400 miles long. It’s already built. And as I said, Mexico is paying for the wall. We did more, one of these fake reporters said it, we did more, one of the only politicians that’s ever run, forget about politician, but one of the only politicians ever run that actually has done more than he or she has promised. As an example, I campaigned a lot in Iowa. I never mentioned the word space force, but when I got into office, I realized I looked at Russia, I looked at Kim Jong-un, I looked at China. I said, “We need a space force,” and we got space force. I never talked about it on the campaign trail. We also passed VA choice for our great veterans and VA accountability, things that they said were impossible to get done. So now, instead of waiting online for weeks and weeks, if they have to wait, they go out to a doctor, we pay the bill and it’s been a great thing. 91% approval rating in the VA. They’re doing a great job over there. Think of it, I shouldn’t be telling you this because they’ll find a vet someplace who’s unhappy. But think of it, all our lives we used to see on the evening news horror shows with the vets and the vets and the vets, and it’s terrible what they’re doing. You don’t see any stories about the VA. You don’t see any stories. We have done 91% approval rating by the vets for the VA, the job we’re doing. And we defeated 100%. We’re bringing our soldiers home, but we defeated 100% of the ISIS caliphate in Syria and Iraq. And when I took over, it was a mess. And we killed the leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi. They were looking for him for years and years. And we then took out the world’s number one terrorist and the mass murderer of American troops and many other troops and many other people, Qasem Soleimani is dead. Dead. One of the biggest things to happen in the Middle East in 50 years. I withdrew from the last administration’s disastrous Iran nuclear catastrophe. $150 billion, $1.8 billion in cash for nothing. That deal’s practically expiring now anyway, if we didn’t terminate it. I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. And you know that presidents have been talking about that for decades. Every president said they were going to do that, then they never had the guts to do it. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, and that’s been 52 years they’ve been talking about that. I got it done in about two hours. And instead of endless war, we’re forging peace in the Middle East. So I get nominated for three Nobel Peace Prizes, different subjects. And I told the story the other night, I was in Florida or Pennsylvania, I told our First Lady, “Darling, we’re going to have the greatest publicity I’ve ever had tonight. I got nominated for the Nobel Prize. Do you know what that is, darling.” Let’s go home. So I leave for the first time in a long time, early. I get home, I turn on the television. They talked about your floods in Iowa. They talked about how’s Iowa doing with the crops. How’s this happening? How are they doing in Florida? Three, four stores, one after another, where’s my Nobel Peace Prize, they don’t talk about it. I said, “Darling, this news is a little tough. It’s a little tough to crack.” When Obama got his Nobel Prize, it was so early he didn’t even do anything. He still doesn’t know what he got at for. They said, “Why did you get it?” He said, “I have no idea.” And it was the biggest story, it was all over the place. With me, I got three and they got three dominations, nobody talks about it. So at least I figured I might as well mentioned it, right? Kim, I should mention it, right? Kevin. Right, Kevin? Kevin, stand up please, Kevin. There’s the guy. I went on a hunting trip. My son, Don, he loves hunting. And he went Kevin, Don and about 300 of the governors, your previous Terri, your previous governor’s friends. And they all went hunting and it was like 25 degrees below zero. The only two guys that stood out there the whole time were Kevin and Don Trump Jr. And they came back. Everyone else was back at about 15 minutes, Terry, right? There were all back and they wanted to go back into the lodge, the hell with this. And after a weekend, my son comes back and Kevin comes back and you two guys didn’t even know what they were talking about. You didn’t know what the problem was. Right? People don’t know that about Don and they don’t know that, but Kevin is fantastic. Thank you Kevin, for being here. Appreciate it. He’s a real guy. So I’m ending the old wars and Biden will lead us into new wars. And we did more in 47 months than Biden did in 47 years, and that’s a fact. And if you look at the Democrats, they’re pushing the most far left agenda ever put forward by a presidential nominee. Their plan would destroy your social security, destroy protections for pre-existing conditions. Biden vowed to terminate our travel bans on jihadist regions. I got the travel ban. Everyone said, “Oh, that’s not nice.” I said, “Really?” It’s not nice to come up and blow up cities either is it? We won on the United States Supreme Court and he wants to end it. And surge refugee admissions by 700%, meaning 700% opening the flood gates to radical Islamic terrorism. No thank you. No thank you, sleepy Joe. He’ll ban school choice and he’ll ban charter schools, very important places. Civil rights all starts with the education and we need school choice. In a second term, I will provide school choice to every parent in America. We’ve already started. We’ve already started. It’s an incredible thing because it’s great education for less money. It’s sort of a crazy thing. Less money, great education. And just to finish up, a vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs and a limitless future for all Americans. Over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we will end our reliance on China once and for all. It’s already happened. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults or law enforcement and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms, your Second Amendment. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens and we will keep America out of ridiculous, horrible, endless foreign wars. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might. We have never, ever been even close to as strong as we are right now, greatest equipment ever in our history. And we will ensure peace through strength. If you remember, when I ran, they said, “Oh, he’s a very militant kind of a guy. We’ll be in a war the first week.” Well, where’s the war? Where’s the war? And I’m making other countries pay because NATO, they weren’t paying their bills. They were delinquent to use the New York real estate term. They weren’t paying their bills. I said, “You got to pay.” The secretary general of NATO is my single biggest fan. They’re paying $130 billion a year more now because I said, “Look, you got to pay. You got to pay.” They rip us on trade and there was supposed to protect them, the European Union. So NATO, so they’re paying 130 billion more going to $410 billion more each year. So that’s it. Where are the wars? He’s going to get us into a war. Where are the wars? They don’t want any part of us. Nobody wants any part of us in the world. They were tired of being ripped off as a country. We will end surprise medical billing. The surprise medical billing is a disaster. It’s ending as of January 1st. Require price transparency, all signed, all done, January 1st. Can you imagine if I lose and I’ve done all these things? They kick in on January 1st. You’re going to say “Boy, that Biden’s done a great job on price transparency.” And they’ll say, “What are you thinking? He has no idea what the hell it is.” And further reduce the cost of prescription drugs. We went through a favorite nations clause so that we will pay the lowest drug prices in the world. Okay? We will strongly protect Medicare and social security and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. And when I took over, NASA was basically closed. It was shredded, it was nothing. And now it’s the number one preeminent space center, anywhere in the world by far. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education through our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. We will live by the timeless words of our national motto, in God we trust, and it won’t change. For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of Iowa. Get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your workers and coworkers and get the hell out to vote because if I don’t get Iowa, I won’t believe that one. I may never have to come back here again if I don’t get Iowa. I’ll never be back. You understand that Kim? I will say this. There has never been a president has done more for farmers and ranchers. For the farm belt, for Iowa, there’s never been a president that’s even come close to what I’ve done. And I will say that and I’ll say it louder and clearer. I’ll say that loud and clear. From Cambridge to Council Bluffs, from Cedar Rapids to Rock Rapids, from Davenport to right here in Des Moines, we stand on the shoulders of Iowa patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for this beloved nation. We inherit the legacy of American heroes. Just nobody has anything more than what you have so much. Look at yourselves and look where you’ve come. Look even in the world of politics, Iowa, it’s Iowa. And by the way, as long as I’m here, Iowa, and I made this pledge to you four years ago, Iowa will always come first in the rotation. You know what that means, right? There’s a lot of pressure. Let’s put them back. I said, “No, you’re not putting them back.” You know why? Because that’s called the opposite of cancel culture. That’s called a great American tradition. Iowa will always be number one. Okay? You can forget it. We inherit the legacy of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blaze the trails, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, laid down the railroads, dug out the Panama Canal, raised up the skyscrapers, won two World Wars, defeated fascism and communism, and landed our brave American astronauts on the face of the moon. So much you’ve done. We made America into the single greatest nation in the history of the world and the best is yet to come. Proud citizens like you helped build this country. And together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. Because we are one movement, we are one people in one family. We are one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of Iowa, we have made America wealthy again. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again. We will make America safe again and we will make America great again. Thank you Iowa. Thank you. Thank you very much.

"86","10-15-20","I’m feeling great, I don’t know about you. How is everyone feeling? It’s great to be back in my home state, Florida, to make my official return to the campaign trail. My goal is to fight for you and fight for your family. That was very well stated, I have to say. Good job. Thank you, thank you. Nothing whatsoever, I’m great, I feel good. I was in North Carolina today and did a big rally with tremendous turnout, and I just feel really good. Florida, Pennsylvania, were- They said, “Let’s go to the hospital.” I said, “That’s okay. I’m going to respond to what you say.” And we went over to Walter Reed, where you have tremendous professionals. They gave me Regeneron and Remdeceiver both. And all I know is I felt good the following day, I felt really good. No, but they said the lungs are a little bit different, a little bit perhaps infected, and-I don’t know. I mean, I didn’t do too much asking. I really felt good. I didn’t have much of a problem with the lungs. I did have a little bit of a temperature. Obviously, I felt there was something missing, and then I tested, I tested positive. Yeah, and there shouldn't be. Well, I test quite a bit, and I can tell you that before the debate, which I thought it was a very good debate, and I felt fantastically, I had no problems before. I don’t know, I don’t even remember. I test all the time. But I can tell you this, after the debate, I guess a day or so, I think it was Thursday evening, maybe even late Thursday evening, I tested positive. That’s when I first found out about it. Yeah. I had no problem. Again, the doctors do it. I don’t ask them. I test all the time. And they-If you ask as the doctor, they’ll give you a perfect answer. But they take a test and I leave and I go about my business. I probably did, and I took a test the day before and the day before, and I was always in great shape, and I was in great shape for the debate. And it was only after the debate, a period of time after the debate that I said, “That’s interesting.” And they took a test and it tested positive. No. No, but I take a lot of tests. Possibly I did, possibly I didn’t. But the doctor has very accurate information and it’s not only that doctor, it’s many doctors. The one thing, if you’re President, you have a lot of doctors you’re surrounded by. But I was in great shape for the debate. And sometime after the debate, I tested positive, then that’s when they decided to, let’s go. Well, they do a lot of testing in the White House, they test everybody including me, but they test everybody. And something happened. But as far as the mask is concerned, I’m good with masks. I’m okay with masks. I tell people, wear a mask. But just the other day, they came out with a statement that 85% of the people that wear masks catch it. So this is a very-That’s what I heard, and that’s what I saw. And regardless, but everybody’s tested and they’re tested often. And I also knew that, hey, I’m President. I have to see people. I can’t be in a basement. I can’t be in a room. I can’t be… I have to be out. I can, but people with masks are catching it all the time. I mean, if you look at the Governor of Virginia, he was known for a mask. If you look at Thom Tillis, a great guy, he always had a mask, and they caught it. Yeah. Yes, I know this. Well, I mean, he has to say that. I think it’s great, he’s a friend of mine. He’s a good guy. And wrong or not wrong, you have to understand, as President, I can’t be locked in a room someplace for the next year and just stay and do nothing. And every time I go into a crowd, I was with the parents of our fallen heroes. These people are the most incredible people. And they came up to me and they would hug me, and they would touch me, and I’m not to not let them do it, to be honest with you. There was, exactly right. We had a gold star event with the most incredible people you’ve ever seen. And I could have chosen not to talk to them, or to keep everybody away. And you know what? I don’t think that’s probably where it was caught, but maybe it was. No, I don’t know where it came from, and you don’t know where it came from, and the doctors don’t know where it came from. But as the President, I have to be out there. I also know-I know this. I mean, let’s see, Kamala. She’s got people now, people have it, and I’m not blaming her. I’m not saying, “Oh, she did a terrible thing.” As President, I have to be out there. I can’t be in a basement. I can’t be locked in a very beautiful room someplace in the White House. And I want to see the gold star families, and I want to see everybody. And I also say to people all the time, it’s risky doing it. It is risky doing it. But many people are catching it. Many people are getting this disease that was sent to us by China, and it shouldn’t have been allowed to happen. But many people are getting this. And I mean, nobody’s being blamed. Everybody is working hard to get this thing out of our country, get it out of the world. Look at what’s going on in Europe, massive spikes. They’ve done a very good job, but now you take a look today at the UK, you take a look at Spain and France and Italy. There’s tremendous spikes. Well, I have thing right here that will tell you exactly the opposite. The UK is up 2500%, because I knew you’d be doing this. I know you very well. The UK is up 2500%. The EU is up 722%. And the United States is down 21%. Excess mortality. Excess mortality, we’re a winner on the excess mortality. And what we’ve done has been amazing. And we have done an amazing job. And it’s rounding the corner and we have the vaccines coming, and we have the therapies coming. And I’ll tell you what, one thing. When I got it, I had a choice. Do nothing, or use some of the things that we’re looking at, like in this case, Regeneron. and Eli Lilly makes something that’s supposed to be incredible. And I think that maybe I wouldn’t be doing this discussion with you right now. We have therapies now and cures, maybe you can use the word cure, but we have therapies that are absolutely incredible, Savannah. I believe we're rounding the corner, yes. Right, right. That's right. Yeah. The cure can not be worse than the problem itself. We did the right thing. We were expected to lose 2,200,000 people, and maybe more than that. We’re at 210,000 people. One person is too much, it should have never happened because of China. It happened because of China. And you have to get that and understand that. But it shouldn’t have happened. But we were expected to lose, if you look at the original charts from original doctors who are respected by everybody, 2,200,00 people. We saved 2 million people. I don’t know, let me tell you what is happening. I left North Carolina, which I love. I left Pennsylvania. We won a big case in Michigan because that governor has a lockdown where nobody but her husband can do anything. He can go boating and do whatever he wants, but nobody else can. The fact is we’re winning all these cases because it’s unconstitutional what they’re doing. And I think they’re doing it for political reasons. But the fact is the cure, you can’t let this continue to go on with the lockdowns. And I believe that on November 4th, you’re going to have a lot of these governors. Look at what’s happening to New York. New York is a mess. They lost almost 40,000 people. They have a lockdown like you’ve never seen. Now they’re open, it’s like a ghost town. And Savannah, it’s very important. People are leaving New York by the thousands, and you’re going to have a hard time ever building it up again. So that cure, that so called cure that you talk about, it can’t be worse than the problem. The problem is a bad problem. Okay, fine. Oh, you always do this. No, you always do this. You've done this to me, and everybody-I denounce white supremacy. Okay? I’ve denounced white supremacy, for years, but you always do it. You always start off with the question. You didn’t ask Joe Biden, whether or not he denounces Antifa. I watched him on the same basic show with Lester Holt, and he was asking questions like Biden was a child. So, are you ready? Are you… Wait. Are you listening? I denounce white supremacy. What's your next question? Hesitant? Here we go again. Every time… In fact, my people came, “I’m sure they’ll ask you the white supremacy question.” I denounce white supremacy. And frankly, you want to know something? I denounce Antifa, and I denounce these people on the left that are burning down our cities, that are run by Democrats who don’t know what they’re doing-So, I know. Yeah. I know nothing about QAnon. I know very little. You told me, but what you tell me, doesn’t necessarily make it fact. I hate to say that. I know nothing about it. I do know they are very much against pedophilia. They fight it very hard. But I know nothing about it. If you’d like me to-study the subject. I’ll tell you what I do know about. I know about Antifa, and I know about the radical left, and I know how violent they are and how vicious they are. And I know how they are burning down cities run by Democrats, not run by Republicans. He may be right. Can I be honest? He may be right. I just don't know about QAnon. I don't know. No, I don't know. You tell me all about it. Let’s waste the whole show. You start off with white supremacy. I denounce it. You start off with something else. Let’s go. Keep asking me these questions. But let me just-let me just tell you. What I do hear about it, is they are very strongly against pedophilia. And I agree with that. I mean, I do agree with that-and I agree with it very strongly. I have no idea. I know nothing about them. No, I don't know that. And neither do you, know that. Why aren’t you asking me about Antifa? Why aren’t you asking me about the radical left? Why aren’t you asking Joe Biden questions about, why doesn’t he condemn Antifa? Why does he say it doesn’t exist? Antifa, no, excuse me. That’s so cute. Antifa exists. They’re vicious, they’re violent. They kill people, and they’re burning down our cities. And they happen to be radical left. I know nothing about it, can I-That was a retweet. That was an opinion of somebody-and that was a retweet. I’ll put it out there. People can decide for themselves. I don’t take a position. No, no. No, no. That was a retweet. And I do a lot of retweets. And frankly, because the media is so fake, and so corrupt, if I didn’t have social media… I don’t call it Twitter, I call it social media. I wouldn’t be able to get the word out. And the word is-and you know what the word is? The word is very simple. We’re building our country, stronger and better than it’s ever been before. And that's what's happening. And everybody knows it. You know what else the word is? We're winning in a lot of states. We're winning in a lot of states. You're going to see that. Sure, they can. And do you know what? Win or lose, that’s the way I want it to be. But when I see thousands of ballots, right? Unsolicited ballots, being given out by the millions, and thousands of them are dumped in dumpsters. And when you see ballots with the name Trump, military ballots, from our great military. And they’re dumped in garbage cans-No, no, it's happening every day. Oh, really? Well, then he’s not doing a very good job. All you have to do is pick up the papers every day. 50,000 in Ohio, the great state of Ohio. 50,000 in another location, I think North Carolina. 500,000 applications in Virginia. No, no, there’s a tremendous problem. But let me just tell you, they talk about the peaceful transfer, right? They spied on my campaign and they got caught. And they spied heavily, on my campaign. And they tried to take down a duly elected sitting president. And then, they talk about, “Will you accept a peaceful transfer?” And the answer is, yes, I will. But I want it to be an honest election. And so does everybody else. When I see thousands of ballots dumped in a garbage can, and they happen to have my name on it? I’m not happy about that. Could I ask you, how can you say that? How can you say that? You do read newspapers? You do watch the news? I know you read the news, but do you watch it? Because, every day, they’re talking about ballots that are corrupt, that are fraudulent. Sure. Sure, sure. But you can win a race… Take a look at me. You can win a race by 1%. I'm not, I don't want that to happen. You know what? I don’t want that to happen. Savannah. I want it to be clean. And I want… I really feel we’re going to win, but I want this to be clean. But it’s sort of ironic that you, and them, talk about the peaceful transfer when I spent three and a half years fighting off these maniacs. And now, it turns out, everything’s there. That they were the ones that dealt with Russia, and it’s too bad. Peaceful transfer, I absolutely want that. But ideally, I don’t want to transfer, because I want to win. Sure. How are you? Thank you very much, it's beautiful. As what? Well, I did put it in very early, as you know, Joe Biden was two months behind me, and he called me xenophobic and racist and everything else, because I put it in. And it turned out that I was 100% right. I also put it on Europe, very early, because I saw there was a lot of infection in Europe. And it’s sort of an amazing question. And I appreciate the question, and respect the question, but the news doesn’t get out the right answer. Because I put on a travel ban far earlier than Dr. Fauci thought it was necessary. Who I like. Far earlier than the scientists… I was actually the only one that wanted to put it on. And I did it, actually against the advice of a lot of people, including Nancy Pelosi who had no clue what she was doing. And, Biden. When I put on the travel ban… You know, I put it on in January. The end of January. When I put on the travel ban Joe Biden, and others, said, “This is ridiculous. You don’t do that.” Well, Dr. Fauci said, I saved thousands and thousands of lives. I was early, I was extremely early, when I put on the travel ban. I read that, but no, he didn't. I read it… I read it, someplace. Maybe Woodward said it, or something. But no, he did not say that. But, I knew it was a big threat. At the same time, I don’t want to panic this country. I don’t want to go out and say, “Everybody’s going to die. Everybody’s going to-” Okay? No, there's not a middle ground. No, no. No. There’s not a middle ground. You have to be safe. You have to be vigilant, and you have to be smart. Okay. Good. We'll talk you out of it. Miami. Right. Right. Right. So, it’s happening. We just set a record, 11.4 million jobs. We are going to have a phenomenal third quarter, which will be announced on November 1st, just prior to the big November 3rd day, where I think you’re going to see a red wave. But we’re going to have a tremendous announcement. I believe. I mean, we’re going to find out, but GDP is going through the roof. Jobs, real estate, houses. So many things are happening. So, people were saying, we’re going to have a 42% unemployment. Look, this was a thing that came into our country and it happened a hundred, more than a hundred years ago, and it happened now. They were talking about a 42% unemployment rate. It came out, it just came out-at 7.8% unemployment, and people can’t even believe it. Our economy is going to be… Next year, if we don’t have somebody that raises taxes and quadruples taxes, which they want to do, and it kills everything. Our economy is going to be phenomenal, next year. We’re going to have a phenomenal…And, I’ll tell you, Savannah. We had the greatest economy in the history of our country last year, including the state of Florida, where we are now. In Pennsylvania, in North Carolina, in Ohio, every place. We had the greatest economy we ever had. We had to close it down, we saved two million lives. We’re opening it up. We have a V-shape and it’s coming back. It’s coming back very fast. One other thing, we really helped the hospitals. We’ve sent billions and billions of dollars to the hospitals. In addition, hundreds of millions of masks and gowns. And we went into the ventilator business, because this country was not equipped with ventilators. And I’m not blaming anybody for it. But we’re now making thousands of ventilators a month, and we have all we can use. We’re sending them all over the world, because the world needs them. So, they’ve worked very hard and really very, very effectively. Thank you. Great question. No, because I was okay with the masks. I was good with it, but I’ve heard many different stories on masks. I had, being president, you have people, they bring meals, they bring this, they… And I had an instance recently, where a very wonderful person is bringing me a meal, and he’s playing with his mask. And he’s touching his mask, all over the place. And then he’s bringing a plate in, and I’m saying, “Well, I don’t know if that’s so good.” I mean, the good news, I didn’t eat it. Okay? I decided not to eat it. This was a month ago. But I… Look, look, you have, on the masks, you have two stories. You have a story where they want, a story where they don’t want. I am all for it. Some. No. No, the-And then, you have other people that disagree. Scott Atkins, if you look at Scott, Dr. Scott. He’s from, great guy, Stanford. He will tell you that, he disagrees with you. Oh, I don’t know. Look, he’s an expert. He’s one of the great experts of the world. I'm all for it. By the way-I never said, ""Don't wear them."" Savannah, University of Washington. And then, you have other places, say different things. You have a lot of… Hey. Dr. Fauci said, “Don’t wear a mask,” right? Oh, I don’t know. Then he changed his mind. But then, you have a report coming out two days ago, that 85% of the people wearing masks catch it. Savannah. We’re on the same side. I say, wear the mask. I’m fine with it. I have no problem. We're on the same side. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Good. So we got rid of the individual mandate on Obamacare, which was the worst part of Obamacare, and now you could actually say it’s not Obamacare because that’s how big it was, where you had to pay a fortune for the privilege of not having to pay for bad health insurance, so we got rid of that. That was a big, big thing. And by doing that, and we will always have… By the way, we’re always protecting people with pre-existing conditions, and I can’t say that more strongly, but we’ve been able to bring healthcare costs way down. Now, I took over Obamacare, got rid of the individual mandate, made it good, managed it much better. Remember, they had the $5 billion website disaster, and all of the problems they had. The problem with Obamacare, it’s not good. We’d like to terminate it, and we want a much less expensive healthcare that’s a much better healthcare, and that’s where we’re aiming. And if we can do that, and we have a very good chance of doing it, but we’ve also brought down the price of Obamacare. The problem with Obamacare, it basically is never going to be great, and I want to give great healthcare. So important. And thank you very much. It is a big issue for me too. That's right. That's right. In order to replace it with a much better healthcare at a much lower price. And always, under all circumstances, we are going to protect the Republicans. And maybe I changed the party a lot over the last three years, but we will protect people with preexisting conditions. And Savannah, what I want to do, get rid of the terrible Obamacare. I’ve already done it to a large extent because as you know, the individual mandate is gone. That was the worst part. No, no. We have done-That’s right. I’m sorry, but if you look, we had both houses and what did we do? We got rid of the individual mandate. That went through the legislature. Look, look. We should be on the same side. I wanted very simple. I’m going to put it very simple. We would like to terminate it, and we would like to replace it with something that’s much less expensive and much better. We will always protect people with preexisting conditions. And here's the thing-If we don’t succeed, we are running the remnants of whatever’s left because we took it apart. We are running the remnants of whatever’s left much better than the previous administration, which ran it very badly, but we’d like to have new healthcare much better and much less expensive. Well, we’ve actually passed three packages, and we’re on our fourth, and I agree with him 100%. He should vote for me. The problem you have is Nancy Pelosi. She couldn’t care less about the worker. She couldn’t care less about our people. And we should have a stimulus, and I want a stimulus. The Republicans will approve a stimulus. The problem is she doesn’t want to do it because she thinks it’s bad for her election. The fact is, she’s wrong because people know she’s in our way, she’s not approving it, she doesn’t appreciate our people, and she doesn’t appreciate, at all, our workers. Nancy Pelosi, we are ready to sign and pass stimulus, but she’s got to approve it. That's right. That’s right. Did you ever hear a word called negotiation when negotiating? Okay. I’m negotiating-You know what? And you know who I’m negotiating against? Nancy Pelosi, because she doesn’t want to give them money. We should have stimulus. This was not our people’s fault. This was China’s fault. And she’s penalizing our people. I’m ready to sign a big, beautiful stimulus. You saw the other day, I said, “Go big or go home.” Right? I want it to be big. I want it to be bold. I want the money to go to directly to the people. They’ll go. Yeah, they’ll go. They’ll go. They’re going be very active-I know, because I haven’t asked them to because I can’t get through Nancy Pelosi. If Nancy Pelosi and I, through my representatives or directly, I don’t care, if we agree to something, the Republicans will agree to it. How are you? Nice to see you. Thank you. It’s a great question. We’ve created more jobs than this country has ever created. We were up to 160 million jobs. We were never even close to that number. We were just hitting 160 million jobs, companies are pouring into our nation because of the tax rate, and if Biden comes in and raises taxes on everybody, including middle income taxes, which he wants to do, you will blow this thing, and you’ll end up with a depression, the likes of which you’ve never had. That’s what’s going to happen. We have something that’s really good. The reason we’re coming back so strong is because we built a very strong foundation. Companies are moving in. Car companies are moving into Michigan, into Ohio, into South Carolina, and North Carolina just today, so what’s happening is, they’re coming in because we reduced the taxes. Our taxes, our corporate taxes were the highest in the world, and now they’re among the lower taxes. They’re not the lowest, but they’re among the lowest. And what that means, is jobs, but also we’re doing a very big, and we’ve done a very big, middle income tax package. So if we get in, we’re going to do the middle income tax package, but it’s a great question. And if he comes along and raises rates, all those companies that are coming in, they will leave the U.S. so fast your head will spin. We can’t let that happen. Thank you. Okay, first of all, let me answer. What they did is illegal, number one. Also, the numbers are all wrong, with the numbers they released. And just so you understand, when you have a lot of real estate, I have real estate, you know a lot of it. Okay? Right down the road, Doral, big stuff, great stuff. When I decided to run, I’m very underlevered, fortunately, but I’m very underlevered. I have a very, very small percentage of debt compared. In fact, some of it, I did as favors to institutions that wanted to loan me money. $400 million compared to the assets that I have, all of these great properties all over the world, and frankly, The Bank of America building in San Francisco. I don’t love what’s happening to San Francisco. 1290 Avenue of the Americas, one of the biggest office buildings. What I'm saying is that, it's a tiny percentage of my net worth. And you’ll see that soon because we’re doing things. We’ve given, I think it’s 108 or 112 pages of financial detail to elections, and we have to file as the president, as any politician, you have to file. Nobody ever looks at that. When they do, they see how incredible a company is, but more importantly, they see where this debt is. No, I don’t owe Russia money. I owe a very, very small… It’s called mortgages. People have a house, they put a mortgage. Not that I know of, but I will probably, because it’s so easy to solve, and if you’d like to do, I will let you know who I owe, whatever small amount of money. I want to say two things. Number one, it’s a very small amount of money. Number two, it’s very straight. It’s very, very straight, but it’s a tiny percentage of the worth. Did you ever hear the expression underlevered? I am extremely underlevered. As you know, I'm under audit. It turned out that I am under audit. But they actually-Excuse me. No, no. But you accused me of not being under audit previously. And so did other people at NBC. And I am under audit. So that one’s solved. That’s good. I am under audit. No person in their right mind would release, prior to working out the deal with the IRS. And I’ll go a step further. I’m treated very badly by the IRS. They treat me very, very badly. You have people in there from previous administrations that treat me very badly, but we’re under audit. It’s very routine, in many ways, but we’re under audit. They like to change the game, change the rules, do everything. You saw what they did with the tea party people. You saw what they did with the religious group. No, except common sense, and intelligence, and having lawyers that say… Because I would love to release them, and as soon as we come to a conclusion, I will release them, and very gladly, but if you go to elections, and if you take a look, you’ll see 112, I think it’s 112, it talks about the income, which is rather massive. It talks about all of the properties. They have them listed. You can never learn more, but you know what happened? People went there. All the reporters went. There was a feeding frenzy. This was originally, when I filed it. And I filed it every year. I update it every year. My son is here. They run the company. I don’t run the company. Yeah, because that's a statutory number. It's a statutory. I think it's a filing number. You pay 750, it's a filing or a filing fee. No, I don’t know. I can tell you this. If they have my tax returns, as you know, they have to go to jail. It’s illegal, but their numbers were wrong, but let me tell you what else. I don’t owe money to any of these sinister people. This has been going on for years now. Russia, Russia, Russia. It turned out to be a hoax, and it turned out to be that Hillary Clinton and the Democrats were dealing with Russia, not me. It’s a whole hoax. So I would not mind at all saying who it is, but it’s a very small… When you look at vast properties like I have, and they’re big, and they’re beautiful, and they’re well located. When you look at that, the amount of money, $400 million is a peanut. It’s extremely underlevered. And it’s levered with normal banks. Not a big deal. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Adam. So when I was elected, and when a president is elected, they’re elected for a period of four years. And Justice Ginsburg said it best. I think, talking about president Obama having to do with somebody else, that the president is put there for four years, not for three years. So during this fourth year, it happened to come up, unfortunately, because I had great respect for Justice Ginsburg. But a vacancy happened to come up, and we picked somebody that’s outstanding. She has been an absolute star, and I’m extremely proud of it. But again, plenty of time. There’s plenty of time. We’re going to do it before the election, but we also have much time after the election. But there’s no reason to wait, because it’s almost unanimous, it seems to me, certainly within the Republican party. And frankly, most of the Democrats within closed rooms, I guarantee you that. This is an outstanding person, and I’m using my fourth term. And if you look at it and if you put the shoe on the other foot, if they had this, they would do it 100%. So there’s been 29 times when this has happened. All 29 times a president has done exactly what I’ve done. So I have a lot of respect, by the way, for-I have a lot of respect for Judge Garland. I want to tell you that. But I’ll tell you, the whole ball game changed when I saw the way they treated Justice Kavanaugh. I have never seen any human being, and I’m not just talking about Supreme Court… I have never seen a human being treated so badly with false accusations and everything else. I have never seen anything like it. And you know what the truth is, Savannah? Like it or not, the ball game changed a lot. There has never been anybody treated so badly as, now Justice Kavanaugh. Well, I think she’ll have to make that decision. I don’t think she has any conflict at all. A Supreme Court judge does not have… They can make their own decision. They actually have additional power to make that decision. It would be totally up to her. I would think that she would be able to rule either for me or against me, being I don’t see any conflict whatsoever. We have an election coming up. I think it’s the most important election in the history of our country. If for any chance, and it probably won’t… And I hope it doesn’t ever get to the Supreme Court. But if it did, I would think that she would rule one way or the other. I would think so. I have no idea. Because believe it or not, I never asked her about it. I never talked about it. I didn’t talk about any of the obvious things that you could talk about. And I think a lot of people in my position might. But in speaking to a lot of very brilliant people and people that do this for a living, they say it’s better not to talk. So I talked to her about life. I talked to her about the fact, “Would you like to do this? Are you willing to do this?” Because it’s a tremendous burden. The answer was, “Yes.” She’s unbelievably well-qualified, but I never spoke to her about these various questions. Thank you very much. Well, again, I’m not ruling on this. And Roe v. Wade is something that a lot of people would say, obviously, you’re going to speak to somebody. Also two other great Justices, Justice Gorsuch, and Justice Kavanaugh… I never spoke to them about Roe v. Wade. I never spoke to them about election laws. I never spoke to them about anything. And I’ve done the right thing from a moral standpoint. I don’t even know from a legal standpoint, but it was the right thing. I think, depending on what happens with Roe v. Wade, I think that perhaps it could get sent down to the states, and the states would decide. I also think perhaps nothing will happen. I have not talked to her about it. I think it would be inappropriate to talk to her about it. And some people would say, “You can talk to about it.” I just think it would be inappropriate. I would like to see a brilliant jurist, a brilliant person who has done this in great depth and has actually skirted this issue for a long time, make a decision. And that’s why I chose her. I think that she’s going to make a great decision. I did not tell her what decision to make. And I think it would be inappropriate to say right now, because I don’t want to do anything to influence her. I want her to get approved, and then I want her to go by the law. And I know she’s going to make a great decision for our country, along with the other two people I put there. Many of them would. Perhaps most of them would. I am telling you, I don’t want to do anything to influence anything right now. I don’t want to go out tomorrow and say, “Oh, he’s trying to give her a signal.” Because I didn’t speak to her about it. I’ve done the right thing in so doing. How she’s going to rule, you’re going to find out perhaps. Or you might not find out. It may never get there. It may never get there. We’ll see what happens. Hi, Cindy. Thank you. Thank you very much. Right. I fully understand the question, and I saw everything that you saw over the summer. And it was a terrible thing, a terrible thing to watch. We have a Senator named Tim Scott from South Carolina. He came up with a bill that should have been approved. It was great. It was a bill that was strong in terms of law enforcement, and strong in terms of enforcing the proper thing, and doing the proper thing by law enforcement. And the Democrats just wouldn’t go for it. They wouldn’t go for it at all. And I don’t know why, because it was a really great bill. But I do have to say this. And some people don’t like it when I say it, but a lot of people agree. I have done more for the African American community than any president. With the exception of Abraham Lincoln. Criminal justice reform, prison reform, historically Black colleges and universities. I got them funded. They were on a year to year basis. They could have been put out of business. As soon as our country had a little bad year, they would have said, “I’m sorry, we’re not going to fund you.” I got them 10 year funding and financing. And more than they even asked for. I became very friendly with a lot of the heads. But we’ve done more… And of course, opportunity zones. But criminal justice reform, everybody said it could not be done. President Obama and Biden never even tried to do it. They never even tried. But I say that, and I say it often. I’ll say it loud, and I’m very proud of it. And I have a great relationship because of what I’ve done with the African-American community. I’m very proud of it. Thank you. Thank you very much. Got you. Thank you. Right. Yeah. DACA is somewhat different than Dreamers. You understand that, and you understand it better than anybody, probably, in this room. Where do you come from, by the way, originally? Where? That’s very good. Okay. So we are going to take care of DACA. We’re going to take care of Dreamer. It’s working right now. We’re negotiating different aspects of immigration and immigration law. We’ve built now, over 400 miles of border wall, southern border. Mexico is working very closely with us. We have the strongest border we’ve ever had. We want people to come into our country. They have to come in legally. But we are working very hard on the DACA program. And you will be, I think, very happy over the course of the next year. Because I feel the same way as you do about it. Thank you. Thank you very much. Well, what happens is because of the pandemic, much changed on the immigration front. Mexico is heavily infected, as you know. And we’ve made it very, very difficult to come in because of the pandemic, and other reasons, and crime. But we have a very strong border right now, and we have to keep it that way. But we want people to come into our country, but they have to come in through a merit system, and they have to come in legally. And people are very, very happy with it. You haven’t heard any complaints about that. But what happened is because of the pandemic, we have to be extra cautious. It’s very happy. The fact is, we got rid of catch and release, which is a disaster. You catch somebody. They could be a murderer. That could be a rapist, and we’re supposed to release them into our country. These are the laws that I inherited. We ended that program. Now, I think you’re going to see something very, very good. The whole immigration… If you look at what’s going on, people used to pour into our country. And especially during the pandemic, I think even you, Savannah, will be very impressed with what we’ve done. Sure. That's right. Because I’ve done a great job. We have the strongest economy in the world. We closed it up. We are coming around the corner. The vaccines are coming out soon, and our economy is strong. We are at a level with jobs like we’ve never been before. We’ve rebuilt our military. We’ve rebuilt our borders. We had no borders. We had no nothing. We’ve rebuilt so much. We’ve given you the greatest tax cut in the history of our country. Greatest regulation cut, equally as important. And we created new levels of jobs that nobody thought was possible. And next year is going to be better than ever before. Thank you very much.

"87","10-16-20","I love Georgia. I love being with you. This is Georgia. This is Macon, Georgia. We won Macon, Georgia. We’re going to win it again. It’s great to be back in the heart of this incredible state with the thousands of loyal, hardworking, unbelievable American patriots. Thank you very much. In 18 days from now, we’re going to win the state of Georgia. We’re going to win four more years in that beautiful and incredible in so many ways… That beautiful white house, right? And just remember, early voting is underway. Get out and vote, go out and vote. So we’re running against perhaps the worst candidate in the history of presidential politics. Can you believe this? Did you watch last night? I mean, give me a break. But actually I wish he was a good candidate because it actually puts more pressure on you running against a guy like this. Sleepy Joe Biden is the living embodiment of the corrupt political class that enriched himself while draining the economic life and soul from our country. You know what’s happened. You know very well in Georgia, what happened. For the last 47 years, Joe Biden, he shipped away your jobs, shut down your factories, threw open your borders and ravaged our cities while sacrificing American blood and treasure in endless and ridiculous foreign wars. In places you’ve never even heard of before. How ridiculous. He’s a servant of the wealthy donors, globalists and special interests who got rich bleeding America dry. And by the way, I could call these guys. Every one of them would give me millions. I’m President. I called heads of Wall Street firms. I’d say, “Hey, do me a favor. Could you give me 5 million every single day?” I can’t do that though, because you know what? If I do that, I got to do things for them. And I don’t want to do… I want to do what’s right. I could call… I could raise more money. I’d be the world’s greatest fundraiser, but I just don’t want to do it because then they call you and your son and say, “Hey. They treated me good. I got to treat them good.” I know you don’t think that’s the way the system works, but that’s the way the system, I guess, works, unfortunately. But it doesn’t work that way for me. In 2016, you voted to fire this corrupt and decrepit political establishment and you elected an outsider as president to finally put America first. And we’ve learned over the last couple of months, Joe Biden is a corrupt politician. He’s a corrupt politician. And the Biden family is a criminal enterprise. Frankly, it makes crooked Hillary Clinton look like an amateur. Now whoever saw anything like this? He goes to China. The kid is followed like a vacuum cleaner. He follows and follows of follows. And unfortunately it sounds like he left his laptop behind, or they have thousands...This is the guy didn’t have a job, but now he’s taking in millions and plenty of it goes to Joe Biden, too. Don’t kid yourself. It goes to Joe… But did you see the one today? The guy gets 10%. 10%. I wonder who the guy is. This was not a good between Anthony Wiener’s laptop and this laptop. These are two beauties. I think this one could be worse than the Wiener laptop. Yet, this massive scandal is being covered up by the media and big tech, right? All those people, look at them. So here we have… Think of it. Here we have the biggest scandal going on anywhere in the world, the corruption of Joe Biden and the Biden family. And he’s interviewed last night by Stephanopoulos and ABC. And they don’t even ask him the question about it. No, no. Think of it. They don’t even ask him a question. Like, ” How come your son got three and a half million dollars from Moscow?” Right From Moscow, Russia. Because they were the ones involved with Russia, it turns out. Not me. It was the opposite. But why did you son get three and a half million from the wife of the mayor of Moscow? Think of it. Think of it. A little question like that. Remember Chris Wallace said, “Oh, well you shouldn’t ask him that question.” Why not? Why is that, Chris? Tell me. He’s no Mike. He’s no Mike. Chris is no Mike. But then the other one. How about this? A billion dollars, get rid of the prosecutor. Otherwise you don’t get the billion dollars from the United States, but that’s turning out to be peanuts compared to what we’re finding now. Now he wants $10 million from China to make an introduction. Would anybody here take 10 million to introduce somebody to your father? I’d do it, Dad. I’d do it for 10 million bucks. I’d love to introduce… I would do it, Pop, and he’d want me to do it. 10 million, Dad, please? I had a great father. I’m not just running against Biden and that corrupt family. I’m running against the left wing corrupt media. And we’re running against big tech. This is a hell of a big crowd. Look at it. It goes all the way back there. But the media, they never show it. You ever notice? You go home. They show me and about three people behind me. People left, right. Four stars. They end up three plus one. I love that. But no politician, I believe, has ever heard that chant. Really. We love somebody. No, think of it. Reagan. I love Reagan. He was a wonderful guy. You never heard the chant, “We love Reagan.” You never heard that. This started a few weeks ago and it’s amazing. And I appreciate it very much. I do. I appreciate it. And I love this state. I love Georgia. When you had the hurricane overdrive, where it came in and wiped out a lot of your area… David Purdue, who is a fantastic guy who may be here someplace, but David Purdue called me. He said, “You got to do me a favor. You got to help us with our farmers.” And we gave them a hell of a lot of money. They got wiped out by a hurricane. You don’t hit too many hurricanes, right? But this was a big monster that hit Florida, hit a lot of different areas. Hit Alabama. We took care of Alabama. We took care of Georgia. We took care of Georgia. Took care of our farmers. I’ll never forget. I stood. I came here and I stood and I was with 32 farmers. All of them got hit hard. And one of them said, “Sir, I was a week away from having the best crop I’ve ever had. And it got ripped apart. Just ripped apart.” It wasn’t his fault. And we took care of him. We took care of all of them. Okay? That made me feel good. It made me feel good. Great people. And they never asked for anything. They just want a level playing field. That’s all they ever wanted. And I raised, by the way, 28 billion. Thank you China, because they targeted our farmers. 12 billion and then the next year, $16 billion. Frankly, you did better without even working, if you want to know the truth. Came from China and we did a hell of a job and those farmers are all happy today, but they were targeted by China. We got $28 billion in tariffs and we gave it to your farmers and everybody’s doing just fine today, right? But the radical left is doing everything in their power to protect their chosen candidate, who has no clue where he is. He’s gone. They have nothing but disdain for you and for your values and the values of Georgia. I know Georgia very well. They flood your communities with criminal aliens, with drugs, crime, while leaving behind. And you see what they do. They live in gated communities, but they flood you out. They complain about guns and they complain about everything. And then they want to end your second amendment, but they want protection for themselves. They oppose school choice while sending their families to the best private schools. We need school choice, by the way. They demonize our great… And you see this… Hello. Look how beautiful. So beautiful. They demonize our great police and law enforcement while hiring private security for themselves. They attack the second amendment every single day while employing armed guards. And let me tell you, I am the only thing standing in the way of you and your second amendment. It’s under siege. That’s a big deal. They support crippling lock downs while their jobs remain totally exempt. It’s time we sent a message to these wealthy, liberal hypocrites. I could have every one of them. By the way, I mean, just like I said before I know these guys. I could call them all. “Hey, do me a favor. Irving, send me 5 million.” “Okay. I’ll do it. Donald, I’ll do it, if you want it.” Oh man, I got to do it. Do you mind if I take one week and just do it? I will set the all time record on fundraising. Man, would I be good at that. It’s so easy. I wouldn’t have to explain a thing. But they come from Washington. They come from New York. They come from Silicon Valley. And by the way, those Silicon Valley guys are sort of getting caught, aren’t they? Huh? Section 230. I’m sure most of you don’t know what that means. Section 230. These guys, they’re given powers. They’re given rights by Washington. And then they claim free speech, right? They claim… But no, but they’re given an exemption. They’re given a total exemption and they can’t abuse that power. And there’s a lot of things going on right now. And a lot of your people are looking. We have some of those people here, your great congressmen senators, and we’ll be introducing them in a second. But they’re looking very hard at section 230. On election day. You can send a message that the fake news media, right there. Boy, there are a lot of them. Look at that. It looks like the Academy awards. It’s a lot of people. There are a lot of people. Look at those cameras that are all running with us red lights. But every time I mention their name, those red lights go off. The red lights… That means you’re live. And then I start talking about him. They say, “Get the light off.” Turn it off. Go to a break. Let’s go to a break right now.” And fake news, CNN, they don’t know what they are. So fake. They really are. They’re just disgusting. NBC is no better. Did you get to see last night? They did a good job. But look, I mean, I could have had somebody else, they’re all the same. I mean, they ask you a question. You give them an answer, right? But I want to tell you that she’s disappeared. Everybody thought it was so inappropriate. Here they give this guy softballs. Did you see a week ago, Lester Holt? Lester Holt. Another genius. Lester Holt. “Here, Mr. Vice-President, sir, what did you have for dinner, sir? Was it good?” And in Savannah, [inaudible 00:15:42] faced the anger, the craziness. I mean, the craziness last night. And I said, goodbye. I said, “Great job, Savannah. You did wonderfully. Good job.” But we got very high marks for that last night. But they thought it was very unfair that Sleepy Joe who cannot answer a question… He really can’t answer a question. Well, Chris Wallace protected him with me. I talked about the Moscow three-and-a-half million payment. I talked about the billion dollars. Chris Wallace wouldn’t let that… He said, “No, that’s not appropriate.” Why? You mean the guy’s allowed to take three and a half a million bucks and we’re not allowed to talk to him about it? I’m telling you, that Biden family… And others, but that Biden family is corrupt. It’s a corrupt family. And with me and my kids… Let me tell you, my kids… I’ll tell you something. Lock them up. You should lock them up. Lock up the Bidens. Lock up Hillary. Lock them up. Can you imagine if my kids did what this guy Hunter’s doing? Ivanka… Ah, my beautiful, my wonderful Ivanka. She’s a good kid. Can you imagine? And she’s much smarter, much sharper. She could, if she wanted to. Oh, could she do well. And Don and Eric and Tiffany, they’re good kids. But we don’t do things. Boy, they’d make a fortune. Just think of it. And when you look at what they get away with… And by the way, Biden’s brother, try that one. I won’t go too deep in the family. I’m not looking to insult everybody. But honestly, in my opinion, it’s a criminal enterprise. It’s a criminal enterprise. He’s like a vacuum cleaner. The father goes through and the son comes in, a vacuum. Cleaner millions of dollars pouring in. And take a look at the way they live. 47 years, he’s a politician. He lives very well. Almost as well as Maxine Waters. You ever see her house? Maxine. Maxine Waters. What a beautiful house she lives in. I wonder how that happened. On election day, you can send a message that the fake news media can’t get away with any longer. We can’t let them get away with it any longer. And these big tech companies… It’s funny because I’ve heard about the big tech companies. I didn’t care too much. And I heard the power was unbelievable. And it’s 99% for the other side. And I kept hearing about big tech, the power, the power, the power. I ran. I kept hearing it. What the hell? In one ear, out the other. But I kept hearing and we won. So I kept hearing after that. We won. And I said, “Well, wait a minute. If they’re so powerful, how come we won?” Right. They were 100% against us. But now it’s gotten worse and worse. And now they’ve gone crazy. They’ve gone crazy. How about our magnificent Kaylee? Right? So Kaylee…I don’t know what the word would be. I guess, suspended, but they suspended her account because she posted an article from the New York Post, which is one of the largest papers in the country… Which by the way, I want to thank them. The one paper… They’ve really got guts. They’re printing this stuff. They got to be making a fortune, as much as they can make in that industry nowadays. But when you look at the failing New York Times and the Washington Post, they don’t want to write about it. They don’t want to write. This is the biggest political scandal. No, I’m sorry. It’s the second biggest political scandal. The biggest political scandal, we caught them. That’s when they spied on our campaign and tried to take down your President. But this is the second biggest political scandal. These are a bunch of bad people. And you think it’s fun doing what I do, right? No. I had a great life. I want to tell you. I was doing well. I was having a lot of fun, but you know what? I would never give up what we’ve achieved. Think of what we’ve achieved. I mean, honestly, there are a lot of successful people. There are a lot of people, their success. We’ve got a lot of them right here. A lot of successful people, but nobody in first three and a half years… Nobody. First three and a half years, nobody has achieved the history of our country what we’ve achieved with our military, with our tax cuts, with our regulation cuts. With all of the things that we’ve done, nobody has done as much as we’ve done. Things like Right To Try, things like Space Force. Thank you very much. No, I always get them. I said, “Turn the cameras. Turn the cameras.” So we just left Florida. We had a crowd that was like this. It was massive. It went on forever. I said, “Turn the cameras, show the crowd.” They don’t realize it’s actually good for them because it’s exciting. It’s like being at a Florida state, Florida, Ohio State, if you want to say. It’s a massive football game. Before we had to socially distance, we have all these empty seats. Right? You’ll be back very soon. You’ll be back very soon. And then of course, Georgia. Not bad. You’re doing okay. And who’s the greatest of them all from Georgia? Who’s the greatest of them all from Georgia? Herschel. Herschel. By the way, how good was Herschel Walker? Right? He made a lot of quarterbacks look good. Here, Herschel. Run it. Ball. Six yards, nine yards, 10 yards, 100 yards. And he’s on our side and he’s an incredible guy. Herschel Walker. I remember when he was playing here. They had the ballad. The ballad to Herschel Walker. He was just a legendary guy. Remember? From the time he started. Just boom, six yards, eight yards, 10 yards. And then the quarterback goes, he says, “I think I’m going to sign with the NFL.” It’s amazing. But Hershel’s been great. And Herschel loves his state and the fact that we have his endorsement so strongly, I mean, so strongly, we love it. But what a great football player, he was. What a great winner. We want to thank Herschel. The ballad to Herschel Walker. On November 3rd, show the people, the great American people that we’re charge, that we’re delivering Sleepy Joe Biden and that whole group of radical left crazies. And by the way, he’s not really radical left, but he’s got no choice. He’s got absolutely nothing going. They’re running the party. How about Kamala? Kamala? How good did Mike Pence do? So how good did Mike Pence do a week ago against Kamala? That was easy. Mike is great. He’s doing a great job. And he really did. He did a great job, but it’s very unfair. It’s so unfair when you watch… Okay. You watch last night and you see the anger and the hatred. I’m saying, “Well, look, let’s just do this thing. Just take it easy. Relax. Just relax. Take it nice and easy. Okay? Okay?” She said, “But I told you it true.” I said, “I don’t believe you. Why would I believe you?” You see that, where she’s screaming? I said, “Well, who told me?” “I told you.” I said, “Who cares if you told me. What are you telling me?” But we got very high marks. But compare that. Could you imagine if Joe Biden was treated like Savannah Guthrie treated us? Not me. It’s us. Could you imagine? He would be freaked out? He would probably be under the table. He would be under the table. And she’s easy compared to president Xi and Putin and Kim Jong-Un and plenty of others. She’s easy pickings. But could you imagine if she came at him? Did you see? Now, I was interviewed a couple of weeks back by George Stephanopoulos and it was a tough interview, but it was fine. I don’t say, “Give me the answers of the questions.” Do you ever see where they ask him a question and then he starts reading the… That means he has the answers to… I’d never saw anything like what’s going on in my entire life. They ask, “Did you see that a week ago where he said, “Move it up a little close. I can’t read the damn answer.” This is the fake news. I’ve been saying it. I am so proud of the fact that I’ve exposed these people for what they are. I’m telling you. Look at all that equipment. It’s millions of dollars worth of equipment. And you know what? If they were truthful, our country would come together so fast. It’s really true. They’re a big part of the problem. I was saying today, I was telling… When I was in Florida, I was telling the story that, our people, we’re going to bring it all together. And they said, “How are you going to do it through success?” Because we were ready. We had the most successful economy we’ve ever had. We never had an economy… African American, Hispanic American, Asian American, women, people with high school diplomas, people without high school diplomas, people from MIT, top of their class, geniuses, physicists, chemical engineers, everybody was doing better than they’ve ever done. And then we had the plague sent to us by China. We’re not going to forget that. We’re not going to forget that. We’re not going to forget it. And they know we’re not going to forget it. They know it damn well that we’re not going to forget it. And now we closed it down, we saved millions of lives. They don’t say that. We’re over 200,000, that’s terrible. But compared to other nations, it’s amazing what we’ve been able to do. But we saved millions. It was supposed to be 2.2 million lives, right? And we saved millions of lives. And now we’re rebuilding it back and our economy is setting records. What we’re doing is setting records. But if I don’t sound like a typical Washington politician it’s because I’m not a politician. And if I don’t always play by the rules of the Washington establishment and it would make… It would make my life a lot easier, to be honest. I know how to play those rules. Remember, they used to say, and I used to play the game about acting presidential. I’m a smart guy, we’re a lot of smart people here. I’m smart. And I always said, “It’s much easier to be presidential than to do what I do.” Right? Remember? And I said, “I’m more presidential if I wanted to be, but I got to get things done. I don’t have enough time. There’s so many stupid things that happened with bad deals, stupid deals, bad trade deal. But do you remember, I used to go and I would have fun, but I’d used to go and I’d imitate a president who’s playing presidential, that’s so easy compared to what we do, what we do is much more difficult. I said, “I can be more presidential than any president in our history with a possible exception of Abraham Lincoln when he wore the hat. That was tough beat.” That was tough to bit. But you remember, we had fun with it, we’d say, “Ladies and gentlemen of Georgia, this is your president. And it is a great honor to be with you tonight. Things are going very well with our country. Our military is building.” So I could do that and within about three minutes, everybody would pick up and they say, Let’s get that loud here. This guy is…” Now we’re doing a great job. We’re renegotiating these horrible trade deals. We’re bringing up people back home. Our soldiers are great heroes, because I was elected to fight for you, and I fight harder for you than any president has ever fought for the people of this country. Thank you very much. Thank you. By the way, I have to tell you, the spirit in this country is unbelievable, but the spirit in these rallies are unbelievable. And Hey, we are in Minnesota, we’re going to win Minnesota. Minnesota, I think hasn’t been one since 1972, we’re going to win Minnesota. We’re going to Minnesota. Opened up the INR. We opened up areas of Minnesota that they closed in. In Maine, Obama took away 5,000 square miles of ocean. Can you believe it? I gave it back to the people of Maine. We’re doing things that nobody’s ever thought about doing, ever done. We went into you… take a look at Minneapolis, the place was burning down. The national guard goes in 30 minutes. Would you say, remember they formed that beautiful scene after watching this for a week and a half. And we want to do it with Portland. Portland would be so easy. Wise, guys. They’re just wise guys. These are wise guys in there. You had the one who killed somebody in the street, took them three days to arrest. I sent in the US marshals, 15 minutes later, it was over. I said, “Why hasn’t that guy been…” They all knew who, they were putting this picture up. I said, “Why hasn’t he been arrested?: Well, sir, they haven’t…” I said, “Really you got another day.” We sent him the US marshals in 15 minutes, we had the greatest law enforcement people in the world. 15 minutes later, it was all over for him. But the forces opposing me in Washington, are the same people who are responsible for every disastrous trade deal, foreign policy, blunder and border security betrayal. Look at our border, our Southern border is so great. By the way, we’ve topped 400 miles of wall. Building 10 miles a week it’ll be finished very soon, but it’s had an incredible impact. Our border has never been as good. We got rid of catch and release all this stuff that everybody said would be impossible, but it’s been incredible. And Mexico is paying for the wall, you do know that, okay? They like to say, “Now finally, okay, he’s building the wall. But Mexico is not paying for it.” No. Mexico is paying for it. They know that, but they don’t like to say it. We’re doing some incredible things. This is the most important election in the history of our country. And I used to even, two, three months ago, say, “Well, this is like very important, but 2016 was important.” This is more important. Success will bring us together as I was saying, but you know what else is going to bring us together? A victory, because they’re just going to finally say, “Let’s just give up.” They’re going to say, “These people can’t be beaten. They’re going to say, “These people can’t be beaten. And many of them were so happy. Two weeks ago, “They heard Trump tested positive,” they were so happy. And then I got out, right away here I am, like a long time I could have done. They said, “Can you imagine he won’t be able to hold any more rallies? He’ll be recovering or worse. He’ll be recovering or worse.” And 12 minutes later, here we are. Don’t forget I’ve been doing this for a long time, this is not my first rally, right? But all these rallies are like this. The spirit of this country is unbelievable, and that’s what we have. And even the fake news admits we have more enthusiasm than any candidate in the history of this county. True. And he has less enthusiasm in my opinion than any candidate. I think he’s the weakest candidate in the history of presidential politics. I really mean it. Now with all of that being said, they have a corrupt media, they have big tech, they have all of this stuff, it’s a very powerful party. And they have advantages. They automatically win New York. I don’t know why New York is doing so badly. They automatically win California. I don’t know why, California is doing so badly, the forest fires, no water, no this, no that, minor little problems. They automatically, win Illinois. I mean, we got to run the table. It’s automatic because it’s just the way it falls. Winning the electoral college is a very, very hard thing to do. And we just ran the string. Right? But it’s a very hard thing to do. But we’re winning in Florida. We’re winning here. It’s amazing. If he came here, sleepy Joe, if he came here, honestly, if they announced, he’d work really hard to try and find people. Now, I really mean this. We have tens of thousands… This thing goes back way, way back. I wish they wouldn’t give these guys a good… I wish they’d moved them back a hundred yards. And I’m telling my people, I’ll save a little time, “My people please from now on, could you please move the fake news media back, another hundred yards?” I hope you’re listening too. Now because you know what, those cameras they have magnifiers on, they can be back and you can get a lot of people. So instead of standing behind the camera and looking at the camera man’s ass, we don’t need that, okay. Just move them back and we get more people up here because it goes back forever. Thank you back there. We love you. Thank you. But we’re going to move it back. Move them back. This can only happen in Georgia. I have an idea. You just gave me an idea. We’ll have a new T-shirt tomorrow morning, “Move Them Back.” Well, we did it with his crazy Hunter, Hunter Biden. Remember? Where’s Hunter. I kept saying, “Where the hell is Hunter,” because he was gone, they caught him stealing a lot of money, so he disappeared. Remember? And we, I said, “Where’s Hunter.” And then I said, “Wait a minute. That’s a great idea for a T-shirt.” We came out with a T-shirt, “Where’s Hunter.” It became one of the big successes of the year. Where’s Hunter. We were talking today about drug prices. And in this country we have a very bad system and we have middlemen that are very rich. And I was talking about how we’re cutting out the middleman or these are not people that like me very much. And we’re going with favored nations and all that stuff. We’re getting your drug prices down 60%, 70%, 80%. But the middleman and making all of this money tremendous, they’re very wealthy. They don’t even do anything frankly. At least the drug companies, they make the drug, so we’re talking about the middlemen. And I said, “Wait a minute, I think I know one of the middlemen, it must be Hunter. Hunter Biden is a middleman.” On top of everything else, China, Ukraine, Russia, plus he’s a middleman. What a family. Biden’s made a corrupt bargain in exchange… And that’s what he’s done. It’s a corrupt bargain in exchange for his party’s nomination, which by the way, should have gone to Bernie. Elizabeth Warren Pocahontas, if she would have left a day before super Tuesday, Joe Biden would not have won any of those States. They split up the vote. It was super liberal, her and it was crazy Bernie. And I say it all the time, I think Bernie Sanders is the nicest, greatest loser I’ve ever seen because… No, it’s true, and I mean this. We’re going to get a lot of their votes because they love us on trade because the one thing Bernie is right on is, every country in his world, including our so-called allies… Excuse me. Are there any children in the house? Okay close your ears. Children, screws us on trade. And Bernie’s people know that, and Bernie’s into it. The problem is, Bernie, wouldn’t be able to do anything about it. I’ve done a lot about it. I’ve done a lot about it. But that’s why we got a big percentage of Bernie people. And because they didn’t like Hillary, but they don’t like Joe. And we’re going to get a lot of Bernie people, so I have to be nice to Bernie, but I consider him a really good loser because he loses with such…. he’s so nice about it. He loses. I mean, what she did to him was bad, but this was in a way worse, because all Elizabeth Warren had to do is, leave the campaign. Didn’t even have to endorse him, and he would have gotten votes and he would have won every single state on super Tuesday, and that didn’t happen. And so now we have a guy with a little bit larger base, but no energy. Here, we would have had somebody with a smaller base, but with tremendous energy, but not as much energy as we do. And we have a big base. So I like that. A long complex story, but what the hell? I have nothing but time. Right? What the hell. In exchange for his party’s nomination, is a handed control. And you know that, in exchange to the socialists and the Marxists and the far-left lunatics, if he wins, the radical-left will be running this country. They’re addicted to power, and God help our country if that happens. I really mean it. You’ll never make a comeback. It’ll be a large scale version of Venezuela. I’ve been saying that for a year, but I’ve never meant it like I made it now. The only difference is the size because the ideology is the same. Venezuela 20 years ago or less, was so wealthy. One of the wealthiest countries, it had oil, it had everything, very, very magnificent. Now they don’t have water. They don’t have medicine. They don’t have food. Everyone’s fleeing the country. The only difference is the size. But the ideology...When you look at Portland, I want them to let us in. I said, “Governor of Oregon, let us come in. I want to solve your problem.” But they’re radical left Democrats, it’s just like the craziest thing, but that’s what Venezuela is. They’re anarchists. You look at some of these cities, they’re anarchists and they don’t want to say, and the press wants to call them peaceful protests. And we originally had a hard time. We had a hard time. They didn’t want us to have any rallies in certain States. And then I realized you’re not allowed to go to church. You’re not allowed to have dinner with people. You’re not allowed to do anything. Unless in Michigan, you happen to be married to the governor because her husband… You’re not allowed to go sailing unless you’re married to the governor of Michigan, in which case you can go sailing. Remember that? Did she get caught or what? Now she’s blaming me because people were whatever… I don’t know what’s going on. I don’t know. And it was our people that caught them. Right? It’s Trump’s fault. Always Trump’s fault. Isn’t it incredible. And yet we did her a favor. Who knows? I mean, they’d have to look at that whole thing too, but we are doing an incredible job in this country. This country is great. And we have spirit like nobody’s had spirit and there’s going to be a red wave next week. It’s going to be unbelievable. And they are talking about it. Look at them. It’s millions of dollars worth of equipment. And they’ll never turn it around to show those people back there because they want to say, ” Donald Trump had a rally in Georgia. There was a smattering of people, a small smattering.” No, it’s amazing. Nobody’s ever had what we’ve had, and you’re going to have a red wave. They call it a red wave. One of these characters standing right there. He said, “It could be a red wave, and don’t say, there could be, there will be. It’s going to be a wave.” And they don’t want to the phony unsolicited ballot. They send ballots out by the millions. They don’t have no idea, well, they do actually have an idea where they’re going, that’s what really… But we say, “Who’s sending them, where are they going, who’s getting them, who’s delivering them, who’s signing them.” What the hell are they doing? And if you say that they go, ‘He’s not for freedom. He’s not for freedom.” And they know better than you do. It’s a big con job. So we have to be very, very careful with the ballots because they find ballots in a garbage can last week. Military ballots, it had the name Trump on them, and they were in a garbage can. They found 50,000 ballots from Ohio. They find them from North Carolina dumped in a river. They find them, I think, 500,000 ballots in Virginia. They were incorrect. They’re printing them wrong. They had one little problem on one set of ballots, thousands and thousands, thousands. They forgot to put the name of Donald Trump on the ballot. Other than that, the ballot was quite good. No, this is serious. And I’m being serious about this. These people are doing a tremendous disservice and they using COVID as the reason. They’re using this as a reason, not to go out and vote. So we voted in world war one, where by the way, you had a pandemic that made this look like peanuts, okay? World war one. They voted in world War II, they voted in world War II, they voted during the Great Depression, they’ve voted, voted, voted. But we can’t do that, you got to send in a ballot, so complicated too. They have instructions, you do the ballot, then you do this. But some of them make it nice and simple. You don’t have to sign. You don’t have to verify. But what they don’t tell you is we’ve won a lot of court cases. How about, you put your ballot in, and it has to be in by November 3rd, but you have two weeks in which… So wait a minute, you have two weeks to count them. Does that mean we have to hold up the whole election, because you know what I want to find out who won or lost. I want to find out, legitimately, who won or lost on November 3rd. I’m not looking to find out on November 19th or on December 1st or on two years from now. And if you take a look at some of these ballot schemes… In New York, we had one of, third great politician named, Carolyn Maloney, who I know very well. She used to come to my office all the time for campaign contributions, but you want to race, the number of ballots missing. They have no idea. Her opponent who could have won, it was very close, but they declared let her the winner. But her opponent has gone totally nuts. And you know what he should. He should. But you look at that. You look at Patterson, New Jersey, you look at what happened in Virginia, these are all races that took place recently. And I must say, even in 18, they had a lot of disasters, and even in 16. I didn’t even know it, but they had a lot of ballots. I promise you, it will be against us, okay. It will be against us. It will be against us. But you look at Nevada, we have a good chance to win Nevada, but they’re sending ballots to everybody. And the governor was a backroom politician, and I don’t want him having the fate of an election. I don’t think it’s right that he has the fate of our most important election ever in his hands, I don’t want that. So if you see anything wrong law, enforcement’s watching, us marshals are watching, the same type of guys. These are no games people. One thing I would say law enforcement they’re on our side. And I have said it. I said it during the debate with Joe. I said, “Joe, name one law enforcement group that’s supporting you.” He couldn’t do it. And then he was bailed out by Chris Wallace. I said, “Name one law enforcement.” Then I said, “Hey Joe, just say the words, law and order. Say those words, Joe,” he didn’t want to say it. I said, “Joe, just say the words, law and order. And that’s not hard, Joe law and order.” He couldn’t say it. He wouldn’t say it. Then he tried, I think he said, law and order and safety and security, because he has to get the vote of the radical left and they don’t like law and order. And you know who likes Trump, because of law and order, the suburban women, who’ve I keep hearing, because they want law and order, and I got… Oh, look at that. Thank you. Same thing happened four years ago. Same thing They said, “Women will not vote for Trump. Women will not,” then the election’s over they said, “Man, the women really came out and voted for Trump, right? Suburban women. I keep saying suburban women, and I got rid of a regulation that would have destroyed the value of your homes. Okay. And would have made your homes very unsafe with low-income housing being built all over the place right next to your house. I terminated it. And even my people, they said, “Sir, you don’t have to terminate it, we can make it much weaker.” I said, “No. No, you don’t understand. I want it terminated. Terminated.” And I terminated it. Suburban women, please. Thank you very much. Okay. I heard, they like my policy, but they don’t like my personality. I said, “They don’t care about my personality. They want to be safe and they want to keep their American dream. They don’t care about it, which I think is okay. They like my personality. I like them. I like them. I love them. The radical left is hell bent on destroying everything that we love and cherish, it’s that culture stuff. Cancel culture. They want cancel culture. They want to get rid of our great heroes from the past. They want to get rid of our history. They want to get rid of our culture. I was at Mount Rushmore. They want to blow a Mount Rushmore up. I said to our great governor of South Dakota Christie, I said, “Christie it’s never happening Christie. Don’t worry about it.” She said, ” We don’t even need your help on this one.” It was so beautiful Mount Rushmore, but they want to blow it up. I said, “Not going to happen. None of that stuff is going to happen.” But I will tell you a few months ago, if I weren’t your president, you would have had the Jefferson Memorial, the Lincoln Memorial… How about Lincoln, they want to attack even Lincoln. He’s probably looking down and he’s saying, “What the hell did I do. I was on their side, I think. What did I do?” They want to attack the Lincoln. If I wasn’t your president, they would have attacked the Jefferson Memorial. And I stopped it. I stopped a lot of things. I also saved your second amendment, by the way. They want to punish the middle-class, expunge every last trace of traditional values and replace the American dream with a socialist nightmare. The Democrat party has gone crazy, but they have contempt for America. They have contempt for the United States. And I don’t think Biden does, but Biden has no power. He’s gone. He’s gone. Up here, he’s gone. The Republican party is proud of America. We’re proud of America. We love America. We celebrate American values, American history and American culture. And we’re working to deliver a truly extraordinary American future. But I want the Republican party to get tougher, because the Republican party, they’re very good people, but they’re not tough enough in terms of our values or what we stand for. They let these other people, these lunatics get away with things like, you can’t spy on a campaign, you can try and take over a duly elected president of the United States and get caught. And when you get caught, you have to suffer the consequences. It’s very simple. Joe Biden and the Democrats socialists, will kill your jobs, dismantle your police departments. And you see that going all over with Seattle and all. And by the way, Seattle, so they knew we were going in the following day. The night before they raised their hands and they left. Okay, very simple, I said, “That’s it? Whether they like us in there or not we’re going. And they took over a big piece of the city and they weren’t going to do anything. They knew we were going in. And so the night before they said… these are little facts that I give you… Just to give you because that’s the way it works. They’re supposed to ask us, the governors are supposed to ask us, but these radical left… if you look at Republican run States and cities, they’re doing phenomenally well, never done better. But if you look at these radical left, look at what happened to my beautiful New York. Since I left, three and a half years, it was doing great. And I left. I’m not saying because, but maybe it is. But I left, I came to Washington. What’s happened to New York, what they’ve done to that incredible city and State is so sad. Look at Chicago, look at what’s going on there. Look at what’s going on at Atlanta. Look at Atlanta, it’s so sad what’s going on. And these are radical left, no bail, no cash bail, no nothing. I mean you kill somebody, no problem. No problem. They’re going to have to get their act together. They’re going to have to get their act together because we’re not going to put up with it much longer. They want to dissolve your borders, released criminal alliant, raise your taxes, and by the way, I’m cutting your taxes big. Biden this guy wants to substantially raise your taxes. And then he says, “Well, I’m only talking about people…” I said, “No, no, no. He wants to terminate the tax cuts that we gave you,” so that’s 2000. And then you look at the energy cuts and you look at the child tax credit… it’s a thousand dollars each. And you look at… It’s $7000, $8,000, $9,000 a family. Well, if you’re going to terminate it, that means it’s $9,000. “Well, I don’t know about that,” then he pulls out a piece of paper and he starts reading it out of his… Did you see that? He did that yesterday. They pulled out a piece of paper because he couldn’t remember any of the numbers, and George Stephanopoulos, is sitting there watching this. He didn’t treat me as nice. So I did him two weeks ago too. And he was okay. He was fine. It is what it is. He’s going to ask me a question. You know the expression, “He asks you a question, I give him an answer.” That’s all you can do, you can’t do any better than that. But they were nasty, pretty nasty and not terrible, but pretty nasty. Last night she was out of line, I mean, in my opinion. She was out of line. And it’s like as I said, “Just relax, take it nice and easy.” But when you watch the one the week before, it’s such a difference. The beauty is, the people of our country get it. They’re smart, they get it. They get it. They get it better than NBC on by Comcast CON. I’d call it, Con Cast. It used to be calm. They spend a fortune on public relations and I come along and call them Con Cast all the time. It’s a con job. They want to confiscate your guns, drive God from the public square and abolish the suburbs. That’s what they want to do. To defend our constitution from this badness, I proudly nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett, to the united states Supreme court. She’s great. She’s so smart. She’s so smart. She’s done a great job. She’s done a great job. And she went through it, with no problem. And they came at her, they came at her. It was like your Atlanta team when they were good a couple of years ago. How the hell did they lose that Super Bowl? Could you … How the hell did that happen? I keep thinking, man, if you own that team or you worked for that team, that was a long shot. But it’s one of those things. But that was like that team playing a high school football team, right? She was so much more talented than those people that were trying to embarrass her. And she was cool as hell. The coolest was, “Do you have notes? Do you have notes?” What? A blank. She doesn’t need to write down notes. I don’t have notes either, right? Most of this has been off this teleprompter because if was on the teleprompter, many of you would say, this is a little boring let’s get out of here, Sam. Last night, Biden refused to rule out court packing. In other words, they may take 16, 17, 18 people. He’ll pack the court with radical left judges, who will shred your Second Amendment, disarm law-abiding citizens, and protect terrorists and violent criminals. I won the ban from jihadist countries or other countries. If people are bad, we don’t want them in. So I went for the ban. Everybody said, but I won, I won in the Supreme Court. And you know what? We don’t want people that can’t love our country. We don’t want people that are going to hurt our country. So I have a ban, very controversial. And we won at the United States Supreme Court. And we don’t let people in from certain countries that are going to look to do bad things to us. Pretty amazing what’s happened, isn’t it? Biden’s agenda would also be a catastrophe for Georgia seniors, seniors. Do we have any seniors in the house? We’re proud to be seniors, right? For years, Biden tried to cut your social security, you know that and your Medicare. Now Biden is pledging mass amnesty and free healthcare for illegal aliens, decimating Medicare, and destroying your social security, because that’s what’s going to happen. We all have a heart, and I said this all the time, I mean, I have a heart. I don’t want to hurt people. But once you say, come in, you’re going to get free healthcare, you’re going to get free education. The whole world is going to want to come into our country and we’re not going to be able to even come close to affording it. I have to take care of our seniors. I can’t take care of millions of people that had no intention of coming here before these maniacs made these pledges. He’ll bankrupt these programs to finance the last, open borders. They want to take … actually, we’re just finishing up the wall as I said, they want to take the wall down, some of them. They want to take down the wall. This wall is a dream, goes deep and it goes high. A lot of bad people aren’t coming in because of that. They want to take it down, many of them. While I’m president, no one will touch your Medicare. No one will touch your social security. Under my leadership, we’re delivering a safe vaccine and a rapid recovery. I love the recovery because here I am. I’m mean, that’s … Yeah, two weeks ago I wasn’t exactly feeling great. And when you’re president, I told this today, when you’re president, you got a lot of doctors. You get guys, Johns Hopkins, Walter Reed, you get all the great hospitals. And you got these geniuses, they’re all over the place. “Sir, let me do this. Let me do that. Let me do …” “Just leave me alone, fellas, get the hell out of here.” But I wasn’t feeling too great. And they gave me something, Regeneron, and a day later I felt like Superman. I said, “Hey, whatever the hell1 that stuff was.” And it’s brand new, developed because of this. And we’re going to do something very special. We’re going to get it for every person that we think is appropriate for, in other words, every person that needs it. But I tell you what, they could call it a therapeutic but to me it was a cure. Because the following day … our doctors are here. When you’re president, they follow you. We got more doctors. If anyone gets sick, this is a great time when I’m around, because you’ll have about 15 doctors standing over you in about nine seconds. It’s happened, it’s happened many times. Somebody gets not so well, and all of a sudden, they got the greatest doctors you’ve ever seen. They do a fantastic job, but this was all developed just very recently, months ago for this. It’s incredible, the strides that we’ve made. If you vote for me, prosperity will surge, normal life, that’s all we want. I want a normal life like we had seven months ago. We don’t want any … we want a normal life. That’ll resume and next year will be one of the greatest years economically in the history of our country because that’s where we’re going. This election is a choice between a Trump recovery and a Biden depression. Let me tell you something. He’s going to quadruple your taxes. He’s going to raise taxes on businesses. All the businesses that have moved into a country are going to move out. They’re going back where they came. You’re going to have a disaster. You will have a depression the likes of which this country has never seen before if these crazy rules get in with a Green New Deal. The Green New Deal, the real number is $100 trillion, 100 trillion. They say, well, we could do it for like nine trillion. Well, nine doesn’t work either, but the real price is 100. They want to rip down buildings and build new buildings in their place with tiny little windows. No, if you don’t mind, I’d like to keep my window. I’d like to have a nice view of Georgia. No, they want to, they want to … think of it, think of it. $100 trillion dollars. So if we had a unbelievable economic surge that lasted 100 years without a problem, we wouldn’t make $100 trillion. This is the craziest thing done by AOC plus three, who knows nothing about the environment. She doesn’t know. She’s got a great line of bullshit, that’s about it. No, it’s true. She knows nothing about the environment. AOC plus three, these were not great academics. How about Ilhan Omar? You know I’m going to win Minnesota because of Ilhan Omar. She hates our country. I mean, you see the way she talks, she hates our country. No, please don’t tell her to leave. That happened once before I got in a lot of trouble. They start screaming, she should leave. And they got me in trouble. They said, “Why didn’t he protest?” But she doesn’t like our country, you see what she says. And I’m going to win … remember this, Minnesota hasn’t been one since 1970, that’s a long time, 1972. And we’re going to win Minnesota because of Ilhan Omar. Well, having Minneapolis ripped down, burned down. And then we come in at the end and they should’ve called us on day one, day one. The problem is they keep waiting. They wait until … how about the CNN reporter? I think his name is Velshi, the shaved head, the nice shaved head. Maybe I’ll try that someday. I don’t know. My poll numbers might go down or they might go up. You never know, right? Maybe they’ll go up. But he’s standing there. “This is a friendly protest.” And behind him, the fire is like nine blocks long. It looks like Berlin during the worst days of their lives. The fires are raging. “This is a friendly protest.” Oh boy, oh boy. Then the National Guard started moving forward. He got hit in the knee with a canister of tear gas and he went down. “I’ve been hurt. I’ve been injured.” These people are crazy. They don’t report the violence, they don’t report the looting on CNN, MSDNC, all these different networks. They don’t report them. They don’t want to talk about them. They want to think everything’s wonderful. It’s not, and the reason it’s not, a lot of it is because of them. But I will deliver optimism, opportunity, and hope and that’s what we’re doing. And this is why we have this kind of spirit. And I hate to say it, because I don’t want to insult Georgia, but it’s this way all over our country. We have the biggest rallies in the history of politics. Nobody has rallies like this. Look at that, look at the people. No look, I mean, you can’t see this, this goes all the way back so you can’t even see how far back. I can’t even see the end of it. We have the greatest enthusiasm, the biggest crowds in the history of politics. And they don’t talk about them. They’ll say, “Yes, there were a smattering, a smattering of people.” That’s true. I asked the First Lady, “How did you like it?” “It was good.” “Were there many people there?” I said, “A lot, didn’t they show it?” “No, they don’t show it. They just showed your face. They never go …” She said, “But I could hear it.” When you go to a Georgia football game, when they’re doing well, you can’t imitate, you can imitate thousands and thousands of people with hundreds of people. I mean, Biden had a rally today. Like 13 people showed up and they don’t talk about it. They say, Biden is here. The one guy actually made a mistake, he called him Sleepy Joe, he’s an announcer, that guy’s job is gone. But Vice President Biden is here today, he’s making a speech on the environment. He has no idea what he’s talk … They don’t say that there’s nobody there. He’s got the circles, right? The circles. Do you ever see? He’s got like five circles. And he goes there and people are standing. And the reason that … and the circles, not only are they big, although I love the artistry because the guy really does a nice job. You know I’m into that stuff. It’s very neat, very round, beautiful, solid. I mean, it would be impossible to catch anything if you’re in one of those circles because you’re so far away. But I never joke about it. I mean, I don’t think it’s necessary for Sleepy Joe to constantly … he walks onto a stage, the people are … number one, there’s no people there. And the few people that are there are like what, 50 yards away. And the mask is always so large, it covers the whole … I shouldn’t joke, I shouldn’t joke. Because you know what? Running against the worst candidate in the history of presidential politics puts pressure on me. Could you imagine if I lose? My whole life, what am I going to do? I’m going to say I lost to the worst candidate in the history of politics. I’m not going to feel so good. Maybe I’ll have to leave the country. I don’t know. Biden will deliver pessimism, poverty, and decline. Our nation will decline very seriously. And again, he’s been doing this for 47 years. He said, “Why didn’t Trump move faster?” Well, when I put in the ban on China, because they were heavily infected and then Europe shortly thereafter, Biden called me xenophobic. I said, “Tell me what it means, Joe, please tell me.” I want you to know he was unable to define it. They wrote it down, xenophobic. And he called me a racist, I think, because it was so early. Now time goes by and he said, “He should have done it earlier. He should have done it earlier.” But he was months behind me, remember? He thought it was terrible that we closed down to China. And Fauci said, and he said very nicely, he said, “Trump saved thousands of lives by making that decision.” And to be honest, I was like just about the only one that wanted to do it. Joe Biden would terminate our recovery, delay the vaccine, prolong the pandemic, and annihilate Georgia’s economy. And you’re doing a great job, and you have a governor that’s working hard, and he’s doing a great job. I don’t even know if he’s here but he’s working hard and he’s doing a great job. We’re going to find out. And you’ve got a great First Lady. And we’re working to safely reopen our schools, reopen the schools, get those schools open all over our country. It’s so bad. You know Barron, right? Barron tested positive, my son. I said, “Are you okay?” ” Yeah, I’m okay.” Like about two seconds later, “How’s he doing? “Oh, he’s okay now, sir.” Because they have a great immune system, I guess. Who the hell knows? I mean, they have an immune system, 99.9 something percent, right? They’re young and they’re strong. I mean, for this particular disease, the flu they have problems with young children, real problems, real, real death problems. But for this, it’s 99.99 something, I mean, it’s like incredible. But no, Barron tested positive. The First Lady’s doing great, she’s doing great. She’s doing a great job. And she didn’t do the Regeneron thing. She did it the old-fashioned way, she got better. But Barron, Barron, young kid, healthy kid, but he tested positive. And by the time I got to speak to the doctor the next time, it was like, “How’s he doing, Doc?” “He’s okay, now, sir, he’s gone.” I said, “It’s gone, that quick?” But this is what happens. And then you’re immune. It could be a long time. Barron’s … everyone loves Barron. Do you think he’s tall enough? He’s a tall, young guy, but he’s doing good. But it’s an amazing thing, the children. That’s why they have to get back to school. We have to protect our seniors very much. We have to protect our seniors and that’s what we’re doing. But we have to protect our seniors. We have to protect certain groups, especially our seniors, where they have a heart problem or they have a diabetes problem. But we got to get our businesses open. Now, in your case, your governor was very early, he did a great job. But you look at what’s happened, you look at what’s happened in New York. You look at what’s happening in Michigan. We won the case. The court ruled, it was unconstitutional. She was keeping everybody like in prison, except her husband. She was keeping everybody … no, she was keeping everybody in prison. Pennsylvania, they got to open this state. We’re going to do well in Pennsylvania too by the way, watch. North Carolina, we have Mark Meadows here, by the way, from North Carolina, our great chief of staff. Where’s Mark? Our great chief of staff, he’s working. He said, “Boy, this is …” He was a very successful congressman and he’s been doing a fantastic job. Where’s Mark? He’s doing a great job. Is it an easy job, Mark? No problem. But Biden will close your classrooms and you know that. He actually said the other day, he’ll follow science. So that means if Fauci says, “Close it up.” He’s going to close up the country, it’s not going to happen, it’s not going to happen. And if you look at the numbers, the numbers are great. And we’re going to go over that. He wants to throw your children out of the school, close up your schools, and shut down your workplace. And we’re now setting records for employment, unemployment. We’re setting all sorts of records economically. Europe, which has imposed punishing, punishing, horrible, really strong lockdowns is now experiencing a massive surge in cases. The fake news would say, “Well, look at Europe.” I said, “We’re doing better than Europe.” But now Europe is exploding and they’ll be okay, but they’re exploding. Biden’s plan will crush America. My plan will crush the virus, and America will be stronger than ever before. So our early and aggressive action saved, I think at least two million lives. We pioneered life-saving therapies and reduced the fatality rate. 85%, think of that. That’s over a six month period. And I’m working to make the antibody treatment and I’ve said it and I got it. And I said, “Listen, for me, it was great.” And I bet for a lot of people, it’s great. These are the great scientists. They came up with some of the other incredible medicines of the last 10 years, this particular firm. But also Eli Lilly, it’s very similar. And we’re going to make it available free to anybody that needs it, free. Should be getting the final approvals very soon. By the way, I’m getting approvals from the FDA that people would have taken three years to get. And those vaccines are coming out, but it’s political. Even now, I could have had them faster, but we had little action. Nobody wanted me to get the approval before the election. And you know what, I’m not thinking about the election. I’m thinking about saving lives, the hell with the election. I’m thinking about saving lives. So that got a little political. Through Operation Warp Speed, we will have 100 million vaccine doses before the end of the year and maybe substantially before that. The vaccine will end the pandemic once and for all. And they hate it when I say it, we got the vaccine, it’s really looking great. Numerous companies, Johnson and Johnson, Moderna, Pfizer, [inaudible 01:11:52] others too, many companies, all of them, they’re great. But you know what, without the vaccine it’s ending too. We’re rounding the turn, it’s ending without the vaccine. But the vaccine is going to make it go quicker. Let’s get rid of it. We want to get it the hell out of here. So we’re joined tonight by a man who I am so proud that I gave a very early endorsement to, and I did it because of David Purdue. David said, “Donald … Mr. President, I have somebody who’s running for governor.” I said, “Governor of where?” He said, “The great state of Georgia.” I said, “Tell me, what’s his story?” He said, “Could you endorse him?” I said, “Well, tell me about him.” I did a little research. And the only thing that mattered to me, I mean, to be honest with you, he’s all Trump all the way, before I knew him, I didn’t know him. He had a very successful past, but I didn’t know him. But he was very … he was like Trump, he likes Trump. And it’s hard to endorse people that don’t like you, somehow I have a little problem with that. But his name … I said, “What’s his name?” “Brian Kemp, but he’s a really smart guy, really good guy.” And I endorsed him and he went on to win. And his wonderful wife, Marty, is even better than him. But I have to tell you, we campaigned together. We campaigned together. And I mean, I’ve never seen, we campaigned against, I guess Stacey, and we had Oprah. Oprah used to be a friend of mine before I went into politics. She’d be down in Mar-a-Lago a lot. She liked our key lime pie. She liked our key lime … but Oprah was great, she was a friend of mine. But once you do this stuff, you lose a lot of friends very quickly, but that’s okay. We’re got to do the right thing. And we had Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, they practically lived in Georgia and all Brian had was Trump, and Brian won fairly easily, it wasn’t that close. Brian Kemp. Great guy, and Marty, thank you very much, that’s great. He’s a great governor and he was ahead of the curve. He said, “We got to get this thing open here”. And those are the states that are doing the best, the ones that are doing these lockdowns, not to mention the problems caused with depression, drugs, alcoholism, all of the other things. So I just want to thank Brian and Marty and it’s great and you’re doing good. How am I doing by the way, Brian, are we going to win it? Because if we’re not, I’ll tell you what, I’m going to take my endorsement away from him if I don’t. No, you’re doing a great job as governor, thank you very much. Brian Kemp, thank you everybody. Another guy, he’s been a friend of mine for a long time. He’s a very, very successful man. And he did what I did, he wanted to do something, he wanted to give back. He loves this state like crazy. He loves our country and he’s central casting. If I’m casting a movie and I want to pick a senator, you know what I do? I say, “I got to get David Perdue to play the role.” But he is respected by everybody in Washington. He is respected and revered, and he brings back the bacon to this state, I want to tell you. He came to see me … David, stand up. He came to see me about the farmers when they got … that’s how I got involved in the whole thing and the hurricanes and all the damage. And we brought in a lot of money for our farmers in Georgia, right, David? So thank you very much, great job. You’re doing a fantastic job. And come to think of it, I can’t even believe … The guy that’s running against him, I beat him once before. Two years ago, he was running against a very good woman, Karen, right, Karen Handel. And she’s doing very well. But he was running against her and we defeated him. And then he said he’s running against David. I said, “This guy’s not in the same league with David Purdue.” I mean, that puts a lot of pressure on David, just like I have pressure on me. You’re running against these people. It puts more pressure on you, David. It would be easier to run against somebody that was good. But he’s a radical left Schumer, Pelosi guy. He’s bad on the Second Amendment. I remember when he was running, he didn’t even live in the district. He’s running for Congress. I said, “What’s going on?” But we defeated them once and I hear you’re going to defeat him again. Thank you, David. So a person who’s become a friend of mine and Brian thought she was fantastic. And I met her and I said, “The only thing is, how would you handle pressure? You never know, this is a rough, mean business.” And I found that she can handle pressure. She has been fantastic. She was with me 100% on the impeachment hoax. She’s been with us all the way. And she’s a great woman and her husband is a great man, and a very successful man. That’s a good thing not a bad thing, by the way. Some people would like to say, “Oh, the husband’s a great failure. It’s much better.” No, no, no, he’s a really respected person. And he loves his wife and she’s a terrific person, Kelly Loeffler, Kelly. Thank you, great job. Great job, Kelly. Great job. I mean, my only problem she’s running against another great guy. I just said, run it out. I’m backing both of them because Doug Collins is here. Where’s Doug? Boy, am I in a lousy position. I like them both. I love them both. He’s been unbelievable with the impeachment hoax and everything else. He’s a warrior, she’s a warrior. But you know what I like, they’re both going to the polls. They’re going to bring their people with them. And you know that the biggest winner is going to be, Trump, because everybody that votes for both of them is going to vote for me. But honestly, regardless of what happens, they’re both going to be winners because whoever doesn’t officially win is going to have an unbelievable future. And I’m going to make sure of it because these are two incredible people. You, you, and I mean it. But what a lousy position to be in, David, right? I like both of them, oh boy. So we have somebody, Jody Hice, you know Jody? Stand up, Jody, what a job, a warrior, a warrior. Thank you very much for everything, Jody. Jody’s only leading his district by about 5,000 points, so we don’t have to worry too much. We don’t have to spend too much time. You’re doing a great job, Jody, we appreciate it very much. Barry Loudermilk, Barry, thank you very much. Great job, great job. These are warriors, these are incredible people. Rick Allen, Rick, thank you, thank you. And another one who wanted a guy … he knows more about the farming industry. When I was picking the Secretary of Agriculture, they had all these political people come in. I said, “Do you know anything about farms?” “No, sir. I don’t, but I’m a quick learner.” I said, “Oh, that’s great.” I’m interviewing these people. And I went through about nine of them. And so far I didn’t have any guy. I said, “Do you know what corn looks like? Do you know anything?” No, some of them had absolutely zero. I said, “Have you ever been to a farm?” “No, sir. But I’m willing to learn.” I said, “Oh, this is what I want.” And then I meet this guy named Sonny Perdue. Somebody said … And Sonny came, I remember that meeting so much. And Sonny came into my office. And by the way, David called and Sonny called also about Brian, right, you know that, Brian, both of them. But he comes into my office and I’m telling you to this day, I learned more about farming in that 45 minute meeting that I learned ever in my life. I learned it all from you and you have done a great job and you’ve delivered $28 billion and I hear another 13 billion is coming to our farmers. Right, he loves our farmers. He’s been great. He’s been an incredible Secretary of Agriculture, stand up again Sonny, come on, they like you. By the way, I guess he was also your governor like for eight years, right? I don’t even count that. I don’t care about that. But he was a very popular governor, Brian, you know that, he was very popular. He did a great job. But he was your governor for eight years, but he has been a fantastic Secretary of Agriculture. Thank you, Sonny. I’m glad I could say it in front of your home friends, okay. And state representative Vernon Jones. How about Vernon, how about Vernon? Where’s Vernon? Man, what a guy. Look at this. I saw him on television a few months ago and he’s talking about Trump is the greatest, he’s the strongest, what he’s done for our military, what he’s done on the… And I say, “Well, this is a great guy. I wonder where he…” And obviously, I said, “He’s a Republican.” And they put the thing on the bottom. It says Vernon Jones, Democrat from wherever the hell he comes from. I said, “There must be a typo. He’s better than any Republican. I can’t believe it.” And then I checked him out and he’s a Democrat who likes Trump. And we love him. Vernon, thank you. And he’s a popular guy. Amazing. Amazing. He spoke at our convention. And somebody who’s doing a fantastic job, Insurance Commissioner John King. John, thank you. Great job, John. Appreciate it. Public Service Commissioners Bubba McDonald, and Tricia Pridemore. Thank you very much, both. Thank you, Bubba. Thank you, Tricia. Thank you, Tricia. And somebody who better lead us to victory or I’ll never speak to him again. We’ll have a new State Chairman of the Georgia GOP if we don’t win, but we’re going to win. David Shafer. David, thank you. How are we doing, David? How are we… Good? Way up? I saw a poll, we’re way up. Don’t just pretend we’re even. You know what they do in politics? David Perdue taught me this. Pretend you’re one point down and then work your ass off, and then just sit home and watch. That’s what happened four years ago. Was that the greatest evening ever? But this is going to be better. This is going to be better. This is, in its own way, even more important. Candidates for Congress. Andrew Clyde. Andrew, thank you, Andrew. That’s great. Good luck. I heard you’re doing really well. And somebody that I just think is fantastic. This one, I never ever want to have her as my enemy. Marjorie Taylor Greene. Where is she? She is so unbelievable. You are so unbelievable. Thank you. And I looked at some poll numbers here. You’re really up, but just pretend you’re one point down, please. Okay? But you’re doing great. They love you. Thank you very much. Congratulations. Great job. And finally, Angela Stanton King. Angela, great. It’ll be another great victory. That’s going to be a great victory. Thank you very much, Angela. Great job. Congratulations. And last but not least, we have a woman that won us the state of Michigan, Ronna McDaniel. Ronna, she was the chair of Michigan, and she kept bringing me back and back and back. And I said, “Who is this woman?” And then we won Michigan, which hadn’t… And by the way, we’re up in Michigan, it was just announced. We have a lot of car companies moving into Michigan. Thank you. Thank you. She’s done a fantastic job. Now, when it came time to pick the head of the Republican National Committee, I said, “Who is that woman in Michigan that kept getting me back there?” Every week, I’d get a call. “Sir, you have to come back. You can win Michigan.” I said, “Michigan hasn’t been won in 38 years.” She said, “I’m telling you, you’re going to win.” All right. So I went back and back, and each time I’d say, “Look, that’s it. Okay? That’s it.” It’s a big deal. She said, “No, that’s okay.” So that’s it. The next day I get a call. “You have to come back once more.” And it was actually my last stop. It was at one 1:00 in the morning now, actually, election day. We had 32,000 people show up at 1:00 in the morning in Grand Rapids, right? Grand Rapids, Michigan. And we ended up winning the state of Michigan. First time in many decades. And now we’re doing well. A poll just came out, Ronna, we’re up in Michigan. You know why? Because they had no car companies, they had no plants, they had no nothing for 44 years. And they’re building plants all over the state of Michigan because of me. And they’re coming in from Japan and they’re coming in from Germany. They’re building plants all over and expanding plants. So I think Michigan likes us. We’ve done the job. Thank you very much. Congratulations. Thank you. Done a great job. And get out there, these three candidates for Senate, you got to get out there. Really get out there and go. They’re unbelievable people. They’re unbelievable. Three unbelievable people. And we appreciate it. Under my administration, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world, which is true. There’s never been anything like it. And now we are doing it again. I see these hats, make America great again. So you know what I say? Make America great again again. Make America great again again. We had it done and then the plague came in from China. We’re not forgetting that. You watch. We’re tariffing the hell out of them. We’re getting so much money. Our farmers were targeted, we gave it to our farmers, so that’s fine. In my first three years, family income increased by $6,000. Think of that. $6,000 a family. More than five times the gains in all eight years under the Obama-Biden administration. Remember this. And I said it today. I never even thought of it. If they were good, I wouldn’t be your president. I wouldn’t have run. If they were good, I wouldn’t have even run. But they were horrible, so I won. If they were good and I did run, I wouldn’t have won because they would have done a good job and I wouldn’t have won. They were horrible. They had Ferguson. They had all of the problems in different places. Oakland. They had tremendous… Baltimore. They had nothing but problems. It was a disaster. And the trade deals were the worst. And the Iran deal with $150 billion. We got nothing. And $1.8 billion in cash. African-American income grew nine times more, nine times, than it did under Biden and Obama. They called up David today. They said, “Sir, we have bad news.” “What’s the bad news?” “Obama’s going to start campaigning for Sleepy Joe.” I said, “Is that good or bad? Why is it bad?” Because he campaigned harder for Hillary than she did. He was very ineffective as a campaigner to be. I thought he was very ineffective. So I think that’s good news. But if you remember, remember this. He was the vice president for eight years to Obama and Obama refused to endorse him. You know why? Because he knows he’s mentally shot. He shot. And Obama, look, he’s a Patriot. And he says you can have a guy like this. And then he ended up lucking out because Warren wouldn’t get out of the race, and so they were splitting up the vote. And what did he do? He wouldn’t do it. It took him forever to make the endorsement, David. Right? It took him forever. And finally, because he couldn’t believe it. He couldn’t believe this guy won. But they said he’s going to be campaigning for him. Just remember what I said. He never thought it was possible that he won. And then even after he won, he couldn’t do it. But he finally got it done. To bring opportunity, security, fairness, and prosperity to black communities, I recently announced the Platinum Plan, which is a big deal. We will create 3 million new jobs for black Americans, increase access to capital, restore safety to every neighborhood. And we will deliver school choice, which is the most important thing. We’re doing that. That’s all done. And remember this. And I say this, and some people think it’s a lot, but it’s true. They don’t challenge me. With the exception of Abraham Lincoln, nobody has done more for the black community than Donald Trump. It’s true. It’s true. I got criminal justice reform. That was me. That was not anybody else but me, and they came to see me. I got criminal justice reform done, prison reform. Opportunity zones done with Tim Scott from South Carolina. Great senator, great man, great person. He’s a great, great person. And I got all of this stuff done. Opportunity zones. And we did historically black colleges and universities. Every year, they would come up, the heads of these colleges and universities, black colleges and universities, really good people. And after the third year, I said, “How come you keep coming?” Because they didn’t have any deal. So every year, they had to come. I said, “What do you feel like?” He said, one man, great guy. He said, “I feel like a beggar because every year, we come up and beg for money.” I got them 10 year absolute funding. Historically black colleges. Obama wouldn’t do it. Biden wouldn’t do it. Nobody did it. I did it. Just remember criminal justice reform. That’s the biggest thing. Biden has vowed to ban school choice and charter schools, devastating the black community. We’ve spent the last four years reversing the damage that Joe Biden inflicted over the last 47 years with his stupidity. He backed NAFTA, he backed TPP, which would have been a disaster if I didn’t stop it. And China’s entry into the World Trade Organization, one of the worst things that’s ever happened to our country. For decades, our politicians spent trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign wars, countries that you’ve never even heard of, and defending foreign borders, but we didn’t defend their own borders. But now we’re finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities. And we are bringing our jobs, our factories, and our troops back home to the USA. About time. About time. They’re all coming home. They’re all coming home. We invested $2.5 trillion in the US military and launched the first new branch of the United States Armed Forces in 75 years. So necessary. The Space Force, and they helped us get it approved. And for our great veterans, we passed VA Choice and VA Accountability. And you heard two weeks ago, we got a 91% approval rating from our vets. First time this ever happened. We took over 100% of the ISIS caliphate in Iraq and Syria. And when I took over, it was a mess. And we killed the leader of ISIS, who was trying to reform ISIS. Al-Baghdadi is dead. We took out the world’s number one terrorist and the mass murderer of American troops and troops all over the world and many, many people. Soleimani is dead. I withdrew from the last administration’s disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal. They spent $150 billion to Iran that they used for terror. $1.8 billion in cash. I terminated. By the way, my first phone call, if we win, will be from the head of Iran saying, “Let’s make a deal.” Their economy is in tatters right now. They went down 27% GDP. I’ve never even heard of such a thing. But you know what? We don’t want that. We want them to do fine, but they can never have a nuclear weapon. I recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem. And it’s all built. It’s all built. It’s all built. It’s all built. Not only did we get it approved, I got the building built. I said, “Find the building on the site that we own.” And they came to me. You know that story? They were going to spend $2 billion to build an embassy. I said, “That sounds like a lot.” And I called our great ambassador. I said, “David, do we have any land in Jerusalem?” He said, “Yeah, we have a great site.” I said, “Take a look at it. Call me.” He calls me, he said, “There’s a building on the site. We can renovate it. Now, we’re going to spend anywhere from $1 billion to $2 billion.” I said, “Well, let’s do this. Can we do something?” “Yes, sir.” He calls me back a week later, he said, “Sir, we can renovate the building fully for $350,000 [inaudible 01:34:50]” It’s the first time in my life or in my business career I ever did this. I said, “David, it’s too cheap. It doesn’t sound good.” Normally I’d say, “Let’s make it $250,000.” I said, “David, make it $500,000 and use Jerusalem Stone.” I have a friend, Ron Baron, smart guy. He’s so proud. He’s got Jerusalem Stone in his lobby of his office building. And I said, “Can you get Jerusalem Stone?” He said, “Yeah, we’re in Jerusalem.” I said, “That’s good.” The whole place is Jerusalem Stone and it was cheap as hell, I’ll tell you. So we built this building for under $500,000 and it’s been open for a long time. And every president for many, many decades has said they were going to do it, and not one of them got it done. And I got it done and got the building built. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. 52 years, they were working on that. They were working on it for 52 years, I got done in about two and a half hours. And instead of endless war, we are forging peace in the Middle East without blood all over the sand. You see what’s going on. UAE, Bahrain. And we have countries lined up to sign. The fact is, I did more in 47 months than Sleepy Joe Biden did in 47 years. And now the Democrats are pushing the most far left agenda ever put forward by a presidential nominee. The Biden plan would destroy Social Security and destroy protections for pre-existing conditions. People with pre-existing conditions are never going to get it. Their plan, and this Green New Deal, will destroy our country. It’s crazy. When I first heard it, I thought they were joking, actually. I thought, oh, not even cows do they want. They don’t want cows. I think they gave up on that one, but they didn’t really give up. They will never give up. Biden’s running mate sponsored a bill to outlaw private health insurance, 180 million people that love their private plans. They love their private plans. Those plans are going to be gone. Biden vowed to terminate our travel bans on jihadist regions and surge refugee admissions 700%, opening the flood gates to radical Islamic terrorism. Your state and your country will be overrun and overwhelmed. We’ll have no money and we will, indeed, be another Venezuela, very large scale version. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans. It’s a vote for the American dream. It’s the American dream, and we’re going to have it bigger and better than we ever had before. And in conclusion, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we will end our reliance on China once and for all. It’s already taking place. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms. Second Amendment. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens. And we will keep America out of these absolutely ridiculous, endless foreign wars. Our troops are coming home. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. And I want to tell you, we have the greatest weapons, much of it built ever in the history of any country in the world. We are the envy of China and Russia and North Korea and everybody. And when I came here, one of our most overrated generals in the world told me, one of the most overrated generals, he said, “Sir, we have no ammunition.” And I said, “No president should ever, ever hear that.” And now we have ammunition like you wouldn’t believe. But we have rockets and we have missiles and we have tanks and we have F-35s and all sorts of aircraft tankers and bombers. Only hope to God we never have to use it. That’s all. But we are the envy of the world. We have rebuilt our military, $2.5 trillion, and we have never had anything like it. So just hope we never have to use it. We will end surprise medical building, require price transparency, and further reduce the cost of prescription drugs. They’ll be coming down 80%, 90%, 70%. We will strongly protect Medicare and Social Security, and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. So important. America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. And that’s moving along rapidly. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto: in God we trust. In God we trust. For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great state of Georgia. I love Georgia. Early voting is underway. So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, get your boss if you have a boss. Say, “Boss, you come with me right now.” And get out and vote early. Get out and vote. A giant red wave is coming from Atlanta to Augusta, from Savannah to Columbus, and from Marietta to right here in Macon, Georgia. I love you, Macon. Macon, Georgia. We inherit the legacy of Georgia patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for this beloved nation. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blazed the trails, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, raised up the giant skyscrapers, won two World Wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And we are making it greater every single day. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of Georgia, we have made America wealthy again, we have made America strong again, we have made America proud again. We will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Georgia. Thank you very much. Thank you.

"88","10-17-20","Thank you very much. Thank you. Whoa, what a crowd. Oh, what a crowd. I’ve been here many times. I say we want car plants built here. We’re building a lot of them. We’re building a lot of them. Well, hello, Michigan. Great to be with you. Great. Special place. It’s great to be back in this incredible state with thousands of loyal, hardworking American Patriots. We’re all Patriots. 17 days from now, we’re going to win this state of Michigan. We’re going to win four more years in the White House. I’d like to speak with you today about one of the most vital issues in this race. You know what it is? It’s the radical left’s plan to erase American history, purge American values, and destroy the American way of life, and that’s what they’re trying to do. You see it every day. That’s what they’re trying to do. We’re not going to let that happen. This election will decide whether we preserve our magnificent heritage or whether we allow far left radicals to wipe it all away. That’s not going to happen. Joe Biden, sleepy Joe, has made a corrupt bargain in exchange for his party’s nomination. He has handed control of his party over to the hardcore militant left. You know that. You see that every day. The Democrat party you once knew, just no longer it exists, right? This is not the same party. These people are crazy. It’s now the party of socialists, Marxists and left wing extremists. If Biden wins, the lawless demonstrators in our streets, that are around Democrat run cities and state, not Republican run. These are Democrat run and we want to go in and we want to help them. And largely they don’t want to be helped. It’s an incredible thing, but they’re all over our streets and these areas will be ended. We want to end it. We want to end it. And you know, in theory, they’re supposed to say, please come in. They don’t like to say it. Minneapolis, they said it. We went in and boy did that take about what, 30 minutes to solve that problem? And that’s why we’re going to win Minnesota. Hasn’t been won since 1972 by a Republican. We’re going to win Minnesota. Of course, having people like Omar doesn’t hurt either. Omar, Ilhan Omar. She doesn’t love our country too much. I don’t think so. They crave power and God help us if they ever did get it. God help us. I can tell you that. You just have to look all over the world at different places. God help us. This election day, the people of Michigan must stop these anti-American radicals by issuing Joe Biden and his group a thundering defeat at the ballot box. And by the way, it seems to be happening. Seems to be happening. Seems to be happening. I don’t want to speak too early, but you know, there’s a big story out right now. Do you know that? Do you know about it, right? You know, we’re supposed to be way behind you until election day when all the Republicans go and you’re going to have a red wave like you’ve never seen before. And even the fake news media saying that we’re going to have a wave. We’re going to have a wave like you’ve never seen before, but we’re supposed to be way behind for the first few days. So it just came out. We’re leading. What’s that? Early voting. But let’s not talk about it. You know they call that an early maybe signal, right? Maybe. Who knows. But there’s a lot of concern going on out there. This sounds like a little bit like four years ago, but this should be much bigger because we’ve done everything we said and more. We’ve done it all. In your case, we brought your plants back. Do you remember 12 years ago or so I got Man of the Year in Michigan. I said, “Well, that’s nice.” I came to Michigan and I made this speech like why are you allowing them to take your automobile business, your car making business? Why are you allowing them to take it to Mexico and Canada and every place else? Why are you allowing? I made this big deal. I actually got blasted for it. They named me Man of the Year and I’m complaining, right? But no, it’s probably why I’m here. It’s probably the number one thing what they were doing to us [inaudible 00:05:07]. But now Michigan has many, many factories. You didn’t have a factory built for 40 years. Now you have many factories being built, already built. And a lot of them being expanded. It’s a whole different ball game. A whole different ball game. And they come in from Japan. I’ll tell you, he just a retired, a great man. Prime Minister Abe. And I said to him, six months ago, I said, “Mr. Prime Minister, you got to get us some more factories. You’re selling cars to us. We’re not taxing you. You know, a lot of crazy policies, but you got to get us.” And he said, “Well, this is a thing for companies.” I said, “You have great power.” He said, “Well, the government doesn’t get involved.” “You got to do it.” And he said, “Well, we will look into it.” Next day, they announced five factories coming in. [inaudible 00:05:57] And he was a great Prime Minister and a great guy and he’s a friend of ours. And he was forced. He had a medical difficulty, but I’ll tell you what, what a fabulous guy. But we had, I mean, what you’re doing in Michigan has been amazing. Now you got to get your governor to open up your state. Okay? And get your schools open. Get your schools open. The schools have to be open, right? Lock them all up. And by the way, you can show all these people. Look where that goes, all the way over to there, and all the way. You can show. Turn the cameras. What did you turn? They never like turning the cameras. They never like to show the kind of crowds. That’s a lot of people. That’s a lot of people. Go ahead. Turn your camera. Go ahead. Turn it. They hate to do it. They hate to show the crowds. You know, if you’re watching television, which a lot of people are when we do this stuff or they wouldn’t put us on, but they always have like this face right here. This and… About four people behind me. We’ve actually made a couple of stars. You know, there’s somebody behind me here, here, here. They try and show us few people as possible. And if they had a certain look, it worked out pretty well. They became stars, right? It’s the way it works. That’s the way it works. But you know, it’s really no, it’s an honor to have. And we’re having these crowds, in all fairness, all over the country. I don’t even say anymore. Was it a big crowd? I just get off the plane and we talk. And this spirit is so incredible. Our enthusiasm is so incredible. It’s so incredible. No, the spirit is incredible. I don’t think there’s ever been anything, like that little phrase. I won’t even say it because they’ll say, “Oh, why is he bringing that up?” So I won’t say it, but you’ll say it. But that’s never been used before. Nobody’s ever heard that before. And we like Ronald Reagan. We like a lot of people. Nobody’s ever heard that phrase before. You know why? Because first of all, we’ve made tremendous progress. We’ve rebuilt our military. We’ve cut your taxes at the highest level. We’ve gotten rid of more regulations than any president in history no matter how long they were in office. Oh, by the way, we just set a record. By the end of the first term, we will have had maybe even more than 300 federal judges and, and, and three great Supreme Court Justices. So you have Justice Kavanaugh, Justice Gorsuch, and you have Amy is going through right now. She’s going through. She’s great. She’s done amazingly well. It’s amazing to watch her compared to some of these radical left senators. It’s like from a different ball game, right? It’s like, go ahead. Go ahead. Hold up, we’d like to see your notes. Oh, okay. Here they are. There’s nothing. Unlike Joe, she doesn’t need notes. It’s nice, right? Joe. He takes out, the other day, did you see it? He takes out notes. Uh, 200 billion dollars. He’s lost it. You know that. The modern left does not use reason or persuasion to advance their cause. They use intimidation, coercion and control and worse. They demand absolute allegiance or else. And you saw that yesterday. Did you see Diane Feinstein? Lindsey Graham is a good guy. You know, they’re friendly. They’ve been working forever together. And she happened to grab him. He grabbed her, you know, it’s a friendly. They want to destroy the woman. These people are sick. I know we want to bring it all together. But we got to sort of work on these things. One of the most sinister weapons of the extreme left culture is a thing called cancel or cancel culture. They want to cancel our entire heritage. If you do not repeat each and every one of their lies, you will be banned, censored, big tech titan is what they do. They’re harassed. They expel. They fire you from your job or deny the chance to earn a living. Here in Michigan, to teach you is fired for tweeting that Trump is our president. She got fired. Where is she? Is she here tonight? No, can you imagine? But you know, we got a lot of people that like that. We like that person a lot. Whoever you are, we love you and we’ll be there for you. We’ll be there for you. Did you hear about that? I mean, did you hear about that? Nobody told me you’re going to have 40 mile an hour winds today. Would somebody give me a hat? Will you please give me a hat? I got all these hats. I’m the only one without a hat on. Get me a hat. They’ll get it. They’ll go into that big, beautiful plane. If they don’t have a hat in that plane. Look at that. Is that beautiful? That’s a beautiful plane. We have a beautiful country. Actually, I have the exact same plane, Boeing 757. It’s a beautiful plane. Look at that though. Get me a hat out of that plane, please. In Ohio, a high school football player was suspended for displaying a flag honoring our great police. You saw that. When the New York Times published a piece by Senator Tom Cotton, by the way, great Senator from Arkansas. Great. Great, great guy and great Senator. The Editor of the New York Times had to resign because they put Tom Cotton’s brilliant, he’s a brilliant person, brilliant student, brilliant everything, they put his piece in the New York Times, and the person that put it in had to resign. No, can you believe this? When the Philadelphia Inquirer published a piece saying that rioters shouldn’t destroy buildings, that was the end of that journalist. I mean, can you believe it? These are not the tactics of a respectable political movement. This is the behavior of fascists and as bad as you can get. The point of cancel culture is not to convince you, it’s to humiliate you, and break you, and control you. But the American people will never submit, we will never apologize, and we will not be controlled, and never be broken. No, nobody’s seen anything what’s going on. And now in other countries, you have seen it. And those countries have, in every single case, ended up very badly. It’s never going to happen to this country, and this country will never be a socialist country, and just remember. Never. The most divisive and insidious strategy of the Marxists, and the Democrat socialists, and communists, in all fairness. You know, people say, “Oh, that’s not nice to use.” Well, that’s the step. That’s the next step, you know? That’s where it goes. Is their crusade against American history? Right? American history. And I just brought this out because they had things. You wouldn’t even believe this. They falsely and constantly smear America as a sinister and racist country that must be torn apart piece by piece. Has to be torn apart. We’re not tearing anything apart. We’re here today and you know the truth. America is the most magnificent, most virtuous nation that has ever existed. The most. We’ve liberated millions from tyranny, rescued countless millions all around the world from poverty, and built the most exceptional Republic in human history. There’s never been anything close. And you know what? I have a little secret just in this group, this small group of thousands of people, we’re getting better and better and stronger, and we’re going to have the best year we ever had. Yet the radical left despises this glorious inheritance. They despise it. When you watch and you see AOC plus three, and you see these people, they actually despise it. Last month, the mayor of Washington D.C. released a report that proposed the idea of removing or altering the Washington Monument, the Jefferson Memorial, the statues of Benjamin Franklin, Andrew Jackson and Christopher Columbus. No, this is a serious report. He says, “They’re sick.” I agree. I agree, I just, I’m not allowed to say that. No, this was a group, a star spangled group, let’s get rid of the Washington Monument. Oh, that’s a great idea, right? No, these people, but you know what? We laugh and we smile and everyone thinks it’s… When this first started happening with statues of people that most of us, almost all of us, never heard of. I said, “Be careful because they’ll go after Jefferson, Washington. They’ll go after Lincoln.” And that was three years ago. Now, a friend of mine came to me the other day. He said, “You know, you said this was going to happen.” I said, “I did?” He said, “Yeah, you did. You said all of a sudden it’ll keep going up.” They took out Robert E. Lee. They want to take out Grant. They want to take out anything. They basically want to take out our heritage and we’re not letting this happen. And Biden has absolutely no control. He’s shot, number one, but even if he wasn’t shot, he never had the kind of control that you have to have to be President. So then you have a group of people that want to blow up a gorgeous thing. You know, we were leading by so much. This thing wasn’t even going to be an election. And then we had the plague come in. You know, I had to go back to work on this stuff. I didn’t have to come to Michigan. I said, “Look, we’re building all these plants.” You got the best of year. You had the best year last year that you’ve ever had. You’re going to have a better year. You’re going to have a better year. You’re going to have a better year next year. But this thing was over. You know, look, nothing’s ever over, right? But I would have had to work about one tenth, maybe less than that. It was essentially… We had the greatest economy, greatest employment, African American, Asian American, Hispanic American, women with a diploma from high school, without a diploma from high school, top of your class at MIT, it didn’t matter. You had the greatest economy you ever had. And don’t worry, you’re going to have that next year. Wait until you see the third quarter numbers. You’re going to have great numbers. Okay? You’re going to have great numbers. But, but we had to close it up and we saved millions of lives. It was supposed to be 2.2. The fake news never says that. But we are rebuilding and we’re doing things that you wouldn’t believe. But this cancel culture. So when we started, and I had to start all over, and we had to do things a lot different. We became a lot different country for a period of time because we had this horrible plague that came from China. And we’re not going to forget that it came from China and all over the world it went, and it came from China. Okay? It came from China, the China virus. So things changed and we signed an incredible trade deal with China, but the ink hadn’t even dried and this happened. But I made a speech at a magnificent place called Mount Rushmore, right? Mount Rushmore in South Dakota. And I made this speech and I think it was a very good speech, and it was well received and all of that. It was so beautiful. The whole place, you have to see this. It was so beautiful. And the governor is fantastic. You know Kristi, right? Fantastic. And the people are fantastic and they’re so proud of it. And then I read where they want to blow up Mount Rushmore before I got there. I mean, they want to blow it up. We want to blow the face off Mount Rushmore. I don’t think that’s happening. I think the people of South Dakota might not handle that too well, so it’s not happening. But think of it. Where does this thinking come from? Where does this sickness come from? And we have to stop it. And we’ve been. Sleepy Joe said nothing when statues of Christopher Columbus, think of that, Christopher Columbus. They want to blow up all the statues. Now he just blew the Italian vote, by the way. So I don’t know. Anybody who’s Italian here, by any chance? If you’re Italian, do you happen to like Christopher Columbus? Christopher? Christopher Columbus. No. Think of it. You’re Italian. They want to blow up. You know, we had it. I think it was in New York. So they were going to rip down this gorgeous, right in New York, right? And the Italian circled that they saw. That was the end of those people. They just sort of went away. You know, they’re sitting there and standing there and they had various things that they were holding. I won’t get into that because they’ll say, “That’s terrible. He’s inciting violence.” The President. No, but the Italians, a group of Italians that lived in the neighborhood surrounded this particular statue. And after about a five minutes of talk back and forth, the radical anarchists and the Antifa people that nobody ever liked to talk about, they don’t like to say Antifa. They don’t like to say Antifa. They like to blame everything on the right. This is the left. They like to blame everything on the right. But the Antifa people, okay? So they wanted to do it. But when they saw this group of people, they said, “You know what? Let’s take a pass. Let’s go someplace else and rip down a statue.” But now they’re not doing it too much because I signed into law, I signed a bill that gives you 10 years in jail if you rip down any federal statue. So this is the group though. So this is the statues and memorial recommendation using the mayor’s position, Washington D.C., or in the National Capitol Memorial Advisory Commission recommend the federal government remove relocate the following: Christopher Columbus statue, Benjamin Franklin statue, Andrew Jackson, great, great general, really good President, a great general, Andrew Jackson, the Battle of New Orleans, right? Right? The ragtags. Remember? He came in with the British. They came in their beautiful uniforms. He had the ragtags. The battle lasted about a half hour. Right? They want to take that statue of Andrew Jackson down right away. Thomas Jefferson, that’s a tough one to take down. Right? Thomas Jefferson. They want to take down the Jefferson Memorial. Anybody see the Jefferson? I don’t think we’re moving. I’ll tell you what. If I wasn’t your President, last summer, you may have the Jefferson Memorial taken. Now it may be down. They weren’t playing games. We weren’t playing games either. The George Washington, okay? Here’s the beauty. We want to take down the George Washington Memorial, the monument. Okay? Well this is the commission. This is what we’re dealing with, folks. This is all of it. [inaudible 00:22:20] And wanted to remove the name of George Washington from all of the places all over the country where they use it. Then they found out there’s like 5,000 places. No, we’ll keep the name George Washington if you don’t mind. If the if the media would perhaps put it correctly, a lot of people back there. There’s always a lot of people. You watch those red lights and as soon as I started talking about, the red lights go off because they know what I’m going to say. You know, Joe Biden said nothing when statues of Christopher Columbus were in trouble and a heroic signer of the Declaration of Independence was removed by the Democrat politicians in his home state of Delaware, which he never leaves, in all fairness. Where’s Joe Biden speaking to Delaware? He doesn’t speak. You know what he does? He gets up… How about his news conferences where the fake news media gives him the questions and the answers. They say, “What do you think about this or that?” And then he reads the answer. I’ve been doing this stuff not that long, and I haven’t actually been doing it… Relatively speaking I’ve been doing it for a very short period of time, right? In fact, that’s one of the reasons they said I could never win. They said, “He’s never been a politician.” But the fact is, they gave him the questions, they gave him the answers. They will ask a question and he will read to them the answer. And did you see the other night with George Stephanopoulos? It was like, they call them softballs. And then I had to go on with that person, you know that person. No, she was jumping out of her seat. She was jumping out of her seat. Thank you very much Johnny. Everybody know Johnny? Thank you. He’s very conservative. He’s a big star. And I hate to say this, it’s very incorrect, you don’t say it anymore but the women really like him a lot. Thank you. Normally when I have a hat I like to take the [inaudible 00:24:25] with it, right? [inaudible 00:24:28]. Okay. Thank you, thank you all. So, last week Biden, he attacked Christopher Columbus by refusing to recognize Columbus Day. And he wants to change the name of Columbus Day to Indigenous Peoples Day, who likes that idea? Who likes it? What the heck are you saying? That’s politically incorrect. See what they don’t understand is, they’re politically incorrect. So he wants to change it to Indigenous Peoples Day. Not as long as I’m president, let me just tell you that, okay? But this is what… That’s just a point. But this is what we’re dealing with. This is what we’re dealing with. The radical left is eradicating our history and weak Joe Biden will let them do it. Now what about his vice presidential candidate. Hey, and by the way, by the way, I hope she’s in good shape. Because a number of people in her group have caught COVID, COVID as they say. So we all wish her the best. Do we all wish her best, yes, we do, we do. We hope she’s doing well. But she’s now, I guess, she’s in seclusion, right? How did Mike Pence do against her, right? Come on. Did a great job, right? That was an easy one. I said, “Mike, that was an easy one.” He’s been a great vice president. But he had an easy evening. I said, “Mike, you had an easy evening, that’s not fair.” San Francisco just announced plans for a fascist purge of the names of local schools, erasing the names of Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, and Thomas Jefferson from all schools. What are we going to do about this, huh? It’s local. That’s Nancy Pelosi area, that’s Nancy. I always say, “Nancy, go home and take care of the homeless in San Francisco.” I’ve never seen… So she does, she goes home and takes care of her home, which is a very beautiful home. They even want to erase the names of Democrat senators, and Republican senators, current and past. They want to erase the name of Clinton, yeah, hey, well hey, that’ll be next. That’s a good one. Crooked Hillary will take her name, does she have her name on anything? I don’t know if she’s got her name on anything, right? I don’t know. If she does, I’m all for it, take it down, Crooked Hillary. Are we having a good time? Is there ever a better place to be than a Trump rally? In general though, we don’t call it a rally, because you’re not allowed to have rally because you can’t meet more than two people. They had a number of states, and they had it so that… It was all against me. I think Minnesota. But a lot of them, where you can’t have a rally. And it said, you cannot have groups larger than three people, you cannot have anything to do with politics. You can’t do this, you can’t do that, you can’t do that. I said, “Well wait a minute, so I’m not precluded from ever going to that state and talking to the people?” Which is really bad. They said, “No, you can’t do it.” I said, “Well, is there any exclusion?” “Yes, only protests.” Right? Exclusion is a protest. And they didn’t even use the word peaceful. I do, because I like to make it sound a little… The only thing you could do, is you could protest, you could riot in the streets of Minneapolis, burn down their stores. You could beat the hell out of people. You could do whatever you want. So I said, “I have an idea. Let’s call all our rallies, which we do, peaceful protests.” And now we have legal problem. Because, if we call this a rally, we’d have a problem. So we call it a peaceful protest. So officially, if anyone asks you, like the fake news when you’re walking out, just say, “No, no, this was a peaceful protest, thank you very much.” If you’re a moderate Democrat or Liberal who knows that your party has gone totally off the rails, you have a moral duty to immediately stop this lunacy. You must, by law, join the Republican party. We welcome you to the Republican party, and the party of Abraham Lincoln, you know I can say that. A lot of people don’t know that. It’s the party of Trump, yeah. Well we’ve done a lot, I’ll tell you, we’ve expanded of this party. You see all the… In Michigan and all these places… thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Now you really drive them crazy if you say twelve more years. Twelve. Then they say, “He is a fascist, he is a fascist.” Ah, what a group. Only in Michigan. Only in Michigan. So what do all of the lawless rioters and flag burners have in common is that they’re desperate to try and have a victory with a person that’s totally unqualified, mentally, to be president, okay? He’s unqualified. No, he’s unqualified. Ask yourself this question, do you want to vote for the candidate supported by anti-American rioters, which he is? Or do you want to vote for the candidate supported by the heroes of law enforcement in virtually every instance? Biden will surrender our country to the mob. With your vote, we will save our country from the mob, we will make our country greater than ever before. To ensure that our nation honors the memory of American patriots, I’m establishing a beautiful vast… It’s going to be chosen in the very near future, we have many sites. A vast outdoor park that will feature the statues of all of the greatest Americans who have ever lived. It’s going to be called the National Garden of American Heroes, isn’t that nice? Now you know me from private life. So I’m thinking about calling it the Trump National Garden of American Heroes. Somebody said, “Why didn’t you go with the Trump name?” I said, “No, I don’t think I’ll get away with that one.” To combat the toxic left wing propaganda in our schools I recently announced that we’re launching a new pro-American lesson plan for students called the 1776 Commission. We will teach our children the greatness and glory of America, if they don’t know it. But they’re not being taught that, they’re being taught that we’re not great. I’ve also issued an executive order to prohibit the teaching of critical race theory in the federal government. Critical race theory is a Marxist doctrine, oh you’re so lucky I’m your president, because that was getting out of… No, no. This was getting out of hand. This was getting out of hand. This was getting in the military. This was going all over the place. This was getting out of hand. Critical race theory is a Marxist doctrine that rejects the vision of Martin Luther King Jr, and all of our great forefathers, and instead forces people to judge each other based on race, skin color, and other things that we’re not supposed to be thinking about, we’re not supposed to be, in any way, shape or form, thinking about. Critical race theory teaches that America is an evil country, and that you are part of this oppression from the moment you’re born. I will not allow federal taxpayer dollars to be used to spread anti-American propaganda. And I went a step further, because I ended it for government. And some of these guys were getting paid $350,000 a year to destroy our country, by the way. I ended it. And then I was told that it’s outside of our… It’s really an evil deal going on, and very racist, very racist. And I said, “Well, what’s the problem.” They said, “Well, we have a lot of companies that do business with our country. Defense companies, a lot of big companies.” And I said, “So what’s going on?” “Well they’re teaching it there to.” So I signed another one, just two weeks ago, saying that if you do that you cannot do business with the United States of America. And it was rather incredible how fast all of those people were fired. That was the end of that. But they’re lurking. They’re part of a problem. And they’re lurking out there. They’re smart. They’re plenty smart. We must reject left wing hate and unite as one proud national family. If Sleepy Joe Biden and the Democrat Socialists are elected every citizen in America will be subjected to their extreme ideology, possessed by this Marxist madness. They’ll kill your jobs, dismantle your police departments, dissolve your borders, raise your taxes, destroy your suburb, I saved your suburbs. Women, suburban women, you’re supposed to love Trump. I got rid of the regulation. I can’t believe it, they kill… The fake news keep saying that suburban women don’t like me because they… I don’t sound nice. I don’t have time to be nice, I got a lot of work to do for you. But I think I’m nice, I want to be nice. I want to help people. But no, you had a regulation that will destroy… And it has been over the years. I’ve been watching it for a long time. They want to build low-income housing projects right next to your house. Would you like a nice low-income housing project next to your suburban, beautiful, ranch-style house? Generally speaking, no. Though everybody… He says, “Let Joe live there.” Who said that? No, you did? Very good, I think that’s good. Every once in a while you hear these pearls of wisdom from the audience, because let Joe live there. Joe lives pretty well for a guy that has been a politician all his life. But they want to fund extreme, late term abortion, pack your Supreme Court. Well look, then you got to get out and vote. Of course, based on what I’m reading, Michigan, a lot of you have gotten out and voted. Hey, is that vote still crazy like it was? Is it still… Because I’m just wondering. Maybe it’s just an aberration. It’s early, it’s only been a few days, right? But maybe it’s… That’s a big thing, to me, that’s a big thing. That’s like a poll, and that’s hundreds of thousands of votes, that’s like a poll. You ever see these polls? We have interviewed 83 people. No, it’s amazing. They’re not likely to vote. You’re supposed to interview likely to vote. So they’re not likely. They’re registered. You know what a registered voter is? People that have died 14 years ago are registered, they’re registered to vote, you got plenty of them in Los Angeles. They have many people. They were over 100 years old. Every one of them voted for years. Then they got to be 110, they kept voting, and then people said, “Well this is getting to be record territory.” When you have hundreds of them voting. No, it’s a lot of corrupt stuff going on. But we’re getting it, we’re getting it. But they want to pack the courts, pack the Supreme Court. That’s a big deal. And you won’t have Amy, and you won’t have the great people that we’ve been putting in the court. You’re going to have radical left judges who will become justices. You may have 15, you may have 16, you may have 18, I don’t know. What they want to do is incredible. They want to pick up four votes in the Senate too. You know that right? They want to add to our list of states, you know that right? You have a lot of senators added, you have a lot of congressmen added, you have to rebuild those gorgeous rooms. You’ll have so many seats added. All Democrats, every one of them will be Democrat. You better get out and vote. They want to get rid of the filibuster. They want to use the nuclear weapon, it’s called the nuclear weapon, they want to get rid of the filibuster. And they’ll be able to do whatever they want. So you got to get your president in office, because we’re going to protect your second amendment, we’re going to protect all of the things that you want. But without it, you’re not going to have a second amendment. So while I’m president, I will protect and defend the American way of life always. It’s only going to get better. So we’re joined today by some friends of mine, they’re warriors really, they’re really incredible people. Congressman Jack Bergman. Where’s Jack? Where are you Jack? Great job Jack. Great job. How are we doing? Are we doing okay in Michigan, huh? You’re doing okay too, thank you Jack. Great job. Michigan House Speaker Lee Chatfield. Where’s… Oh, Lee. Young guy Lee. Great reputation. He’s doing a good job. Lee’s good, right? Great reputation, thank you very much. Congressional candidate, somebody really fantastic, I know all about, Paul Young. Paul, thank you. Good job. I heard you’re doing well Paul. Michigan GOP Chair, Laura Cox. Thank you Laura. We winning Laura? Huh? We’re winning. Those are pretty interesting numbers. Did you know that before you came out? That’s a little… Even Laura’s saying, “Boy I’m doing a good job.” Right? And by the way, get out and vote for an outstanding guy, John James, right? He’s outstanding. John James. He is outstanding. I’ll tell you, I spotted him three years ago and he was doing something, and he was in his race, and there were five or six people. I said, “Go back, I want to see that.” And it was John James. And I said, “You know what? That guy’s great, I’ll tell you what.” And then I learned about it, West Point, top student, top everything, great helicopter pilot, is that right? How’s he doing, good? I hear he’s doing better than good. And he’s running against somebody that nobody ever heard of, Peters. Who the hell is Peters, I don’t know. Nobody ever heard of him. No, he’s made a big impact at Washington. He’s a senator from Michigan, and nobody ever heard of him. I don’t know, that’s… But get out for John, and get out for everybody. And these people are incredible. And thank you all for being here, we appreciate it very much, thank you. Also with us is one of your own. We won the state of Michigan, and this woman was brutal. She’d call, “Please, please one more speech, sir. One more speech.” That time she called me Mr. Trump. So the Republicans hadn’t won Michigan in decades, right? And I felt we were doing good in Michigan, right? I felt we were doing good. But when you haven’t won it in 38 years or something, you can feel good but you start to realize, maybe it doesn’t work out. But this woman would call me and she’d say, “You have to come.” And so finally, we’re toward the end. And I said, “Rhona, I’ll do it one more time, but that’s it.” I got a lot of places to visit. I love Michigan, but it hasn’t been won in 36 years. I said, “Rhona, if you don’t mind, okay, I’ll do it one more time.” She said, “That’s all I want.” So I did it. The following day she called up, “You have to come back one more time.” So anyway, so I did. And I went to Grand Rapids, right? And we had 32,000 people. And you know what? That was at 1:00 AM, it was now Election Day, remember? And Crooked Hillary came, and it was unexpected. Say what you want about her husband Bill, he’s a pro, he said, “Be careful of Trump.” That was the first thing. He said, “You don’t want to run against Trump.” And it was, I viewed that as a compliment. They all smiled, they thought it was wonderful. But he said something very interesting. He said, “You better watch Michigan.” Because he was here. He said, “I saw a Trump Pence sign on every lawn.” And he also said, he also said, “You better watch Wisconsin, and you better watch Minnesota.” Now, Minnesota hasn’t been won since 1972, he said watch Minn… And they all laughed at him. First of all, he’s got instinct, he’s a professional, Bill Clinton, whether you like him, don’t like him, I actually sort of… You got to like him, right? But listen, but he said, he said, “You better be careful.” And he came back and said very strongly, “Be careful of Michigan.” And so then, all of a sudden, on the night before the election, they took an unexpected trip. Barack Hussein Obama. Michelle Obama. Oprah. And Hillary, they actually forgot about Hillary. And it was unexpected. And I heard about it. And I said, “Oh, that means that they have a problem.” Because remember, they came here the night before. 500 people showed up. We had 32,000 people show up. Because Rhona, our great Rhona said, “Sir, you got to come.” And we did. And by the time we got here, I started speaking at 1:00 AM, I can’t believe it. But I left and I said, “So let me ask you a question, it’s been many, many years since this. How the hell do you lose if you have 32,000?” Because that’s the ultimate. She said, “You don’t.” That’s right, that’s what happened. And I’ll tell you what, the enthusiasm, and not only in Michigan, but the enthusiasm all over the country is far greater. And it was great four years ago, it’s far greater right now than [inaudible 00:43:44]. So Rhona, great job. Great job. Ted Nugent. Where’s Ted Nugent? Where’s Ted, huh? Look at you. Are you doing well? You are a handsome devil. Thank you. Great job Ted. Thank you very much. Appreciate you being here. We just won a huge victory for voting rights in Michigan, did you hear about it? Ballot harvesting. That’s the old Democrat thing. Ballot harvesting is now illegal as of a short number of hours ago. And ballots must be turned in on November 3rd. Also, known as Election Day. Didn’t they want them turned in a couple of weeks after the election? We’re waiting for Michigan. Oh, well they have a couple go weeks, or the whole country. This is just incredible. But anyway, we had a great decision, a great victory. Thank you. And some of our lawyers are here who represented us so well. Right? Justin and the group. They’re here. Where is he? Where is that great legal team? Because we’ve been having a lot of great victories, the press just doesn’t like writing about it. But this was a great victory in Michigan. This election is a choice between a Trump strong, powerful, beautiful recovery, and a Biden depression. You will have. Because he’s going to raise your taxes, quadruple. You will have the single biggest depression in the history of our country. And I believe that includes 1929. That’s what I believe, okay? They’re going to raise your taxes, put all the regulations back on, force all these companies that moved here and all over our country from all parts of the world, they’re going to all be forced to leave. You’re going to have a problem like you’ve never had before. Because… And you know what they want to do with the money? Fund the Green New Deal, okay? Let’s spend 100… Think of it. Their real price is 100 trillion dollars. 100 trillion, not billion, we’re now into the Ts. So what would happen if you had the best year we’ve ever had, and you had it 100 years in a row, you couldn’t make enough money to pay for that. But this is what they want to do. If you vote for me, prosperity will surge, normal life will fully resume, and that’s all we want. We want normal life like seven months ago. And next year will be one of the greatest years in the history of our country. The Democrats would terminate our recovery with a draconian unscientific lockdown like your governor is doing right now for everybody except for her husband. That’s right. She’s doing it for everybody is locked down except my husband. He can go sailing anytime he wants. A guy like Biden and the Democrats want to keep Michigan locked up, locked down, and closed for business. No, it’s so badly hurting you stay. And then I guess they said she was threatened. Right? And she blamed me. She blamed me and our people were the ones that worked with her people. So let’s see what happens. Let’s see what happens. But I have to tell you something, our FBI has to start looking at Antifa and they have to start looking at some people that they’re not looking at like they should be. Biden will shut down the country, delay the vaccine, and prolong the pandemic and its time. But you know, we won another great case in Michigan, right? It was ruled unconstitutional what she was doing to you. You know, we have the task force, we’ve done a great job. We got to everything. We filled up your cupboard as the expression goes, especially with the ventilators and all stuff that could never have happened. And we have these calls with governors. Mike Pence heads up the taskforce. He did a great job. We have great professionals and we took this thing and we have all the governors, usually 50 governors on the line at one time, and they’re always, “Sir, you’ve a great job. Thank you very much. Great job. Great job. Great job.” Your governor’s down. I mean it’s all down. “Thank you very much. You’ve done a great job on behalf of Michigan. I’d like to thank you, ba, ba, ba.” Then she goes out, speaks to the press, ” We’re very unhappy with the president.” You know, being a real estate developer was much nicer, the people. I used to say, “If you can make it in the world of New York real estate, they’re the toughest people.” Now I call these guys that are friends of mine. Some I can’t stand, but some I like. I say, “You guys are babies compared to what I go through with these maniacs. You’re babies.” No, but it’s true. But she’s saying, “Thank you very much. It’s great. We have everything we need. He gave us 400 trillion goggles. You gave us this. You gave us that. You gave us more anything.” We built hospitals, right? We built hospitals. We did everything. We did things nobody could do. The Army Corps of Engineers and FEMA, the job they’ve done is incredible. And she, and others in all fairness, everybody, they’re all very happy. They are all, every single one, even the real haters, they were happy. And they would say happy. But in her case, and in some others, they would then go on and some were legit. Some were Democrat, some were against Trump, but they go out, they say I did a good job. But she would go out and say, “Great, very happy.” I said, “Is there anything else you want, Governor?” “No, we have everything. Thank you very much. We really appreciate it on behalf of Michigan. Very good.” And then she’d go out and bad mouth me. I mean, it’s incredible. It’s so dishonest. Right? It’s so dishonest. But anyway, hopefully you’ll be sending her packing pretty soon. By the way, and be careful of her and her attorney general, because you know they’re like a judge of the ballot stuff, right? So how the hell do I put my political and our country’s political life in the hands of a pure partisan like that, right? So you got to watch it, watch those ballots, watch what’s going on. You’re more important than any eyes and law enforcement is watching. Okay? They’re watching. Did you see they found 50,000 ballots in like a river? They found ballots in an ashcan. They happened to have the word Trump on them. You know, they’re Trump. They had another group of ballots. They were printed and they forgot two words. Donald Trump. They forgot to put them. Oh, that’s okay. You know, they figured that’s okay. They could write in his name. He’ll be the only one. But no, what’s going on is incredible. And they know it. And you know then they say, they’re taking away… Me, I’m taking away their freedom. Then they say, “If you lose, will you have a friendly transition?” I say, “I want a fair election.” Then they say, ” Will you have a fair… We want a fair and friendly transition.” I said, “Really? Well, when I won, you spied on my campaign, we caught you trying to overthrow the President of the United States. You’re crooked as hell. And we caught you and let’s see what happens to them. But you’re crooked as hell. And to me, that didn’t exactly look like a friendly transition. Would you say, Mr. Congressman, that was not a friendly transition, please.” So anyway. So we’re… The best way, if we could really win this decisively, it would be fabulous. Just decisively. It’s a knockout punch and you know what? We’ll all get back together. Somebody said, “How do you bring the country together?” I said, “It was happening before the China virus came in.” It’s true. I was starting getting in calls from people, the most unlikely people, Democrats, very radical left Democrats. And all of a sudden we had the best employment numbers we ever had. We had 160 million people working. It’s called make America great again. Now I say, “Make America great again, again.” It’s make America great again, again. We’ll have to change those hats. But we had it and people were calling and I’m telling you the country was coming together. And then we had the China virus float in, but this country was coming together because there’s nothing like success. And success was bringing it together and people ask me, “Can it ever get together?” And some people here will be surprised when I say the answer is yes. Success is going to bring us together. And I’m telling you, we were there. We had just signed the deal with China. We had just made the USMCA, Mexico, Canada, great trade deal. Got rid of NAFTA, the worst trade deal ever made. But we were there and calls were being made. And then we got hit with the pandemic with the rest of the world. And China kept it out of the rest of China, but they didn’t keep it out of the world. So we can never forget that. But I’ll tell you what, what keeps us, what will bring us all together is success. It’s going to happen, too. It’s going to happen. Our congressman will be having lunch soon, someday with a radical left, maybe AOC. Do you see yourself? Maybe not. He’s going, “I don’t know about that.” That might be a step too far, right? Omar, he’ll be having lunch with Ilhan Omar who truly hates our country. But she’s one of the reasons we’re going to win the great state of. We’re going to win. We’re going to win because of Ilhan, right? We’re going to win Minnesota because of her. You don’t see having lunch with Ilhan? He refuses. He said, “I don’t care how well we do. I’m not having lunch with her.” Right? Well, he’s a warrior. He knows what he’s doing. I’m delivering a safe vaccine and a rapid recovery. And you see what we’ve done with the vaccines and the therapeutic and the cures. Hey, I’m here. Me. I’m here, right? No, we had great doctors. Walter Reed Medical Center, incredible doctors, Johns Hopkins. One thing when you’re president, they have a lot of doctors. I’m laying in bed, I’m not feeling too great. And I’m looking up and I’m seeing doctors, I just get, please leave me alone. And each one wanted to touch a different part of my body. And I didn’t like that. I said, “Get the hell out of here, doctors.” But we had a drug, brand new, it’s Regeneron and some others make something, several antibodies. And all I know is I went from not feeling too great. Now, who knows. It might’ve been good, it might’ve been… The young people have no problem. And I made the mistake of saying in front of CNN and some of the fakers back there, I said, ” Well, I’ll have no trouble because I’m young. I’m an extraordinary shape. I’m a very great physical.” And, and CNN said, “He lied to the American public. He said he was young. And that he’s in perfect shape.” They can’t take a joke, can they? They can’t take a joke. No, but they made it into a big deal. They always do, you know that? You can’t do anything. I said with the illegal aliens that come in, Biden said, “We’ll give him all Medicare. We’ll give them healthcare. We’ll give him education.” No, what it does is it brings them in. So I said that the Democrats want to give them healthcare, free college education. And everybody that comes in by a certain day, you’ll get a brand new Rolls Royce. And I was kidding, obviously. CNN said, “President Trump lied when he said they were getting a Rolls Royce. He knew they weren’t going to get a Rolls Royce, but he lied.” These are sick people, I’m telling you. Biden’s plan will crush Michigan. My plan will make this state stronger, better in every single way then it ever was before. Joe Biden is the embodiment of the corrupt political class. You see what’s happening right now. And you know what? The lame stream media doesn’t want to write about it. And the giant tech companies, and they’re putting themselves in danger, Section 230, they are putting themselves. Because they’re only existing because the government gave them something that they’ve never given anybody else. And they don’t want it. You could find Joe Biden did the worst crime and they will keep it out of the… It’s the most unbelievable thing. No, it’s the most unbelievable thing what’s going on. And he’s a criminal. He’s committed crimes. For the last 47 years, Biden’s shifted away your jobs, shut down your factories, threw open your borders, ravaged our cities while sacrificing American blood and treasure in these ridiculous, endless foreign wars. They’re all coming home, by the way. In 2016, Michigan voted to fire this corrupt and decrepit political establishment. And you elected an outsider as president to finally put America first, right? America. We’ve spent the last four years reversing the damage Joe Biden and his group inflicted upon us over the last 47 years. He was a cheerleader for NAFTA. Worst trade deal ever made. TPP would have been worse than NAFTA, but I stopped it. And you know what else I stopped? The Paris Environmental Accord. And I liked Prime Minister Macron a lot, but I said, “How’s it going over there? How’s the Accord doing?” They’re not doing too good. Now I saved you trillions of dollars. Nobody else would have done it. When I said, “Oh man, I’m breaking this Paris. I’m getting out of that thing.” That was a disaster. They basically wanted to take our wealth. You can’t use what’s underground. And we have it in other countries down. It was really a terrible thing. And it’s funny. I got out, I terminated it. Got out and the people got it. They praised it. They thought it was fantastic. Except for some of those guys, they thought it was fantastic. Half of all auto manufacturing jobs in Michigan were lost after Biden backed NAFTA and the China disasters, right? World trade. That’s when China became strong, the world trade. One of the great ripoffs of all time. Biden should be asking Michigan workers for your votes. He’s asking you for your votes. You know what he should be asking? He should be asking for your forgiveness. You should forgive them. I would say forgive him. Because even then he had no idea what the hell he was doing. He was never known as one of your smarter senators. Friend of mine said 25 years ago, “Yeah, let’s see. Our dumbest guy? Probably Joe.” I said, “Who’s Joe?” “Joe Biden.” That was 25 years ago. That was prime time. This is no longer prime time. For decades, our politicians spent trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign wars, and defending foreign borders. But now we are finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities, and we are bringing our jobs, our factories, and our troops back home to the U.S.A. Right? I’ll tell you, the spirit, look at the sound. It’s like a great football game, right? Really. No, no, this sound, you don’t hear this anywhere. Moreso, it’s more. This country, we have spirit. And that’s why I’m not so surprised to hear what’s happening. In North Carolina, they say certain areas that are inclined with maybe our thinking like you have to go out and work and love your life and get your kids in school and all of those things. They say the lines are two miles long. They’ve never seen anything like it. The spirit in our country is incredible and that’s happening. That’s going to be happening in Pennsylvania, you watch. It’s going to be happening all over the place. My first week in office, I withdrew from Obama Biden’s Transpacific Partnership, which would have been the death to the American automobile industry. If we had signed that, and you people are affected more than anybody, and I’d always say… And Ohio’s done great and others, but I’d always say, “We got to put these jobs back, these auto jobs back with it because you got 34% of your automobile business was destroyed and shipped to Mexico.” Then I said, “How the hell did anyone let that happen?” And they’d make a car and send it back into our country, sell it. So we lost all the jobs, all the taxes, all the factories, they got everything, they’d sell it. And that’s it. We got nothing. We got nothing. I renegotiated the disastrous Obama Biden trade deal with South Korea that also threatened to devastate your auto industry. And I doubled our auto exports under the deal. That was the Hillary Clinton deal. Remember that? She said, “This deal is great. It’s going to produce 250,000 jobs.” And she was right. You know what? For South Korea, not for us. Didn’t produce anything for us, but it gave them 250,000. So we renegotiated it. You think that was easy? Biden supported the outrageous fuel economy standards that hammered the auto industry. Just ridiculous. Over just a little quarter of a [inaudible 01:01:52] what they had to do. I reversed that rule and helped millions of families afford a safer, better, just a better, more beautiful car. Stronger, safer, heavier. It could be a little bit heavier. Let it be a little bit heavier, safer, and stronger. I ended the NAFTA nightmare and signed the brand new U.S, Mexico, Canada agreement into law. Everyone said that was going to be impossible. And it’s just now kicking in. And I know it’s good because the other two countries aren’t so thrilled. But look, they ripped us off for years and years with that crazy NAFTA. Look at all the empty buildings you had all over from New England to here, all over the place. What a horrible deal that was. The USMCA is expected to create a minimum of 76,000 new automotive… The auto fixers, the automobile jobs, automotive jobs. You have so many of them and they’re all coming. And many of them are coming out of here. And that includes 76,000, we think right here, it’s going to be in Michigan. And we actually think that’s a low number. It could be much higher than that. It includes a lot of wage protections, too. I took the toughest ever action to stand up to China, defending Michigan workers against China’s plunder and theft, and you know what I mean. If Biden wins, China will own America. He’s going to own it. First of all, they pay him a fortune. So why wouldn’t he? He works for China, basically. He works for China. How much money has China… How about Russia? So the mayor’s wife of Moscow gives him three and a half… The son, Hunter, with no experience, no nothing, but they found his laptop. Can you believe this guy? They found his laptop. And they have everything. This is a disaster. They found Hunter’s laptop. Where is Hunter? Where’s Hunter. Hunter’s not doing so well. I called him the Vacuum Cleaner. I changed my name. I used to call him Where’s Hunter. His first name was Where’s Hunter. Now I call them the Vacuum Cleaner. His father goes into a country. He’s right behind him saying, “Give me cash.” That’s what happens. By the way, that’s what happens. Think of it. Ukraine. He got a 183,000 a month, $3 million upfront payment to advise them on energy. What do you know about energy? “Well, I don’t know anything about energy.” Oh, that sounds like a reasonable deal. Even our congressman would take that deal, right? Anybody would take that deal. Is there anybody that wouldn’t take that deal? No. We call him the Human Vacuum Cleaner. Father goes into China. He follows him into China, walks out with a billion and a half dollars to manage, which is millions of dollars a year. I called the head of the biggest wall street firms. It’s probably the smartest guy on wall street. I say, “Can a thing like that happen?” He says, “No, it’s impossible.” Doesn’t even happen to me. And I have the best reputation for investments. It’s a disgrace. And let me tell you, it’s dishonest. And when he tells that… You talk about quid pro quo, I never had a quid pro quo. How about this quid pro quo? ” We’re not going to give you the billion dollars unless you get rid of the prosecutor, get rid of him out of that company.” Which is his son. “Stop investigating my son and stop [inaudible 01:05:12] or I’m not giving you the billion dollars of our money.” And then he goes, boom, the prosecutor was fired and they got the billion dollars and the press refuses to write about it because they are actually equally corrupt. They’re allowing it to happen. They are allowing it to happen and many other things. And many, many other things, okay? Look, it’s all coming up. Many other things, fake news, CNN. CNN is so bad. They can take a great story and make it terrible. They are truly, in my opinion, one of the most dishonest groups of people I’ve ever seen in my life. And by the way, you know what? And their ratings suck. Their ratings suck. Joe Biden is a corrupt politician. And the Biden family is a criminal enterprise and I totally mean it. It’s a criminal… Take a look at the brother, all of a sudden, he’s a big builder in Iraq. How did that happen? How did he get to Iraq? He hasn’t built anything. How’d you get to Iraq to build big developments in Iraq, his brother? He makes Hillary Clinton, I call her Crooked Hillary as you possibly have heard, look like amateur hour. I also authorized millions of… I don’t think they like me too much. I also authorized millions of dollars to save Michigan’s incredible, beautiful, vital, but falling apart, Sioux Locks and fought over. And I had to fight like hell with the Democrats to get it done. And we got $900 million for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. All done. It’s all done. I don’t have to say I’ll do it because it’s all done. And the Locks were in terrible shape. You’re going to lose that very quickly. And we have them. It’s going to be incredible. What we’re doing. They said, “Sir, do you want to do the good job, the okay job, the passable job, a little minor renovation or a great job?” And I said, “Let’s see, it’s Michigan and a couple of other great States. Let’s give him the A-plus job.” And we did. Okay? We gave you the A-plus job. One of the greatest dangers facing Michigan is Biden’s plan to flood your state with refugees from terrorist hotspots, all around the world, including Syria, Somalia, and Yemen. You know that. You know about that, right? It’s in their plan. It’s in the manifesto that he agreed to with Bernie Sanders, crazy Bernie. Greatest loser on earth, Bernie Sanders. He gets beaten every time and he goes right back to work. “I’ll vote for this.” I never saw a guy that could stand being beaten up so badly. He got hammered by the Hillary thing, but he really got hammered this last-All she had to do Pocahontas is leave one day earlier, he would have won every state. And he goes back and he says, “Let’s have dinner, Pocahontas.” Biden has pledged a colossal 700% increase… This is all in writing by the way, increase in the flow of refugees. He will turn Michigan into a refugee camp. Biden has also pledged to terminate all national security travel bans, overwhelm… I got a travel ban that nobody talks about it. But I said, “If a country thinks bad of us, if the people want to blow us up, if the people want to kill us, if the people hate us, I want to travel ban.” Is that so bad to ask? And people fought me. They said, “That’s not nice.” I won. We won. In fact, we won in the Supreme court. We won in the Supreme court, now we keep people that hate us out of our country. We won in the Supreme Court. Now we keep people that hate us out of our country. Biden wants to, he wants to give up the travel ban. He wants to knock down the… you know the wall is almost complete. Over 400 miles. And we have the strongest Southern border now we’ve ever had. And it’s incredible what we’ve done on the Southern border. Biden wants to knock down the wall. That’s what we hear. They said, “Do you want to knock down the wall?” I don’t think he even knew what the hell they were asking him. Doesn’t matter what he wants, it’s what his handlers want. They want to overwhelm Michigan with poorly vetted migrants from jihadist regions. Well, Omar wants that to happen. AOC wants that to happen. Ilhan Omar, she’s not happy with our country. She’s not happy with our country. She wants to tell us how to run our country. Take a look at that. She wants Ilhan Omar. But I like her very much because dammit, Minnesota, you better vote for me. If that, plus the riots, where they took down Minneapolis, we saved it. We sent in the National Guard. We saved it. Well, it took them the better part of a half an hour. They could have called about two weeks earlier. And I would love to go into Portland, because first of all, Seattle, we said, “We’re going in.” And we were going in the next morning and they all said, “We’ll going to leave now. Thank you very much.” But we’re not supposed to. What we’re supposed to do is they’re supposed to ask us. And we want the governor of Oregon, Portland, we want the governor of Oregon to call us. We will solve that Portland problem in a period of, would you say a half an hour, or less? Wasn’t that beautiful? In Minneapolis, they came in, these soldiers wore the most expensive helmets in the history of mankind. You approved them. They had more computers. They have everything. They could look at somebody and the somebody is gone. But they came in Bom, Bom, Bom. You saw one, two, three black outfit. Then all of a sudden you had a second row and a third row and a fourth. And they had their tear gas and they had their pepper spray, which the other side doesn’t want to use because it’s not nice. They can throw cans at you and they can throw rocks and stones and hurt your police, but you’re not allowed to guard yourself with tear gas, pepper spray, which 100% are effective. So they just marched forward. And the whole thing was over. It was like… it was over. I don’t know, there’s something about that, when you’re watching everybody getting pushed around. There’s something very beautiful about it. I don’t care what anyone says. Not politically correct. I’ll be on, they’ll say, “He thinks that that was beautiful.” But you people get it. You get it probably better than I do even, right, when you get right down to it. But what they’re doing will not only undermine your security, but it will overcrowd your hospitals and divert needed resources for low-income communities that we’re all for. We want to help people. We want to help our citizens. Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure border in US history. And when the wall is finished, which will be very soon, we are going to have a great, big, beautiful celebration. And with that wall, by the way, we’re keeping out terrorists, extremist, violent criminals, rapists, murderers. And we also, I have to say, our border patrol and ICE have done an incredible job. You know, ICE has removed thousands, thousands of MS-13 out of our country. And not a lot of people want that job. That’s a tough job. That’s a day. You got to be a certain type of person. You don’t want it, this handsome guy with the sunglasses. You don’t want it. He doesn’t want to be a member of ICE. They go into what they call a nest and the fists are flying and everything. And then they walk out and that’s the end of that. No, these guys are tough and smart and you know what? They love our country. And we love them, too. We invested $2.5 trillion in the United States military. We have the greatest equipment any nation has ever had. When I came, a highly overrated general told me, “Sir, we have no ammunition.” We maybe had to do something. “We have no ammunition, sir.” I said, “No president should ever hear that again.” Anyway, we spent $2.5 trillion and we have the greatest equipment, missiles, rockets, tanks, planes, fighter jets, ships, tankers, bombers. We have the greatest equipment. We have, I call it the super-duper missiles that go very fast, hydrosonic. Super-dupers, they go five to seven times faster than the fastest missile in the world. They go so fast you can’t do anything. And by the way, our nuclear is rebuilt, replenished. And here’s what you have to do. We had no choice. It was not in good shape. Hope to God, we never have to use any of this equipment, okay. And the best way you don’t have to use it is if you have it, okay. But we have the best ever that we’ve ever had. All made in the USA, by the way, every ounce of it. And we launched the first new branch of the US Armed Forces in 75 years, United States Armed Forces, 75 years, think of it, the Space Force. Which people, really, look, a couple of them made the statement, whether you like them or not, I made promises during the campaign, but some of them say I actually produced more than the promises I made, as opposed, most politicians never keep their promises. But think of it, Space Force. I never talked about Space Force. I realized after being here for a year and a half, I said, Russia’s doing big stuff out in space. China’s doing big. I said, “We got to have a Space Force.” They were not happy when this happened, but we got it through Congress. Thanks to your congressmen and various other people. We did a good job. Thank you, man. We did a good job. We have Space Force and it’s going to end up being one of our most important, without question. I withdrew from the last administration’s disastrous Iran nuclear deal, $150 billion for nothing. Here’s 150 billion. 1.8 billion in cash. I’m even more impressed with that. Think of it. Cash. $1.8 billion they got. Ane we got nothing. We got nothing. In fact that agreement’s almost going to expire if we didn’t terminate it, which we did. I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. 52 years, they Were working for it. 52 years, they’d come in every year. They’d fly in with those beautiful jets and everybody would come in and they’d have lunch. And they’d talk two or three days, then they’d leave. 52 years that went on. I did it in about two hours. Golan Heights. And instead of endless war, we are forging peace in the Middle East. No blood on the sand. No blood. No blood. I did more in 47 months, then sleepy Joe Biden did in 47 years, which is true. Now the Democrats are pushing the most far left agenda ever put forward by a presidential nominee. The Biden plan would destroy social security and destroy protections for pre-existing conditions. His running mate co-sponsors a socialist healthcare plan to ban private insurance. A lot of you have private insurance. We have 180 million people and they love their private insurance and they want it. They don’t want to go into a hospital ward when they have a cold, they want to have their private insurance and they want their doctor and they want their plan. And Obama said that, “You can have your doctor and you can have your plan.” And he said it 28 times and he lied. Biden also supports abolishing school choice and charter schools. It’s not going to happen. In a second term, I will provide school choice to every parent in America. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans. It’s a vote for the American dream. That’s what we’re doing. And in conclusion, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we will end our reliance on China once and for all. We will hire more police and thank you to law enforcement for being here. You’re all over. We love our police. Thank you. Thank you. We have a lot of law enforcement here. I said to Biden during the debate, I said, “Name one law enforcement group that supported you.” And Chris Wallace bailed him out. Then I said, “Say the words law and order.” Just law and order nothing fancy, law and order. We just want law and order. Everybody wants that. And he said, “He didn’t want to get involved.” And then Chris Wallace bailed him out again. I said, “No, no, no, you can’t do that.” Because I was really debating two people. No, I was really debating one, Chris Wallace. But I said, “Name it, name it.” Then I think he said, didn’t he say something like, “Oh, law order and safety and security,” and all this. He wanted to soften it up because the radical left will throw him overboard with that. No, I said, “Say law and order.” But he couldn’t do it, but he got bailed out. But we’s going to increase penalties, so assaults. If you take a look at what’s going on with assaults, we are going to take care of our police. And when they do bad things to our police, the people that do it are going to suffer the consequences. I think I have every police group in the nation. In fact, they had down as part of the script, I was supposed to read them. I said, “I can’t read that long.” I would have been reading here all day long. We literally have every police group in the nation. We even got the endorsement of New York City Police. They’ve never done it before. We got the endorsement of Chicago Police. And that’s tough because, they never did it. We’ve got every law enforcement. We’ve got Florida, Texas. We’ve got everybody. They’re all with us. We do have New York, that’s right. But I just want to thank them because they’re incredible. And they take a lot of abuse and they don’t realize it, the people of our country love them. Just realize it. And we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. Get them out of here. Nobody wants them. The only one’s want them are the politicians. The people in California don’t want them. The politicians want them. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms, second amendment. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens and we will keep America out of endless, ridiculous foreign Wars of places you’ve never even heard of. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might and we will ensure peace through strength. We will end surprise medical billing, that surprise medical billing is a bad deal and it’s now ending, require price transparency, all signed up. Goes into effect January 1. Can you imagine if the sleepy guy gets in and it’s January 1, and everybody says this price transparency, I’ll tell you what, it’s bigger than healthcare. Wait’ll you see. It’s bigger than healthcare, you talk about pricing, bigger. And can you imagine, and he’ll get credit for it. They’ll say, “Biden did a phenomenal job on price.” People have been trying to get this thing for 25 years. I got it done in January. I said to my people, “Couldn’t you do it like from six, seven months ago.” But they had statutory limits. You had to wait here, there, that. So on January 1, I better damn well be president, I’ll tell you. Well, I will be. I will be. Yeah, for 20 days. Don’t do this to me. Don’t do it that. You can’t do that. No, no. So January 1, it goes into effect. We go out to January 20th. But you know what? I honestly believe, I don’t think we’re going to have to worry about it. I think we’re going to have price transparency. We’ll be here for four years. And then if we decide to go for an extra four or eight. 12, I think 12 is going to be now the gold standard. Hey, that’ll be the new chant. And the other thing we’re doing, as you know, is to further reduce the cost of prescription drugs. We’ve reduced it the first time in 51 years anyone’s got. But now we’re talking a big because I’ve instituted a favored nations laws. And I also got rid of the middlemen. The middlemen were making a fortune and yesterday I said, “I’ll bet you,” right, “I’ll bet you Hunter Biden is a middleman, too.” These middlemen have made a fortune. They make more money than the drug companies, the middlemen. It’s all because of horrible legislation and crazy things. And we’re thinking that probably Hunter Biden got a big piece of the action, too, for his father. Did you see the letter where the father is supposed to get 10% of everything? The father’s, he’s running for president. He is a national security risk. We will strongly protect Medicare and social security. And we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. And that’s very exciting. And all of that is happening. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. That’s happening. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, in God we trust. They’re not going to remove it. For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of Michigan. And I’ve been doing that long before I even thought about running for office. It’s true though, when I came here, I don’t know, 10, 12 years ago, it was always my number one issue. How come our country is being ripped off so badly by other countries. So I’m probably here because of Michigan, maybe more than any other race if you think about it. So get your friends, get your family, get your coworkers, get your boss, if you have a boss and he’s a little lazy, say, “Boss, you get your ass out of that chair and get out and vote.” Get out and vote. This is the most important election in the history of our country, the most important. And I never thought I’d say that after our last victory. This is the most important election we’ve ever had. Send in your absentee ballots if you have requested one. Or you can vote early by going in and casting your absentee ballot in person. Just make sure you vote and make sure your ballot is counted. You’re dealing with a very tricky, smart, group of people. From Lansing to Mackinaw, from Pontiac to Saginaw, from Kalamazoo to right here in Muskegon. Great place. We inherit the legacy of Michigan Patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for this beloved nation. This is the state where Henry Ford invented the assembly line. Think of that. Think of that. Great things happened in this state. It’s a place where General Motors, Chrysler, Kellogg, revolutionized entire industries. Amazing. When you think of what Michigan has done, Michigan gave us Motown, gave us the Mustang and gave us the unrivaled might of the American Midwest. Think of that. Think of what Michigan, Michigan is something very special. We made America into the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And the best is yet to come. You watch. It’s going to come. Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. That’s what we’re doing. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God, and together with the incredible people of Michigan, we have made America powerful again. We have made America wealthy again. Look at our stock market. Look at that market. Look at your 401ks. How are you 401ks doing, huh? You want to see them crash? Vote for sleepy Joe. You’ll have 401ks, they’ll be worth, there’ll be lying right in that floor. You’ll throw them away. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again. We have made America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, Michigan. Go out and vote.
















"
"89","10-18-20","What a crowd, what a crowd. You see what’s going on in the road? All the way up here. We have people all the way up. It was never like that for the last administration, they tell me. I’ll ask the guys that happened to be with me, they were winning the last one too. They don’t say much. I said, “Was it like that?” They said, “Sir, nothing was like that. Nothing.” It was never like that. And they’ve got the Trump signs and the flags and the American flags all over the place. All those American flags. Thank you very much. Hello, Carson City, hello. It’s great to be back in Nevada with the thousands of loyal, hard working American patriots, great people. Can you believe it? 16 days? 16 days. And you know what, 16 days from now, we’re going to win the state of Nevada. We’re going to win four more years in the White House and we’re going to keep it going. Early voting is underway. So get out and vote. And they’re getting a little worried because certain areas … we know we’re going to have a big red wave. We’re going to have a tremendous … they know it. These fakers back there, they know it. They know it. All you have to do is look at this crowd. When did we set this up, like two days ago? “We’ll be in Carson City in about two days,” and the people come out like crazy. And the people in the road, thousands and thousands because they couldn’t get in. It’s pretty sad when you take an airport and it’s not big enough, right? “Sir, we have a problem. We have an airport, it’s not big enough.” But you know what’s happening. So we have the big red wave is going to happen. And that’s going to happen on November 3rd and a little before for the voting. But you can get out now, right Michael? They can get out now and they can vote? But you know, strange things are happening in North Carolina. A lot of people are out there voting, those lines are miles long. They’re miles long. And they’re wearing a lot of red caps. They’re wearing caps and they’re wearing badges and they’re wearing those beautiful shirts. A lot of them, they love our country. They work so hard. But they weren’t into voting for a long time. Then about four years ago, they went out and now they’re out. And I think even more so. There’s even more enthusiasm now than we had four years ago. Actually it’s hard to believe. And I’ll say it for the fake news, by a lot. I’ll give you an example, Michigan. In Michigan, we’re supposed to be like probably 80/20 with us on the back, but we’re going to catch them. Everyone’s expecting we’re going to do well. We should with all the auto plants being built in Michigan, hadn’t been built for 42 years. And now they’re building them all over the place. A lot of jobs. They had the best year they ever had. Michigan had the best year. They have a governor that’s got it locked down, but now we forced it to open up. They ruled unconstitutional what she’s doing. But here’s what’s happening. So in Michigan I was supposed to be … they’re going to take the big lead. Then like a racehorse, then we’re going to catch them with a big red wave because our people like to go and vote. They like to go and vote. But something strange is happening in and Michigan. It’s happening in other places too. But it’s happening in Michigan because we’re not at 20%, we’re leading in the early vote. That’s never happened. That’s never happened before for the Republicans. It doesn’t work that way. Now in all fairness, until I won Michigan four years ago, Michigan hadn’t been won in decades, many decades by a Republican. But we won it, and now we should win it by even more because everything I said that would happen, happened. All the plants, all the good economy and everything. Until the China virus came and the plague, the plague from China. And how do I look? Okay? Do I look okay? Thank you. Thank you. We can do things today that we couldn’t do. We can do things today we couldn’t do seven months ago when we got hit with this thing. The whole world got hit with it. They should have kept it in. They could have kept it in. They protected their country, but they didn’t protect the world or us, Europe. And we will never forget. We will never forget. We had just signed an incredible trade deal. The ink wasn’t dry. And then we got hit by the plague. But we will not forget. But we were doing numbers the likes of which we’ve never done before, 160 million people employed. You had the best year you ever had. But almost all states. I can say it, I don’t have to do a lot of research, almost every state was having the best year they ever had. And then we closed it up and we saved over 2 million lives by doing what we did. They don’t like to say that. We did a great job. We’re now doing the vaccines, they’re coming out very soon, very strong, great companies, Johnson and Johnson, Pfizer, Moderna, great companies. A lot more than that. But they also have a lot of other things. And they call them therapeutics. For me, it was a cure. I mean, what’s the difference. I say, “Give me a definition.” Because I wasn’t feeling … I wasn’t like, “Oh gee, I feel great.” I hate to admit, I didn’t feel … I haven’t been somebody that’s had a lot of problems with that stuff. So I hate to admit it, but you know what? I was not feeling great. Does that make sense to you? I wasn’t exactly feeling the best. But the great thing is when you’re president, you have so many doctors. I was saying to a group this morning, I said, “I had so many … I had 12 doctors around the bed. And everyone was grabbing a different part of my body.” [inaudible 00:00:08:47]. And they’re all super geniuses. But I was not feeling good. And then they me this Regeneron, which is an antibody. And great company, great, great company. Tremendous success with cures, vaccines, other things. And they actually came up with the Ebola drug, which just saved so many lives. They came up with a lot of good stuff. And the other one’s too, but this was one I liked because it just seemed to have a very good record. But it was brand new. Hadn’t been tested. Hadn’t been approved or anything. By the way, we’re approving it for everybody that needs it free of charge because it wasn’t your fault. And Eli Lilly makes a drug based on the same concept. Eli Lilly, great company from Indiana, great state. Great state because I won it by a lot. You know, every state that I win by a lot or win by a little, we’re happy with. And by the way, we’re leading in the state of Nevada. You better get out of [crosstalk 00:09:52]. Why wouldn’t we win? But anyway, I took this drug. I wasn’t feeling good. It’s a transfusion, as they say. Like one hour. And the next day I felt like Superman. I got up, I said, “What the hell is going on?” I felt like Superman. I said, “Come on, bring them on, bring them on whoever it is.” No, I felt good. And I could have left. I wanted to leave the hospital then. They said, “Sir, can we have a couple of more days, please?” But these doctors are great. I love you, too. I love you, too. Thank you. Appreciate it. Thank you. But these doctors are great. And we can do things today seven months ago, it was unheard of really. The whole antibody thing was … What they’ve done is incredible, with the therapeutics and all of the vaccines that you’re going to see coming on board right now. So, I say you get out there and things are opening up, tell your governor to open up, tell everybody to open up. I told Michigan. Michigan, we sued and they found her … it was unconstitutional. The only person that her state was opened up for was her husband. He was allowed to go and sail his boat, do whatever the hell he wanted to, but nobody else could do anything. They were like locked into prison. And it’s very bad. That causes a lot of problems. That causes with the alcohol and drugs and depression and suicide, believe it or not. And the cure can not be worse than the problem itself. So it can’t be, right? It can’t be. So if you vote for me, and you know what’s going to happen … Let me change it, when you vote for me … So we have a lot of people here. Is there anybody that’s going to vote for sleepy Joe in this crowd please raise your hand. Not too many. Not too many. Sleepy Joe. I can’t even believe it. He should have never even gotten a nomination. It was Bernie’s for nomination until Elizabeth Warren Pocahontas split up the vote. But let’s change it. When you vote for me, prosperity will surge. Your taxes will be cut even further. And I gave you the biggest tax cut in the history of our country. The pandemic is rounding the turn. And we have the vaccines coming and they go crazy, the fake news. But I will tell you, it’s rounding the turn with or without, it’s rounding the turn. You’ll see that. Normal life, that’s all we want. We want normal life. We want normal. We want to be where we were seven months ago, right? We’ll fully resume the Nevada tourism and hospitality industry, which is fantastic. We’ll come roaring back. And it will. And next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country for everybody. Unless somebody like sleepy Joe Biden wants to substantially increase your taxes and your regulations. We cut your regulations. Used to take up to 21 years to get a highway approved. Can you believe it? 21 years. You ever see the big charts where it showed you have to go here, here, here, then back. Take years and years, it could be 21 years. And then they get … not only that, 21 years and then they’d disapprove it. How would you like to have that job? After 21 years, you’re going for a vote and then you lose three to two and that’s the end of that. So a big portion of your life was trying to get something approved. And we have it down to two years. I think I’ll have it down to one year. And it may be disapproved if it’s environmentally not good, if it’s unsafe. But it’s going to be one year, two years. And most likely it will be approved and it will get done. He wants to terminate our new found energy independence, and that’s what he wants to do. He wants to end fracking. Do you ever see this guy? For a year and a half, “There will be no fracking, no fracking, no fracking.” Then he goes to a great place, Pennsylvania. And they say, “By the way, we have a million jobs for fracking.” “Oh, we will have fracking. We will have it.” And the fake news doesn’t even talk to him about it. They don’t ask him like, “Well, how come for a year and a half you said there’s no fracking. And then as soon as you get the nomination, you say there’s fracking?” Remember Hillary? She said, “No coal. No clean coal. No coal. Forget it.” Then three weeks later, she had to go to … No, him up, you mean him up because you see what’s happening with Biden? He is corrupt politician. But did you see Hillary? And then she goes to West Virginia and she said, “Oh, well actually I like coal,” but it was a little bit too late. It was a little bit too late. She you’ve got record low numbers. West Virginia, great place. They don’t like it when somebody says you can’t dig coal. That was not good. But Biden wants to launch a socialist takeover of healthcare to cut our military budget. And he wants to cut it right to the bone. Well, the Democrats do not like our military. Traditionally, we have built a greatest military. Anytime that we’ve ever had, anywhere in the world. If you vote for Biden, he will surrender you jobs to China. He will surrender your future to the virus. He’s going to lockdown. This guy wants to lockdown. He’ll listen to the scientists. If I listened totally to the scientists, we would write down, have a country that would be in a massive depression. Instead of we’re like a rocket ship, take a look at the numbers. And that’s despite the fact that we have five or six of these Democrats keeping their state closed because they’re trying to hurt us on November 3rd. But the numbers are so good anyway, they’d be even better. But New York should be open. Michigan now has to open because of the court case. North Carolina should be open. They should be open. You guys, you want to open. Yeah, you want to open. Pennsylvania has to open. We have places and sometimes they’re open, but they’re partially open. They’re not open like they should be. Get the places open. Let’s go. Let’s go. But he’ll surrender your country to the radical socialist left. You see that happening. This election is a choice between a Trump super recovery, which we’re in right now or a Biden depression. You will have a depression. First of all, your taxes are going to be quadrupled. You will have a depression the likes of which we have not seen since 1929. that’s what’s going to happen. And I’m very good at those things. You will have one of the great depressions of all time. Your taxes are going to go up. Your regulations are going to go up. Everybody’s going to be leaving our country. All those jobs and companies that I brought in, they’re all going back to where they came from. All he wants to do is raise it. Even in the companies. Who wants to raise it for the companies so they go back to another location? They came because we cut taxes. Now he wants to raise their taxes. They will leave. It’s very simple. It’s one of those things. It’s a choice between strong borders or no borders, between supporting the police or defunding the police, between delivering a vaccine in record time to kill the virus or a Biden shutdown to kill the economy. On November 3rd, vote for jobs, safety, lower taxes, a secure second amendment and freedom. There’s a lot of people here. Look at that. A lot of people. I wish the cameras would show it. They never show it, right? They never show it. They show me. And you know what happens over my shoulders, about three or four people. They’re always complaining, “I don’t see masks.” There’s a lot of masks on. A lot of masks. No, they’re corrupt people. But Joe Biden is from a failed and corrupt political class that enriched itself while draining the economic life and soul from our country. Guy’s been here for 47 years. Isn’t it amazing? I do something, he says, “Oh, I would’ve done it …” He’s been here for 47 years. Now, all of a sudden he says, “Oh, we should have done this.” When I closed and put a ban on China coming and heavily infected, I saved thousands, probably hundreds of thousands of lives. He said I was xenophobic. I shouldn’t have done it. Months later, he agreed it was the right thing to do. Now he goes out, I should have done it sooner. And yet he didn’t want me to do it months later. These people, I don’t know how they get away with it. You know why? Because those people are more corrupt than anybody. They don’t even ask him. They don’t even ask him. For the last 47 years, they shipped away your jobs, shut down your factories, let drugs pour into our country and all over our great communities. And they ravaged our cities while sacrificing American blood and treasure in endless, ridiculous foreign wars in countries that you never even heard of. By the way, they’re all coming back. They’ve been coming back. People don’t like to hear it. People don’t like to report it. They’re coming back rapidly. He’s a servant of the wealthy donors, globalists, and special interests who got rich bleeding, America dry and putting America last. As your president, I could have been the greatest fundraiser of all time. You know, you see these numbers that they raise. They raise 300 million. You know why? When they raise money, that’s a deal. They’re making deals. I would be the single greatest fundraiser in history. I’ll call up the head of Goldman Sachs, I’ll call up the head of all these Wall Street guys. Most of them I know or know enough about. I know them all. I know them. I know too much. And I could call up, “Listen, do me a favor. Would you give 10 million to my campaign?” “Yes. Mr. President.” “Would you give 20 million …” “Yes …” But when you do that, you don’t have to say anything. When they call you in three months and they say, “We need help with this or that or that.” It’s very hard, like sort of almost morally. They did for you. And you do for them. It doesn’t have to be a deal or a quid pro quo like he had with the billion dollars to get his son out of problems with the prosecutor. And they never ask him about that either. But I would be the greatest fundraiser of all time, but I don’t like to do that because it puts us at a disadvantage and we never want to be at a disadvantage. So easy though, think of it. The president calls, they’ll give me whatever the hell I want. In 2016, you voted to fire this corrupt and decrepit political establishment. And you elected an outsider as president who is finally putting America first. Joe Biden is and always has been a corrupt politician. He always has been. And as far as I’m concerned, the Biden family is a criminal enterprise. It really is. Look at what’s going on. I don’t know what’s going on with the Democrats, they’re a very powerful party. But it’s not the Democrats. It’s the Democrats plus the fake news media. And then it’s also including big tech. Here it is. It’s me. I’m all you have between your second amendment and chaos and all the problems. It’s me. I’m all you have. And the Republicans, I love the Republicans and we have some great, but they have to learn to stick together better. We have some stupid people. We have some stupid people. Some of them are gone. Flake, Corker, they’re gone. But now we have this guy, Sasse, wants to make a statement. Little Ben, little Ben Sasse. The Republicans have to stick together better. You don’t see that. One thing I respect about the Democrats, they stick together. They have lousy policy. They want open borders. They want sanctuary cities. They want to quadruple your taxes. But the one thing is they stick together. The Republicans have to learn. They got to stick together. And by the way, it’s been that way for decades. I don’t know what the hell is in the blood. Could you explain that to me please, Michael? Huh? What the hell is going on? Ah, what the hell is going on? It’s been that way for many decades. I don’t know. There’s always a few. They want to make a statement. Jesus. It’s just a bunch of wimps. [inaudible 00:24:13] No, I love them. They’ve been great. Hey look, on the impeachment hoax, I couldn’t do better. The 197 to nothing in the House Republicans. And we even had the Democrat or two come and join us, right? That was an impeachment over a telephone call that was perfect, other than that. Think of that. But 197 to nothing and with the Senate, 52 and a half to a half. Who was the half? I can’t think of it. Oh, Biden couldn’t think. He couldn’t remember the name. Right? He couldn’t remember the name. Look, you know, the guy from, I think he was a governor. I’m not sure or now what, is he a Senator now? What’s his name? Mitt Romney. That’s right, oh that’s… He didn’t remember Mitt, which I thought was insulting to Mitt Romney. I wouldn’t insult Mitt Romney that way. Okay? But Biden couldn’t remember his name. You know, they’ve only known each other for about 35 years. Look, Biden is gone. Let’s not kid ourselves. We want to be nice. Biden is gonzo. Can you imagine having Kamala? Most liberal member of Congress. The most liberal member of Congress. And I think that whole thing, that’s why Nancy Pelosi is talking about the 25th amendment. That’s the real reason. They want to get him the hell out. The Bidens make crooked Hillary Clinton looked like an absolute amateur. That’s true. And she’s pretty bad. And I do want to hear from law enforcement. Why aren’t they looking at, and maybe they are, and I hope they are. You know, I try and stay out of it because I’m trying very hard to be so right down the middle. But why aren’t they looking at the fact that she got a subpoena from the United States Congress for 33,000 emails and she deleted every single one of them and then acid washed them. And then she pounded her telephones with a hammer. I’ve gotten rid of cell phones and I throw them away. You know. Now I throw them into the Secret Service, okay? I give them back. But before this, I throw them away. I get a new one, right? She pounded the crap out of them with a hammer. How many people have gotten rid of your cell phones and pounded them to death with a hammer? So I just want to know why aren’t they looking at that? Why aren’t they looking at that? Why aren’t they looking at Omar? Omar. Ilhan Omar. But the biggest of them all is Joe. He’s corrupt. And they found the laptop. You know what they call that? The laptop from hell. That is a laptop. That’s a laptop from hell. Let’s see what happens with it. Let’s see what happens with it. So a giant trove of emails show Hunter Biden making deals, setting up meetings with his father Joe, and using the office of the Vice President for a for-profit cash machine. That’s what it is. This guy is a vacuum cleaner. He follows his father around and takes millions, hundreds of millions and billions of dollars out of these countries. I mean, that is so dishonest. That’s so crooked. I call him the human vacuum cleaner, right? You know those things on television. He’s better than any one of them. Joe Biden said he knew nothing, but he lied, because I’m telling you, this laptop is a disaster. The fake news and big tech don’t want to write about it though. They don’t want anything to do with it. And they punish. And thank you to the New York Post. It’s unbelievable what they’re doing. You know, it’s the fifth or fourth largest newspaper. So you’d call it the mainstream, not the lame stream, but the mainstream media. But it’s the, I guess the fourth largest. It’s the oldest newspaper in the U.S. I think it was Alexander Hamilton founded it. Right? And they should be very proud of what they’re doing because the New York times refuses to write about it. And the fake Washington Post, which is a total fake, you know that’s a lobbyist for Bezos on the group, okay, for Amazon, but he calls it the lobbyist. He must call it that. I call it the lobbyist. Okay? You own the Washington post, you have a little power. It’s a free lobbyist. Although it’s probably not a free one. It probably costs him a fortune, but it gives him what he needs. But it’s fake. And if you look at it, NBC and MSDNC, right? And if you look at ABC. How about Stephanopoulos the other day? You know, he interviewed me two weeks ago. He gave me a tough interview, but I didn’t consider it unfair. Although it turned out the audience was stacked against me, you know. There were some Trump people and some Biden people, and some, well no, it didn’t work out that way. Did it? And actually they were very nice, right? The one woman said how handsome I was. You know, the one woman… No, it’s true. I’d rather have that. I’d rather have that than have her say, “You’re a wonderful politician.” The hell with that. I’d rather have her say. What’s better than that? Right, Michael? He’s so handsome. You have such a great smile. But see here’s what happened with her. She was so nice. But she was supposed to be like, I think a former Hillary supporter, but the way she said it to me, it was so nice. And then after the show, and she said it right, did anyone see that? It was so lovely. And then after the show, she went rogue. I wouldn’t vote for him. In other words, they said, “Wait a minute, this isn’t the deal here. What are you doing?” I’m sure that the Democrats together with their partner, ABC television network said, what the hell happened with her? That’s a terrible thing that she did. So I’m sure they hit her very hard and she got back in line. Okay? But I think hopefully her first statement was the statement she believed. He’s a handsome man. See, now the fake news will say, “President Trump went on a rant talking about how handsome he is.” They don’t understand. He went on a rant. It was a terrible thing. We don’t think he’s handsome. Actually, they think I must be the most unattractive human being they’ve ever seen. Except what they don’t realize is without me, they will have ratings that will nosedive. They’ll go out of business, every one of them. Right? Right? You know, I’m making this speech a little bit longer, then I’m looking at this crazy Nevada sun. And I’m sitting here with this white skin. But who the hell cares if I get a little sunburn, right? They don’t want to write about or report on this scandal because they want Biden to win. You know, I’ve always said, in the end, they’re going to all endorse me because if Biden wins, they’re out of business. This is the most boring human being I’ve ever seen. But they want Biden to win so they can take over our country because they will take it over, between big tech, section 230, by the way. All right, go ahead. No, no, no, no. No, it’ll be one of the great, it’ll be one of the great disasters. I’m telling you, depression, just remember the word. And you know it. And California, are you from California? You do. You do. You do. Come on, Gabe. Let’s go, Gabe. Come on, Gabe. You know, I just left. I’ll tell you what. So I just left California. And I was in a place that was sort of Republican. But I was with a wonderful reporter. I just spoke to him, from the Washington Times, which is a really good newspaper by the way. And he reported very strongly, the crowds were unbelievable. Unbelievable. And I don’t know why we wouldn’t win California. We’re playing it a little bit. In theory, you’re not supposed to be able. But they have everything against them, high crime, homeless. They don’t take care of the homeless. I tell Nancy Pelosi, come back to San Francisco and take care of your homeless, Nancy. The endless forest fires. They’re endless. I do. I like the governor, but I said, do you ever stopped with these forest fires? Can you ever stop? They got to manage the forest. You know? They talk, it’s all sorts of reasons. They’ve got to manage the forest. Manage it. It’s called forest management. But they got to stop. They got to stop. And now they have a new thing. They’re running out of water. And you know, they’ve run out of electricity. They have brownouts, blackouts. And a lot of people are leaving. They’re leaving for Texas. They’re leaving for Texas. They’re leaving for Florida. They’re leaving for places that are really well-read. But it’s very interesting, a big thing the other day. They’re going to ration their water in California. And I felt so badly. I called up, I said, “Oh, do you have a drought?” “No.” You know they do? Millions of gallons an hour come down from the north, pour down, pour down. So they have so much, right? They have so much water. But they route it into the Pacific ocean because they have a smelt. Right? Is it a smelt? How’s that for a memory, good? There’s no problem there. Smelt. It’s a little tiny fish. And it’s been having difficulty over the last long time with water, without water. It’s having difficulty. But they want to save the smelt. And in saving the smelt, they’re destroying human lives. Right? And they’re destroying the farmers, and even Los Angeles, the homes. So they have a thing where they’re bringing it down ultimately to 42 gallons a person. And it sounds like a lot. Look, if somebody said you could have 42 gallons a person, I think a day, it sounds like a lot of water, right? It’s not. It’s like a quick shower and let’s wash your hands. Then they have a mandate, wash your hands at all times. You must always constantly wash. Then they say 42 gallons. Say, wait a minute. Okay. I got a deal. I won’t take a shower for the next couple of weeks, but I’ll wash my hands. No, it’s true. So 42 gallons, it sounds like a lot, but it’s really not. Friend of mine, he has this massive house. He says, “I’m not going to be able to take a shower. I live in a house, this gorgeous house, right?” He can’t take a shower. Wash your hands every hour, every 15 minutes. You know what I did? I’ll tell you this crazy story. So, you know what bothers me. When you go into a new hotel or new house, they have these faucets, right? And you turn them on, no water comes out. Even if you live in like North Carolina, you live in areas where up in New England, you live, most of our country has so much water we don’t know what to do with it. The problem is how do you get rid of it? But they do for like they desert, like here, but they do for areas that are a little bit tougher for water. But even you have the water. So they do it. So they come up with it’s one regulation for all over the country. So you go into a hotel or you buy a house and they have what’s called the restrictor. Right? Look at them. They’re all nodding. Same thing, by the way, same thing with your dishwasher. I freed that up, too. The dishwashers, they had a little problem. They didn’t give enough water, like, so people would run them 10 times, so they end up using more water. And the thing’s no damn good. We freed it up. Now you can buy a dishwasher and comes out and beautiful. Go buy a dishwasher. Go buy it. Those companies. I said, “What’s wrong with this thing? It doesn’t clean the dishes.” Right? The women come up to me, the women who they say don’t like me, they actually do like me a lot. Suburban women, please vote for me. I’m saving your house. I’m saving your community. I’m keeping your crime way down. I keep hearing, you know, it’s all fake stuff. Remember they said last time about women. Women will never vote. He will never vote for Donald Trump. They’ll never vote. Then the end of the evening, they’re all crying. Oh my God, what happened? Remember John King. What’s going on over here. Yeah, the red, red, red. He won Florida. He won Florida. It wasn’t that I won Florida, I won it like fast. And by the way, we’re way up in Florida right now, too. Because we’ve done a great job. Okeechobee, we’ve done a great job for Florida. We’ve done things for Florida that nobody took it ever be done. But anyway, but John King, so he’s up there. He won Florida. Oh, well that was quick. But the big, when we won Ohio, because did you ever hear, for a year and a half, when we were thinking about doing this, you cannot win unless you win the great state of Ohio, right? You heard that a hundred times. They were doing that for me, shtick. And then I get these polls. I had great people in Ohio. They said, “Sir, you’re going to win Ohio. You don’t even have to come back. You’re going to win Ohio.” By the way, they said that to me again, just recently. But they said, You can’t not win.” So we ended up winning Ohio by eight points. And it wasn’t that we won Ohio, but the polls closed at seven o’clock and it’s seven o’clock and one second, because you know, unless you win big Michael, right? You know, they keep you waiting. So the polls have closed in the great state of Ohio. Donald Trump has won the state of Ohio. They kept saying I was even. We had groups. I’ll tell you how accurate their polls were four years ago, I was down in nine states the day of the election. I won all nine states. Think of it. Right? Other than that, they were quite accurate. Actually, this time than much better if you want to know the truth. This time they’re actually much better. No, but we’re doing much better. And as I said, we have much more enthusiasm now. But anyway, getting back to my very boring story about faucets and dishwashers. So I said to the head, I called up great dishwasher company from Ohio that we saved, by the way, I said, “What’s the problem with your dishwasher? Well, they don’t give us any water. I mean, you know, it’d be nice to be able to get enough water. What’s the problem. We need more water. Not that much, but give…”. Like I said, how much do you need this? Would you like more? Well, I’d love more. Will you give us more? Yeah. I’ll give you more. You have so much water. You don’t know what to do with it. Right? So we gave them what they need. And now the dishwashers are incredible. They work beautifully. And you go one time and you come back and your dishes are nice and beautiful and clean and dry. You don’t have to go 10 times. The same thing with the restrictors in the faucet. So I hate to say the three things. It’s the shower, it’s the sink, and you know the third element in the bedroom. But I don’t say it because every time I say it, they only talk about that one. Because it’s sort of gross to talk about. Right? So I won’t talk about the fact that people have to flush their toilet 15 times. Okay? I will not talk about it. I’ll only talk about showers and okay? But there is three things. I won’t talk about it. This way they can’t report it. So what happens, so what happens, I go to my people, environmental people, why are we doing this? Because when you wash your hands, it takes you five times longer. You know the waters not coming, you’ve got soap, you can’t get it off. I said, “Open it up.” They said, “What do you mean?” “Take the restrictors off.” People know. And if you’re out here, you got to be careful. And you’ve got to do all the things you’ve been doing anyway. Take the restrictors off. And you may leave it in certain areas where you might need it. But most of the country, big portion, it doesn’t need it. Then on the shower, the worst. You ever get under a show where no water comes out? And me, I want that hair to be so beautiful. Right? Right? It’s true. It’s true. I want the hair to look good. I go into some of these hotels, you know, when you travel and I go into these hotels, new hotels. They do a nice. it’s not their fault. And I get in there, I say, “Oh, I can look at it now. I know that everything.” I say, “Oh, here we go.” Turn on the water, drip drip drip. Drip, drip. But now you go into a shower and the water pours out. You go into a sink and you can wash your hands very nicely, beautiful. And the third thing don’t worry about. Okay? We won’t talk. Just one time, that’s all. So I’m not just running against Biden, but you watch, there’ll be talking about the third thing. I’ve done this before. And they never even talk about sinks and showers. So I never talked. You’ll see how dishonest they are. But I’m running against a left wing media, big tech giants, and a corrupt political class and a corrupt Democratic party. You saw what they did. They spied on my campaign and got caught. They tried to take down the President of the United States. But they went after the wrong President. Let me tell you something. I really believe this. Somebody said it just today. Any other President would not have been able to withstand what we’ve done. They’d be in a corner with their thumb in their mouth saying, “Please take me home to mommy. Please.” These people are evil. Even Schiff today. You know shifty Schiff? Did you hear the new one? I was waiting for this. So they find this horrible, horrible laptop of Hunter. Where’s Hunter? Where’s Hunter? But Joe is far more corrupt than Hunter because Joe is getting a piece of everything. They have it in the email, 10% and 50%. But Joe is far more corrupt than Hunter. But what happens is they say where’s Hunter and they see what’s going on. Everybody’s looking for him. Everybody wants to find. And all we’re hearing is that you can’t talk about this kind of thing. You can’t talk. Can you imagine if that were Don Trump Jr.’s laptop? Or Eric Trump was such a fun, these are good kids, but they have just been brutalized by these maniacs. Or what about our great Ivanka Trump? Can you imagine? Tiffany. Even Barron, right? Barron. You know, Barron. No, they’re all good kids. But could you imagine, you know, Baron had the problem. Okay? He got healed in about 15 seconds, right? You got to understand that. You know, the young kids. What is it, 99.9 something. They said Barron tested positive. Even I wasn’t worried. You know, he’s strong. He’s definitely tall. He’s tall. And he’s a good kid. He’s a good kid. He’s a smart kid. But they said, “Sir, Barron tested positive.” At first she said, “Oh.” I said, “Well, is he okay?” “Yeah.” “Are you going to give them anything?” “No.” Like two seconds later, I said, “How’s Barron?” “Oh, he’s all set. He beat it.” I hate to say it. They have a much stronger immune system than we do. I hate to say that. You know? I said, “Congratulations, Barron.” I said, “That was quick.” I said, “How did it feel?” “I don’t know.” But the Democrats in this horrible group of people, they have nothing but disdain for you and for your values. They lecture you on the need for open borders while they live behind gated communities, like Nancy Pelosi. She doesn’t want a wall, but she lives in this very beautiful house with lots of good ice cream. They support crippling lockdowns while their jobs remain totally exempt. They keep your kids out of school while their kids and their families have private tutors, right? They want to take away your guns. They want to destroy your second amendment while they employ armed guards. And it’s time that we sent them a very strong message because they’re hypocrites in Washington D.C. and in Silicon Valley, and in Silicon Valley. Section 230. On election day. Not everybody understands that, but we have some great politicians here today that understand it. But on election day, you can send a message to the fake news media right there, to the big tech companies, and to the Washington swamp. We never knew it could be this deep. When I said drain the swamp, I didn’t know it was this bad. But send them a message that they will never forget. Show them that the American people are still in charge by delivering sleepy Joe Biden and the Democrats a thundering defeat on November 3rd. And if I don’t sound like a typical Washington politician, it’s because I’m not a politician. But I’ve dealt in politics for a long time. I know them very well. I know them all very well. I’ve dealt for a long time. I know them all. If I do not, thank you very much, if I do not always play by the rules of the Washington establishment, it’s because I was elected to fight for you harder than anyone ever before. Right? Thank you. Thank you very much. By the way, did you see Biden this morning? He was very agitated, [inaudible 00:47:10] agitated. He was very agitated, and he’s screaming at them. And he had nobody in the audience. He had a couple of cars. Did you see it? They’re honking their horn. I can’t believe it. And they don’t report that. You know, we got lucky. I think the camera man slipped and the camera went a little off kilter. Just like we want them to show our crowds. They don’t want them. I love watching those circles. He’s got those big, big… They’re so well done though. The best thing about his campaign is the guy or woman that does the circles. No, there’s a lot of talent there. They’re perfect. You know, I’m a perfectionist. frankly. I am. So it was a good builder. I look at those circles, very thick and very far apart, I think you got about six of them because that’s the number of people that show up. This way he can say, “We were sold out today.” I’m fin-I’m fighting against forces who want to destroy everything that you love and cherish. People think of Joe Biden as a nice man, but he’s not a nice man. No, he’s not a nice man. He was never a nice man. And he was never a smart man. He got lucky. He got lucky that Pocahontas didn’t quit earlier. And he’s not a good man. He’s a corrupt man. And he took an ad against me knowing it was false. You probably know the ad. It’s a horrible, vicious ad having to do with the military. It’s a totally false, horrible, horrible ad. And nobody has ever done more for the military than I have. Nobody. And we advised him and his group of dishonest cronies, legally, and every other way. We advised them, and we let them know. We’re putting complaints in all over the place. But he took a vicious, vicious, horrible ed of something I never said. It was a magazine that’s an Obama-type magazine with Obama and Biden and crooked Hillary. I won’t even mention it, a third-rate magazine. Loses a fortune. And they made up a story, and they said I said certain things. There’s no human being on earth, unless they’re seriously, seriously deranged, that would say such a thing. And I said it in front of other soldiers. And I have 26, I think, witnesses saying it’s ridiculous. Number one, you wouldn’t need any witnesses. Nobody would say anything like that. But we said it never happened. They have no witnesses. They have, I think, an anonymous source. But the source doesn’t exist. It was made up. It was made up just like the Russia, Russia, Russia bullshit was made up. So they made it up. They made up this lie, and now it’s in television commercials, like I said it. And frankly, if I were a military person, and if I saw that ad, I would never vote for Trump. And I told my people this is a very serious thing. They took a statement, made up a statement, just like they do. This is what they do. They’re vicious, horrible people. They made up a statement, and now they put ads in during a football game. I see an ad. I’m watching the game. I must tell you, I’m not into football so much anymore, if you want to know the truth. No, I’m not. It’s hard to watch. I love people that honor our anthem and honor our flag. And honor our country. Thank you very much. Thank you. And you look at the basketball. Did you see the basketball rioters filing in? Down 70, 70, 7-0, 70%. who the hell? I didn’t watch one shot. No interest. No, no. You know what? People want to watch sports. They have enough of us, right? They have enough of us. There’s plenty of us, but down 70%. in one way, it’s a shame. And another way… When we had this argument with the NFL two years ago, it really hurt them badly. They were down 25, 30%, right. People weren’t going to the games. And I felt we won the battle. I thought it was over. Then I saw her Roger, nice guy, Roger Goodell in his basement wearing a blue t-shirt tight, very tight, like he’s a player. It doesn’t work. I don’t want to have a tight one. I want it as loose as possible. But he’s wearing a tight one. He thinks he’s all buffed up and everything. Didn’t look good. No tie. Just a t-shirt, like an undershirt that’s painted blue. That’s a blue color. I don’t even think it had anything on it. And he said, “We’ve decided to do this and that.” And then I said, “There goes to the NFL right down the tubes.” This was during, I think, August. Nobody was even talking about it. What the hell is he doing? And here it goes again. Nobody cares about football because of it. And I don’t know how many chances they’re going to get, but they ought to get smart because they can’t win this war. We want people that love our country. We don’t want this crap. If a player is making $25 million a year doing something he’d be doing anyway on the weekend… Okay? Because he loves playing football. And if somebody is making 10 million for blocking a 25 million for throwing, and they say what a horrible country we’re living, we can’t do that. Can’t do it. And you know what? I want them to protest. I think if they want to protest, they can. There’s reason. There’s always reason to protest. They can. But not then, and not sitting on a knee instead of standing proudly with your hand on your heart. And you know, in the contract, they have a clause. You have to stand hand on heart. They actually have, I think, hand on heart. But they don’t want to exercise it because they’re weak. They’re weak people, and weak people is what got our country in trouble. And you talk about week and Joe Biden. Joe Biden and the socialists will kill your jobs, dismantle your police departments, dissolve your borders, confiscate your guns, and impose a $4 trillion tax hike on your companies and yourselves. Four trillion. Do you know what four trillion is? That’s the largest tax hike in history. And you know what they’re going to do with it? They’re going to spend it on the Green New Deal. Conceived by the brilliant AOC plus three. A poor student with absolutely no environmental experience, right? They want to attack religious liberty, drive God from the public square, and destroy your suburbs. I say that to the women because I keep hearing. They said, “The women from the suburbs.” No, I think the women from the suburbs are looking for a couple of things. One of them is safety. One of them is good, strong security. And one of them is they don’t want to have low-income housing built next to their house. And you know, who makes up 30% of your suburbs? Minorities. African Americans. Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, minorities. Okay? People think, “Is it racist?” It’s not racist. It’s the opposite. I’ve had people come to me and say, “Thank you so much.” But they keep talking about the women from the suburbs. I say, “I think we’re going to have a big resounding, ‘What the hell happened with women to the suburbs? They really like Trump a lot.'” Only vote for me if you’re a woman from the suburbs. And I shouldn’t say this because they’ll bring it up, but one time early on… I haven’t been doing this that long. I haven’t been doing it. I have guys that had been running, “Sir, I’ve been running for 40 years.” I said, “Well, I’ve only run for two years, but I became president. You didn’t.” But it’s interesting because I really think that women from the suburbs are going to like Trump, because it is about safety. It is about safety. And when you see what happens in our cities, where they run and ransack. They’re anarchists. And you know what? They actually say the suburbs are next. And just so you know, it’s so important. These are Democrat-run states and cities. Republicans are doing great. And we’re not going to let this happen, and we’ll stop it. We want a resounding victory. We’re going to stop it. But the suburbs are next. But I did say early on, I said, “Housewives from the suburbs.” They went after me when I said that. Let me ask you, the women from the suburbs, do you mind when we say “Housewives in the suburbs?” No? They’re all saying no. But I’ll do it politically correct anyway, if you don’t. I’ll say women. But I said, “Housewives from the suburbs.” They went crazy. “Donald Trump, he wasn’t politically correct.” I said, “Michael.” Biden supports cutting police funding, abolishing cash bail. You’ve got a murder. Oh, let’s let them out. Oh, let’s let them walk the street. You see what’s happening in New York? What they’re doing to New York, our governor, what he’s doing to New York is horrible. And he called law enforcement, Sleepy Joey called law enforcement, recently, “the enemy.” No, no. Law enforcement has done an incredible job. And you’re always going to have a bad apple. You’re always going to have somebody that chokes you. They have a quarter of a second. Do you ever see where they have? Do you ever see the test where somebody slashes open the door? You’ve got a quarter of a second. And they could be on the force for 30 years, but that’s a hard thing to do. And you’re going to have people they choke, like in sports. You see that they choke. Some people choke. Then you have Jack Nicholas and you have Tiger, and you have great people that tend to choke a lot less. But some people choke, and it’s not their fault. It’s just the way it is. You have a quarter of a second to make a decision, quarter of a second. Think of it. Joe Biden and the Democrat party, they’ve waged a war on police and cops and inciting riots. And that’s what you do. When you take away the majesty of that position, you are inciting violence. When you allow people to loot stores, and you have the police standing back…And they want to go in and do a job. Oh. And they can do it so easy. You don’t even need us to bring in the National Guard like we did in Minneapolis. Like we were ready to do in Seattle, and then they gave up the night before. Because they didn’t want to play games. I was so disappointed when they gave up. I was. The one I really want to do is Portland. That’s going to be so easy. We have to be invited, and the governor doesn’t want. I call her. I say, “Governor, let us go in. Give us 30 minutes, Governor.” But you know what? I don’t want to violate. I could, I guess, if I did. But we have to be invited in. And the city, it’s the craziest thing. These are anarchists. That would be the easier one. Would love to go in and do something big with Chicago. That’s actually a bigger problem. That’s actually a bigger problem. Harder. The easy one are the anarchist in the middle of the street that hate our country. Hate our cops. You saw them. They killed this young man, right? They shot him in the street. And a day went by. They knew the guy, and they didn’t arrest him. Another day went by, they didn’t. I called down. I said, “What’s going on?” They didn’t arrest him. They knew who he was. They knew where he was. They didn’t want. They would have never. So I sent in our great US Marshals. They were so happy. The law enforcement, they love our country. They were so happy. And this guy was a killer. He had other crimes, too, by the way. Bad ones. But he shot this young man right in the middle of the street. Shot him. You heard the bullet ring out. You heard the people’s scream. They knew who it was. They said, “That was so-and-so.” So after two and a half days, I said, “Go in. We got to get him.” Fifteen minutes, it was all over. It was all over. That was it. It was all over. Here in Nevada, rioters burned the city of Reno. And during the violent demonstrations in Las Vegas, a 29-year-old police officer was deliberately shot in the head while he was doing his job. Think of it. You know who that was, right? You know who that is, was. Joe Biden. Is he here or no? You know who I talking because of who his partners were. We talked to a lot of the people that were there. I think his partner’s here. But I want to tell you, we can’t let this happen. They’ve taken away the respect. You have to let them do their job. They’ll do it well. Remember in Minneapolis, where the mayor ordered the police to leave the premises? Seattle. Leave the premises. And then they took over the police department. You have that, you’re not going to have a country. But this is the radical left. This is the radical left. Joe Biden will appease the rioters, looters, and anarchists. And I’m having them arrested instead, if you don’t mind. And remember, it’s all the Democrat cities and states. All in Democrats. If you’re a moderate Democrat, or a liberal, who knows that your party has gone totally off the rails, we are welcoming you with open arms to the Republican Party. Biden’s agenda would also be a catastrophe for Nevada seniors. Seniors. Any seniors here? For years, Biden tried to cut social security and Medicare. You know that, right? Remember, they used to say, “Oh, I’m going to cut.” And, well, what happened? I never cut it. Remember, they said, “I’m going to be in wars.” That’s my personality, they think. It’s not really. It is if we have to. I’ll be better than anybody else. But you say, “Whatever happened to North Korea?” Remember, we were supposed to be in a war? With Obama or Hillary or whoever it was, you would have been in a war. Obama expected to be in a war. And it would have been a bad war. Now, Biden is pledging mass amnesty and free healthcare for illegal aliens, decimating Medicare and destroying your social security. While I am president, no one will touch your Medicare or your social security, including me. No one. Under my leadership, we are delivering a safe vaccine and very rapid recovery. And we’re all set to deliver it. We have the military ready to deliver it. It’s going to be incredible. We have a general, that’s what he does. He delivers soldiers and delivers everything. This is easy for them. It will be delivered very, very rapidly. Joe Biden would terminate our recovery, delay the vaccine, and annihilate Nevada’s economy with a draconian, unscientific lockdown. Because they’re finding out these lock downs aren’t working. Look at Europe. They’re having this massive surge. They’ve been locked down. Okay? Look at these lock downs. They’ve been locked down, and now they’re having a surge. Look at Michigan. Michigan had a surge. Well, who’s been tougher than her? She ran it like a prison. She was like a warden, right? And they have a surge. And then they say, “She’s doing a wonderful job.” I don’t think. I think she’s doing a terrible job. By the way, I know all of the governors. We basically deal with the governors. The governors run their states. We give them the equipment. We help them out. We got them all of the ventilators. We did an incredible job with it. Jared Kushner did a great job. We had so many. We had so many. No, he did an incredible job helping. He got these guys from Silicon Valley. Nobody understood. We didn’t. Ventilators, right? No, but for that, they’re good. I have to tell you. They came in. Everybody said, “These things are complicated.” They walked in like, “That’s got to be the simplest piece of equipment we’ve ever seen.” And we now have become the ventilator. We’re making thousands and thousands a month, and we’re actually giving. We don’t need any. But we didn’t have ventilators. We weren’t equipped for a thing like this. Our cupboards were empty. The governor’s were. And I got to know all the governors. Some did a great job, and some did a poor job. But when we had our weekly calls with the governors, they would say, even the biggest enemies, the biggest haters, “Sir, thank you very much.” Or to our great vice president, who headed up the task force, Mike Pence. Mike Pence. Oh, did he do well in his debate with her? That was unfair. If that were a fight, they would’ve stopped it. They should have stopped it. I said they should have stopped that debate in the middle. That’s a great expression, right? Boxing. You learn UFC. If that were a fight, they would have stopped it. But Mike was great, and he’s done great. And he did great with this whole thing. But the governors would say on conference calls, all 50, usually almost all of them were on because they all wanted everything. Their cupboards were empty. That was their fault, I guess. But let’s say it was their fault. But we had to help them. And we did. We built hospitals for some of them. We built everything. We did a great job. But they would say, “Thank you very much. Great job, great job, great job.” Every one of them. And if they weren’t happy, we’d would make them happy during the call because we had the generals, the admirals. We had great people, and we took care of them. And they’d say, “Great job. Thank you very much, Mr. President. Mr. Vice President, thank you very much. Great job.” We were sending a lot of gowns to Michigan. Goggles to Michigan. Lots of things to all the different states. But she’d say, “Great job. Thank you very much.” And we have it all down. It’s all down because I think all those calls… I hope they were taped. Hey, could you imagine if we didn’t have my call with the President of Ukraine, if we didn’t have that transcribed? Then it would have been this crazy maniac named Adam Schiff with his phony story that he told to the United States. But we had it transcribed. Isn’t that a wonderful thing? So I think we have it transcribed or taped. But all the governors, every one of them, “Thank you very much. Great job. Great job. Great job.” Then they go outside, and they see the press. They get nervous with the press. These guys. They make them nervous. “We’re not very happy with the job the president’s doing.” I said, “These no good people.” But you know what? Someday I’ll tell you the story. We had some great ones, and we had some people that didn’t know what the hell they’re doing. But I’ll let you know at the right time who they were. Under the Biden lockdown, the lights of Reno and Las Vegas we’re extinguished. Carson City will become a ghost town. If he comes in, Carson City will become a ghost town. And the Christmas season will be canceled. Look, remember I said we’re going to bring back Christmas? The name. Remember? We brought it back. Remember? I used to go around saying, “We will bring…” Because I saw these big department stores. They thought it was politically correct. So they’d say, “Have a great season.” I say, “No, I don’t want to have a great season. I want to say Merry Christmas. Say Merry Christmas.” Now, they’re all saying Merry Christmas. So I just want to introduce you a couple of warriors that are here. We’re joined tonight by congressmen. Mark Amodei. Come up, Mark. What a job you’re doing, Mark. He’s a warrior. Thank you, Mark. What a great job. What a great job. How are we doing? Okay? We’re doing all right here, right? Huh? Thank you very much. You’re doing good. Thank you, Mark, very much. We’re also a man who is a fighter. He is. But if he loses, I will never talk to him again. And he’s the Nevada Republican Party chairman. Respected by everybody. Loved by everybody. Michael McDonald. Michael. You look good, Michael. You look good, Michael. And congressional candidate. Somebody that’s going to win. And we’re working with him very strong. Jim Marchant. Jim. Thank you. I hear you’re doing good. I heard you’re leading in the polls, Jim. Get it done. We’ll help you. A friend of mine, and a man is doing really well. He’s a very smart guy, and respected by everybody. He’s watching those ballots come in. I think he’s watching every one of them. Your former attorney general, respected. They love him, and I love him. Adam Laxalt. So, Adam, are you and Nick finding any bad things? Anything bad happening? Can you please watch very closely, Adam? For the people, not for me. You’re not doing this for me. You’re doing it for the people. Okay. He’s got the most important assignment there is. Because a lot of bad things. They’re finding those things in creeks. They’re finding them in riverbeds. They’re finding them in ash cans and dumpsters. And large numbers in Ohio; 50,000 we’re missing. In Virginia, 500,000 applications were made that were false. And in one place, everything was good except for one problem. They forgot to put my name on it. Other than that, it was great. Other than that, it was great. Other than that. They were very reasonable, but my name wasn’t on it. And then, somehow that didn’t work out too well, Michael. A lot of them, too. And then they found some military ones. Great, great military ones. And they were found in a wastepaper basket. And they all had the name Trump on it. They were all signed for Trump. They were Trump. They voted for Trump. Unfortunately, I don’t think they’re going to get there because they were in the wastepaper basket. Anyway. And the Republican national committeeman from Nevada, Jim DeGraffenreid. Jim. Thank you, Jim. Great job. Great job, Jim. How’s it going? Good? We’re doing all right over here, Jim? Good. You’re a handsome man, Jim. As president, I’ve been delivering for our incredible Hispanic American community, like never before. Thank you, darling. Thank you. I like you, too. Thank you. It’s interesting. The polls are showing Trump. They’re say, “What the hell is going on with Trump and the Hispanic American community?” No, we’re at the highest level that they’ve ever had recorded for a Republican. It’s got to be higher, but it’s literally we’re beating the Democrats, who have been all talk and no action. All talk. I like Hispanics. I like Hispanics. I like Hispanics Americans. I’m taking care because I’m fighting for school choice, right? Safe neighborhoods and Hispanic-owned small businesses. You have no idea how great business people. Hispanic Americans are great business people. I’ve known that for a long time. Sometimes they say they’re too good. They are tough sometimes. But they’re great business people. And we’ve helped him. Joe Biden would crush everything Hispanic Americans have worked for, wiping out your small businesses with lock downs and regulations, and devastating your families with massive tax hikes. Your tax hikes. By the way, all my life, if you’re running for office, you cut taxes. Who the hell ever heard of a guy running? Here’s a guy, can’t put two sentences together. And he wants to quadruple your taxes. And they say, “He’s tied in Nevada.” How the hell can we be tied? How can I be tied with him in Pennsylvania, and he doesn’t want to frack? That’s a million jobs. And it’s going to destroy our energy business because we’re energy independent. We’re tied. What’s going on? And okay. So he goes out. Gets no people at any of the rallies. I go out, we get 35, 40,000, 25,000, 15,000. We go, boom! 15,000. We get the biggest crowds in the history of politics. Look, everything I say, they’ll correct. They’ll say… Who cares? I don’t even care what they say at this point. But we get these massive crowds. He gets nobody. And then they say, what tied. What the hell kind of a business are you in, Michael? It doesn’t make sense. How do you guys do this? He'll wage war on Catholic organizations, like the Little Sisters of the Poor, which we defend, ban charter schools, bankrupt Catholic schools… We help the Catholic church very much with our schools. We help fund their schools. … fund extreme late-term abortion and empower the socialists. That’s what they’re doing. That’s why we’re going to win a record share of the Hispanic vote this November. So please, right? I got her vote. Thank you, darling. Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure border in US history, and we are finishing the wall. The wall is going to be very close to being finished. Their new deal is this… Well, I got to tell you real fast, real fast. So their new deal is this, “He didn’t build much wall.” You ever see this? They said I renovate… You got a pipe that’s been laying in the sand for 30 years, a little pipe, and they call that a… And then we’re building this 30-foot wall. And I thought it would be all concrete, and I wish it was because it’s cheaper. But the Border Patrol wanted it to be slats. They have to be able to see through it, which makes sense. I said, “Oh, it’s more expensive.” So there’s two things. Now they say, “He didn’t build a concrete wall.” That’s right. I built steel, and inside the steel is concrete, and inside the concrete is very powerful rebar. And inside that, we have wires. I would’ve much rather built a concrete plank wall, but you know what? I built what they wanted. I don’t want to… Because they wouldn’t be able to see through it. So if they can’t see through it, no good. So here’s the new deal. They got pipe laying down. They got some wooden fence that’s like two feet. If they ever had anything there, they call it a renovation. So now they say they did this vicious story that we only built a small number of miles. We’re up to almost 400 miles, but we had to rip out… We ripped out almost nothing. But basically they had some areas where they’d keep people from walking. They had some little wooden stuff that was all rotted and no good and just… Anything that had anything on it, so they call it a renovation. This is not. We ripped everything out. We went down seven feet for tunneling, and we went up 30 feet. And they say this is a renovation. They’ll do anything, the fake news, to demean you, anything. It’s a disgrace. Anyway, we’re up to almost 400. Where is Jared? Is he here, by the way? I’d love to introduce. He did such a great job on Middle East peace. Do you see what we’re doing there? Middle East peace. Where is he? Ah, Jared. He doesn’t want any acclaim. He’s just a very smart guy. You don’t hire guys like this. Well, wherever the… He’s back working on Middle East peace probably. He said, “I’ve heard this guy before. I don’t have to hear him.” But it’s amazing what we’ve done in the Middle East. And we did the exact opposite the way they’ve been doing it for 50 years with blood all over the place. No blood in the sand, right? Joe Biden’s party continues to attack our incredible border agents, more than half of whom are Hispanic American, by the way. And they’re extraordinary. These extraordinary patriots deserve our admiration, our gratitude and respect. Right? They have it. Oh, my… Come here. Jared has the Middle East coming along, please. Coming along good. We signed the United Arab Emirates, Mohammed, one of the most respected warriors in the Middle East, and Bahrain. And we have other countries lined up. Even the New York Times said it’s incredible. I can’t believe it. I said, “No way. I’m sure that person was fired.” No, it was Tom Friedman. They’re not going to fire him. But they said it was incredible, but this guy has done a great job. And you know the nice thing? He wants no acclaim. He just wants to do what he wants to do. And also worked on Israel, the capital Jerusalem, right? With our embassy. Great job, Jared. And he has no weight problem, that I can tell you. He’s so skinny. How do you stay so skinny, Jared? Biden vowed to terminate our travel bans on jihadist regions and surge refugee admissions by 700%. He wants to let him come in. And I want to pay our respects to President Macron of France because you saw what happened over there yesterday. What a horrible thing. Radical Islamic terrorism. Thank you. And I tell you, I saw a lot of signs. We’re working on some things that you’re going to be… I saw a lot of signs, especially in California. You know that, [inaudible 01:17:06]. Armenians. Right? No, they’re good people. They’re great business people too for the Hispanic American, the Armenians, great business people. That’s great. No, we’re working. Where I just left, there were so many Armenians with a beautiful flag. And no, we’re working on some things. I’m keeping terrorists… You have great spirit in your country. I have to tell you, people from Armenia, they have great spirit for their country. Thank you very much. But I’m keeping terrorists, extremists and criminals out of our country. We invested $2.5 trillion in the United States military. We have the greatest equipment. We’re the envy of the world. We have the greatest fighters, the greatest rockets and missiles. We have the greatest of everything. We passed VA Choice and VA Accountability for our great vets. 91% approval. We killed the leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi. They were looking for him for years. We wiped out 100% of the ISIS caliphate. We took out the caliphate. And we killed the number one terrorist and mass murderer, anywhere in the world, American troops, many troops, many people, Soleimani is dead. I withdrew from the last administration’s disastrous Iran nuclear deal. My first call, if and when we win… If and when we win, have to be. We’re going against the party. If and when, but hopefully we do, my first call will be from Iran. Their economy is a disaster. They’re down GDP 27… I’d never even heard of that. They’re down 27%. It’s a disaster. They will call. And I don’t want that to happen. I want them to have a great country, but they can’t have nuclear weapons. It’s very simple. They can’t have nuclear weapons. And I think the first call we get will be from them. And they’ll sit down and want to make a deal. We’ll make a good deal. But what Kerry did… He’s… Oh, that’s right. We’re in Carson City, I forgot. Who said that? Who was the one that said that? Stand up. Let me see. That’s pretty cool. I recognized the true capital of Israel, as we said. And that was something that was really… By the way, when we did that and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem, I got it built for a tiny fraction of the cost. I won’t go into that story, but got it built. But when I did that, every president that ran for many, many, many of the presidents that ran many years, decades, decades, and they all said they’re going to do it. And then they got into office, they couldn’t pull the trigger, right? They couldn’t pull it. They couldn’t pull it like somebody couldn’t pull the trigger in that last little putt to win the match. They couldn’t pull the trigger. And then other guys can pull the trigger, and they sink it. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. 52 years, they’ve been trying to get it. I got it done in two hours. And I did more in 47 months than Sleepy Joe Biden did in 47 years. True. The Democrats are now pushing the most far left agenda ever put forward by a party or a presidential nominee. Biden doesn’t understand it. So I won’t bother with that. He still doesn’t know what the hell is happening. The Biden plan would destroy social security and destroy protections for pre-existing conditions. Biden’s running mate, they want to have socialized medicine, so you forget about your 180 million plans that we have in this country that people absolutely love. They want to have socialized medicine. You go to the hospital, you don’t feel good. You wait at a hospital for about three weeks. Biden’s running mate sponsored a bill to outlaw private health insurance. They want to wipe out the 180 million plans. Biden and Harris will also shut down American energy and obliterate your jobs with the socialist Green New Deal, as I said. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans. A vote for Republicans is a vote for the American dream. It’s vote for me. It’s a vote for the American dream. We’ll bring it back. Thank you. Thank you. And in conclusion, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. Carson City, get ready. But this whole state, get ready. And we will end our reliance on China once and for all. It’s already started. We will hire more police. We love our police. Thank you to our police and our law enforcement. And our great firemen and women, we love them. We really do. We have a lot of great support from the firemen and women. Increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. The people don’t even want the sanctuary cities. Only the politicians like them. We will uphold religious Liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms. Second Amendment. We will save… He put Beto in charge of taking your guns away. Beto. You remember when he was on the cover of that stupid Vanity Fair, which is, I think it’s dead. I think it died, but he was on the cover. And remember what he said? He was doing okay, not great, but they had him on the cover. They were trying to build him up. It didn’t work out too well for him. Remember what he said? He said, “I was born to run for president.” Once I said that, I said, “He’s gone. That’s the end of him.” Anybody says, “I was born to do this,” aye yai yai, he is a sick person. what a sick puppy that is. But he was put in charge by Biden to take your guns away. I don’t think he’s going to do too well in Carson City. Beto’s coming to take your gun. I don’t want to start anything. I want you to obey the law because I have to, or they’ll say, “He’s going to start a rebellion.” The fact is that Beto wants your guns taken away, Biden doesn’t even know what the hell it means. And I’m going to always protect your Second Amendment. By the way, your Second Amendment is under siege. Nothing has happened. Right? Nothing has happened. And there’s been a lot of pressure on me on your Second Amendment. Nothing. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens, and we will keep out all of those… We will just stay out of all of those horrible, endless wars with places you’ve never heard of. 19 years in Afghanistan. I think that’s enough. And we’re acting as basically law enforcement, we’re acting as police. Now they got to do it themselves. We’re bringing our people back home. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might, and we have a military might like nobody’s ever had before with our new everything. All made in the USA. And we will ensure peace through strength. We will end surprise medical billing, require price… You know what price transparency is, by the way? It’s the biggest… Adam knows. Michael knows. It’s the biggest thing there is. It’s bigger than healthcare in my opinion, and it’s all done. It’s signed. Price transparency. Watch. Further reduce the cost of prescription drugs. You know what I did? Favored nations. Nobody can believe I did it. You’re going to pay the lowest price in the world. And we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. America will land the first woman on the moon, and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag, NFL. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, “In God we trust.” For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great state of Nevada. So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, get your boss. Tell your boss, “Come here, boss. Got to vote. Got to vote, boss. Come on, boss.” Just grab him and just say, “Come on boss.” Get out and vote. This is the most important we’ve ever had. Get out and vote. They call it the red wave. They’re already saying they’re not happy about what’s happening. They know what’s happening. From Las Vegas to Reno, from Elko to Henderson, and from Carlin to right here in the wonderful, beautiful, hardworking Carson City, we stand on the shoulders of red-blooded American patriots who poured out their heart, sweat, and soul to secure our liberty. And we just love our liberty, don’t we? And liberty and freedom with bad leadership can be extinguished very quickly. You look at what happened in Venezuela and so many other places. We’re just a much, much bigger version. And if we let them do this, you’re not going to have it for very long. It’s a very sad thing. Most important election we’ve ever had. Nevada was founded by some of the toughest men and strongest women ever to walk the face of the earth. This state was built by pioneers and prospectors, miners and cowboys, innovators and trailblazers, who tamed the frontier, raised up the mighty Hoover Dam, transformed a sprawling, but beautiful desert into a shining oasis, and lit up the brilliant lights of the Las Vegas Strip, which I know so well. Our American ancestors made this into the greatest nation in the history of the world. And the best is yet to come. It’s happening. The best is yet to come. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We’re returning power to you, the American people. So with your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of Nevada, we have made America powerful again, we have made America wealthy again. Our stock market, new highs, your 401(k)s are doing very well. I don’t think you want to see them drop 100%. And they will if Sleepy Joe gets in. We’ve made it wealthy again. We have made America strong again, we have made America proud again, we have made America safe again, and we will make America great again. Get out and vote. Thank you. Thank you very much.

"90","10-19-20","Wow, thank you. Thank you. What a crowd. Wow. Wow. Thank you Tucson. Thank you Tucson. Wow. Wow, thank you very much Tucson, I’m thrilled to be in Arizona with the thousands of loyal, hardworking American patriots, 15 days from now, we’re going to win the state of Arizona And we are going to win four more years in that beautiful White House. Everybody needs to get out and vote, return your absentee ballot or vert. You know, you can go out there, I think today, when do you do it, today? Tomorrow? Whatever. You can go out and vote today, they say. Today, go out and vote. That beats a ballot. Do you agree, that beats a ballot? Remember the old fashioned days when you’d actually go out and vote, today they send you millions of ballots. Are you okay over there? Everyone fine. Good. Okay. He looks better than I do, that guy. He looks better than I do. Good. Thank you. You make sure you’re okay. With your vote, we’ll continue to cut your taxes and regulations, maintain energy independence, which we have now. Strengthen our military support, our police, protect our Second Amendment. I don’t know, I don’t see you people, I don’t think you’re going to want to give up those guns, I don’t think so. That’s that’s not for Arizona. Defend our borders, arrest violent criminals and confirm more judges to uphold the rule of law. Under my leadership prosperity will surge. What we’ve done in the last three and a half years has been incredible. Nobody’s ever done what we’ve done. There is no administration that’s accomplished what we’ve accomplished in the first three and a half years. Not even close. Optimism will boom, the pandemic, it’s rounding the turn, vaccines are coming and I look fine, don’t I? And we’ll get back to a normal life. That’s what we want, just a normal, just seven months ago, we want to get back. It will be better than that, very soon. We built a foundation that’s so strong and you see what’s happening? Stock market through the roof, your 401k’s through the roof, you stocks through the roof, your housing through the roof, everything is good. Your optimism. And what about 56% of the people? Just a Gallup poll, just came out, 56% of the people say they’re better off today than they were four years ago and we have a pandemic. And next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country, that’s what’s going to happen. We’re cutting your taxes, they’re raising your taxes. That’s an easy one to figure out, isn’t it? This election is a choice between a Trump super recovery or a Biden depression, if he even gets to run. It’s a choice between getting a safe vaccine and getting back in and working. And by the way, you have a governor here today, he’s done a great job and he’s kept you open. You’re open. Unlike some of them like Michigan, we won the case in Michigan. The only one that was allowed to have a good time was the governor’s husband. He was allowed to do whatever the hell he wanted, but nobody else, they were like in a prison. But we’re going to have a safe vaccine and Biden, you know what he’s going to do? Lock them down. Let’s lock everybody down. But we built the greatest economy ever. We had to close it down, we saved millions of lives by doing what we did. Then we built it back up and now we’re doing record type numbers. And it’s a choice between the American dream or a socialist nightmare, that’s what it is. Biden will delay therapies, postponed the vaccine, prolong the pandemic, close your schools and shut down our country. And we’re opening and we’re opening rapidly. And we’ve got a V-shape. It may be a super V. It looks like it’s a super V, which nobody ever even heard of before. He will massively raise your taxes, you will be buried in regulations. We cut regulations, it would take 18 to 21 years to get a highway approved. We have it down to one year. And you know what? From two to one will very shortly to be exact, right now it’s less than two would have it down to one year and it may get rejected for environmental reasons of safety and that’s okay. Probably not, but that’s okay, but you know what? You’re going to have it approved or not approved and it’s a one-year process, not a 21-year process. And this has gone on all over the country. And in my opinion, what we’ve done on regulations, is even more important than the biggest tax cut in the history of our country. I think it’s more important. And they’re going to bring all those regulations back. They want to dismantle your police department, dissolve your borders. Dissolve your borders. If you don’t have borders, you don’t have a country. Confiscate your guns, ban American energy, wipe out private healthcare, 180 million people terminate religious liberty. This is for the women, the women who live in the suburbs, they want to destroy your suburbs. And I ended the rule that was going to destroy. I ended the regulation that was going to … I kept hearing that women from the suburbs, won’t like Trump. I said, “Why? Because I’m stopping crime?” You’re going to have suburbs be safe. Suburbs, you’re having safe suburbs. And you’re not going to have low-income housing projects built next to your house. We ended the regulation that would have destroyed your suburbs. It’s amazing how the women like me, all of a sudden. As you know, the Democrats, they want to cut our military to the bone. And we built the greatest military right now in the history of our country, frankly, in the history of the world. Biden will surrender your jobs to China. He wants to render your future to the virus and he will surrender your country to the radical socialist left, and you see that happening. The only thing Biden wants to do, is get as much as he can for himself. Have you been watching this whole thing play out? I didn’t know anything about it. Oh, here’s a picture of Biden playing golf with these men. “I didn’t know my son was taken money from [Barisma 00:00:11:24]. I didn’t know my son got three and a half billion dollars from the mayor of Moscow’s wife, I wonder why.” And then, you see all the things, right? That we have to give the man 10%. We have to give the man 10%, right? Boy. I’ll tell you what, nobody’s ever seen. And the media, right? And big tech, they won’t allow it. Charlie Kirk, you know Charlie Kirk, great guy? They shut down his site because he mentioned it. Look, he’s a corrupt politician this guy, he’s a corrupt politician. To get the power, Biden has made a corrupt bargain in exchange for his party’s domination. He has handed control of his party over to the socialists, the communists, the Marxists and the left wing extremists. And that’s before we get to his own personal corruption, which is more than anybody in history. I say this, it’s the second biggest scandal politically in the history of our country. Number one, was spying on my campaign and getting caught. Biden even chose as his running mate, the most liberal senator in America, Kamala, Kamala. Senator Kamala Harris, is a sponsor of the socialist green new deal and legislation to strip away the private health plans of 180 million Americans. And, her and Bernie Sanders want to do something in Arizona, they have some deal in Arizona where your taxes are going to go way up. You know that right? Your governor, who’s right over here, you’re great governor was saying, he’s not happy with it. But Bernie Sanders, the second most liberal person, she’s first, right? She’s considered first. They want to raise your taxes eight and a half percent. So I’m glad … Right, governor? He’s saying more. It’s probably more. What is the name of that governor, rural what? Right? You know about it. Okay, you can’t have them in, because they control Biden a 100%. Biden is shot. You know, he’s shot, right? He’s gonzo. Harris also urged their supporters to donate to a fund that bailed out the rioters, the ones that knocked out your towns, your cities. Not in Republican areas, by the way, all in Democrat areas. You look at Portland, we would have taken 15-minutes, we could have solved that. We told the governor, Democrat, “Let us in, we’ll solve that problem.” We went into Minneapolis, it took us a half an hour, that was over with. Unfortunately, they could’ve called a little earlier. And in Seattle, they gave up when they heard we were going in the next morning. But we resolved, look, all Democrat areas, New York going to hell. I feel so sad with New York, crime is up 200, 250%, Cuomo. A terrible thing has happened in New York. Look at Chicago, Democrat again. Crime is through the roof. That a weekend, 87 people were shot and 16 died. Now, do you believe, this isn’t, “Hey, we’re in Afghanistan, you don’t lose many people.” Were coming out by the way, we’re all coming back home. But you go to war zones, you don’t have that. And we could solve it so easily. And we can solve it so easily. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You know, there’s never been that chant before? Seriously. We all like Ronald Reagan, I guess he’d be, but he never had that chant. We love you. Thank you though. We love you. You’re going to make me cry. Don’t do that. I don’t want to cry. I don’t want to cry. You make me cry, you’ll destroy my image, and then you won’t love me anymore. That would be terrible. I appreciate it. No, I do. And I feel the same way. That’s why I’m doing this. I had a good life before I did this stuff. Believe me. My life was very simple and very nice. The Democrat party’s war on cops is inciting riots and putting police officers and American families in very grave danger. Unlike Joe Biden, I will always support the heroes of law enforcement. And I was endorsed by almost every law enforcement group in the United States, including New York’s finest, and Chicago, and Florida and Texas and Oklahoma, and every place. And I was just named, I have to say this happened today, the man of the year in that big magazine, the blue magazine, good name for it. Man of the year. So I just tell you that, for whatever reason I tell you that. I’m the only one standing between you and a left-wing crusade. You know, you have people, they want to change our whole country. And the thing that’s going to bring us back together is success, because I’ll tell you, we were ready. I was getting calls, seven months ago, we had the best employment numbers we ever had, we had the greatest success we’ve ever had. We were beating China at everything. You kept hearing about China, we were beating everybody. And they were calling me, people that I wouldn’t be speaking to generally, let’s get together. It was happening. And then we got hit by the China plague. And then we had to start all over again. Success brings us together. I saw it, and we saw it for two months. It was really going on. A new study of the Biden/Harris agenda found that their plans will crater the typical American family by more than $6,500. They’re horrible, horrible plans, to finance what? The blue? The new green deal. The green new deal is the craziest thing, right? No more airplanes, no more double cars, no more cows. If you have a ranch, you won’t have cows anymore. No more you. You’ll be next, in just three years, I increased family income by $6,000. And we’re not even talking about the energy. Did you ever think you’d be seeing $2 gasoline again? And you got that. And it’s plentiful. And we saved all our energy jobs. All of our energy jobs, we saved. Biden will eviscerate the middle-class, my policies will lift the middle class to record highs, and that’s where we’re going very quickly. For the last 47 years, Sleepy Joe Biden chipped away your jobs. Shut down your factories, threw open your borders, and ravaged our cities while sacrificing American blood and treasure in these endless ridiculous foreign wars. In countries you never even heard of. Joe Biden is a servant of the left wing globalists and lobbyists, the wealthy donors, the Washington vultures, who got rich bleeding America dry. You know, they raise a lot of money, the Democrats, you know why? Because they make deals. They make deals. I would be the greatest fundraiser in history if I wanted to call Wall Street, I know them all. I want $10 million for my campaign. Yes, sir. All I have to say is I want 10 million. I went 15. I went 25. I would set every record. But you know what happens when you do that? You’re selling yourself out. When you have to do something, you can’t do it anymore, because you feel guilty. See them setting all sorts of records. I know what the records are. The records are every time they set a record, they gave away everything. In 2016, you voted to fire this corrupt and decrepit political establishment. And you elected an outsider as president who is finally putting America first. About time. It’s about time. Joe Biden is always and always has been a corrupt politician. Joe Biden is a corrupt politician. And you know what? You knew that, and a lot of people knew it for a long time, but now you have the laptop, it’s over. It’s over. And as far as I’m concerned, the Biden family is a criminal enterprise. And that’s what it is, it’s a criminal enterprise. Smoking gun emails, Joe, and we just found them. You saw that. Did you see shifty shift? We think that the laptop was made by Russia. Oh, I see. He just said it was made by Russia. Here we go again. Russia did it. Russia, Russia, Russia. You know, the head of DNI, John Ratcliffe who’s fantastic came out and said, “That was false information.” No, these are bad people. These are sick people. Do you notice, they never say it was made by China? Because they’re all on the take. Smoking gun emails show, just came out that the Biden family used the vice presidency as a for-profit cash machine. And that Joe Biden has been lying to the American public to cover it up. Remember he said, “No, I never met anybody from Barisma is it? Is it Barisma?” Actually I that I understand. Because he’s got no memory left. It’s gone. Is it Barisma? No, I don’t… and then they show a picture of him playing golf with the head of Barisma. Ah, boy, oh boy. If Biden wins, China wins. And China will own the USA. Remember what I said? The media and big tech is trying to hide the entire scandal. Do you believe what they’re doing? They’re taking people like a Charlie Kirk and others off if they even mention that Biden is corrupt. And they know he’s corrupt, but he’s their corrupt. He’s so perfect for them. He’s their corrupt. Because they know that publicizing these revelations would mean an end of Biden’s presidential run. I think it’s an end right now. Look, I think it’s an end right now. How the hell could you do, when you see the kind of things that they do, where the big guy has to get at least 10%, the big guy. I wonder know who the big guy is? Gee, I wonder. If you put him as president, you should be ashamed of yourselves, you want to know the truth. I’m not just running against Biden, I’m running against the left-wing media, the big tech giants, and the Washington swamp. And I’ve been running against it from the beginning. And here I am all by myself. Aye yi yi. Anybody else, they would have been in a corner right now thumb in mouth saying, “Mommy, take me home, mommy. I want to go home.” No, it’s great. You know why it’s great though? Because nobody’s ever done what we’ve done. Nobody. Drain the swamp. They flood your communities with criminal aliens, drugs and crime, while they live behind beautiful gated communities. They try to take away your guns while they enjoy private securities, and fully armed, by the way. How fully armed. How about Bloomberg? “We are fighting guns.” And he’s got five guys around him with guns. They support crippling lockdowns while their jobs and their industry remain totally exempt. It’s time to send a message to these wealthy liberal hypocrites in Washington and in Silicon Valley, show them the American people are in charge by delivering their chosen candidate sleepy Joe Biden, who shouldn’t even be their candidate. He should have lost because Elizabeth Pocahontas Warren, if she would’ve dropped out at the day before Super Tuesday, Joe would have lost every single state to crazy Bernie. It’s a very simple business. But we have to show them, the Democrats, a thundering defeat on November 3rd. And if I don’t sound like a typical Washington politician, it’s because I’m not a politician, that’s for sure. If don’t always play by the rules of the Washington establishment, it’s because I was elected to fight for you harder than anyone has ever fought for you, which is true. And I’m fighting so hard, I had a great life. I’m fighting so hard, because I love my country, and because I’m determined to ensure that the forgotten men and women of this country are never forgotten again, and they won’t be, they won’t be. And we taught that lesson to him four years ago, but we’re going to teach him again, because this is the most important. I used to go, a few months ago say, “Well, I don’t know. This is important. That’s important, which is more important?” This is the most important election in the history of our country. The Biden agenda would be a catastrophe for Arizona seniors. Do we have any seniors in the house? Biden is pledging mass amnesty and free federal healthcare for illegal aliens. You saw that, where he was up on the stage with his radical left Democrats. Who’s willing to give free healthcare to illegal immigrants? They said, to illegal immigrants. And everybody raised their hand, and Biden couldn’t get his up. Because he knew, he’s been doing this crap for 47 years. He couldn’t, he knew it was wrong, but then he looked, and his brain is shot. So he looked over there, and the hands were all up. And then he looked over there, and the hands were all up. There were a lot of them. He knew it was wrong because it would be so horrible for our country, because everyone’s going to flood our country. You get free healthcare. You get free healthcare, you get free education. I jokingly said, and everybody gets a Rolls-Royce. And CNN said, “That’s a lie.” So what happened is he couldn’t get it up, and then he looked and he looked and he got it up. And I said, “Thank you. We just won the election.” He would decimate Medicare if he did that, and it’s not going to be up to him, that’s his party. That’s what they want. They want socialized medicine. And he’ll destroy your social security. While I’m president, no one will touch your Medicare or your social security. You know, the amazing thing, Biden’s always complaining, “Oh, we didn’t stop China fast enough.” Except he didn’t want to stop them at all. You know, little things like this. But he’s always complaining. And yet he was here for 47 years, I say, “Joe, Joe, it’s not like you’re an outsider.” And it wasn’t that long ago, either. 47 years, and all he does is complain. Biden had 47 years to fight for seniors and reduce prescription drug costs, and look what I’ve done. And I’ve just exercised, they’re going to come down 70, 80, 90%. Because I just did something that nobody thought anybody would do. A favored nations flaws, we pay the lowest in the world. You’ll see numbers that are shocking, they’re not happy with me, the Big Pharma, Big Pharma is spending a lot of money. When you see those ads, please remember, every one of those ads means your drug prices are coming down. They can’t believe it. I tried to make a deal with them. I did. I tried, but we couldn’t. In the end, we couldn’t. They got too greedy, too much money, too much money. But you know, last year we brought drug prices down 1%. I’m not bragging about it, it’s the first time in 52 years that drug prices came down. But now we’re going for the big one. Now we’re going for the big one. And you know, rebates, the richest people, the middleman, you know the middlemen about drugs? We have middlemen. Nobody knows who the hell they are. Never hear middle women. I hear middlemen. So we’ll make it politically correct. Middlemen middle. No, they’re called middlemen. Nobody knows who they are. These guys are so rich. Who are they? I’ll bet you Hunter gets a piece of the action. Hunter Biden is a middleman on top of everything else. He gets it from China. He gets it from Ukraine. He got three and a half million from Russia, from Moscow. He got three and a half. And on top of everything else, he’s a middleman. I bet he is. He probably gets a piece of the action. But instead he sold seniors out to the drug lobby and to Big Pharma. That’s Biden senior. I’m taking on the powerful, special interests, like never before. Nobody’s ever done this before. Nobody’s ever done it before. I mean, for years you heard about drug prices, nobody ever did anything. And now you hear about drug prices, and they’re dropping. They’re going to be dropping like a rock. Also, I’m letting your governor, your great governor, buy, until the thing kicks in and probably litigation. But I’ve exercised this whole thing with favored nations. So if Germany pays 25 cents for a pill, and we’re paying two and a half dollars, and you have that kind of disparity, it’s ridiculous, that we have the right to match. In other words, we get the lowest price. But until it kicks in, Canada pays half of what we pay. So I’m letting your governor and other governors go to Canada, buy your drugs through Canada, save 50%. We get rid of the middleman. The other thing we did, very big, much less than what we’re talking about, but very big. We capped insulin costs for medicine and Medicare. For Medicare plans at less than $35 a month. People were dying because they couldn’t afford insulin. 33 million seniors, 33, think of this, $35, but 33 million seniors on Medicare will soon be receiving $200 to help with their drug costs on top of everything else. Nobody’s done, by the way, in all fairness, nobody has done anything like this, but your big thing, your big thing is going to be when you see what happens with the favored nations, because you’ve been hearing about it for years, where other countries are paying a tiny fraction of what we, we bear all of the costs because our politicians sold us out. They sold us out, but I’m not a politician, so it’s one of the … I couldn’t stand watching it. To battle the China Virus, we launched the largest mobilization since World War II. Our early and aggressive action saved more than 2 million lives. I acted early to ban travel from China. How about this? You should’ve done it sooner. But in the meantime, when I did it, he called me xenophobic, right? Then months later he agreed that I was right. Now he’s saying I should’ve done it sooner. This guy. I also banned it from Europe, because I saw with Italy and with Spain and with France. By the way, they have a big spike right now. They have a very big spike right now and we’re doing good. We are rounding the turn. We have the vaccines coming and all, but even without, we’re rounding the turn. People are pandemiced out. You know that? They’re pandemiced out. That’s why it’s so great what your governor’s done. He’s opened up your state. You’re doing great. We pioneered [inaudible 00:31:26] and by the way, you get it. Like I say, here I am. I’m here. I’m here and now I’m immune. I can jump into this audience and kiss every man and woman. I’m immune. Right? They say, it used to be you’re immune for life. Then when I got it, I said, “I’m immune.” They said, “It’s only good for four months.” See, if anybody else … You understand that, right? I’ll jump into that audience right there. We pioneered life-saving therapies and reduced the fatality rate, 85%. Think of it. I had it too. I didn’t feel good. I felt not so great, and I’m not used to that. We can’t let that happen to a president because we have to be at the top of our game. That’s why you can’t let Biden be president, because he’s not at the top of his game, mentally. We can’t have that. One thing I can tell you, Putin, president Xi of China, Kim Jong-un, all of them. Macron, they’re very much at the top of their game. You can’t let this happen to our country. You can’t. But I was, I was landing, and if you’re a president, one thing you’re guaranteed, lots of doctors. They would grab me at A, grabbed me by every part. They had hands all over me. I said, “Get the hell out of here. I just don’t feel good”. We ended up, I used the drug Regeneron, which nobody ever thought about six months ago. I woke up the next morning and I was like, I felt like Superman. “Get me out of here.” I said, “Get me out of here.” Eli Lilly makes a similar product, and we’re going to distribute that. We’re trying to get emergency use so we can do it faster because it’s early, but it’s fantastic, antibodies. We’re going to distribute it all over. We’re going to make sure that people that have a problem, they can get the same drug as I got, and I’m telling you it’ll be the same result. It’ll be the same result. And it’s free. We’re going to do it free. Companies are working with us, because it’s done their fault. It’s China’s fault. It’s not their fault. But I woke up and I felt good. I said, “Get me out of here.” Boom, Superman. Through Operation Warp Speed, we will have 100 million vaccine doses before the end of the year, and our military is going to distribute them. They are, there’s nobody liked our military. The vaccine will end the pandemic. But even without the vaccine, the pandemic is ending. It’s going to end. It ends with it, but you know, this can go quickly. This can make it go a lot faster. Biden’s lockdown will crush America. My plan will crush the virus and bring back your American dream. we’re joined today by some very special people. A friend of mine, somebody that’s been with me from the beginning, I’ve been with him from the beginning. He’s very difficult because when he needs something for the state, like money, he’ll call me all the time. I say, “Doug, do me a favor. Give me a break.” But I guess that’s what you’re supposed to do, right? That’s what you want. He’s supposed to call. Finally, I’ll say, “All right, Doug, you got it. Get out of here. Promise not to call.” Then he’ll call me two weeks later. “I need more,” but he’s a great governor. One of the greatest governor. He’s done a fantastic job. You’re down to very low numbers by the way. Doug Ducey. Doug, please. We want you to vote for Martha McSally. Save your Second Amendment. Save your Second Amendment. Doug, you want to come up? Come up, Doug. Come here for a second. Come on, Doug. I’ll tell you, this guy has been a great guy. I don’t know if you like him or not. I don’t care. He’s been a great guy. Come on Doug. Thank you. Thank you, Doug. He’s a great governor. He’s a great, great governor. What a job he’s done and you know what? We’re not going to take her time or anything, but Martha McSally is here. She’s saving your Second Amendment. She’s been a great, great Senator. Martha, come here, honey. She’s been a great, great Senator and just go out and vote for Martha McSally. Save your Second Amendment. Save your Second Amendment. Thank you. I’ll see you done here. Thank you, darling. She’s done a great job and she’s a worker. She’s a great fighter pilot. They told me all about her. Some of the pilots, they said she was a great fighter pilot. Thank you, Martha. Thank you. Thank you, Doug. We also have a congressional candidate that they say is a star in the making. I’ve heard it from a lot of people. Vote for Brandon Martin. Where’s Brandon? Brandon, good luck, man. I hear it’s going going good? Good. Thank you, Brandon. Brandon Martin. Thank you, Brandon. You’re going to do great. I heard you’re doing really well. Under my administration, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world, and now we’re doing it again. You know, it’s make America great again, right? I say, make America great again, again, again, again. We did it and now we had to do it again. It’s all right. It’s happening, and it’s happening much faster. It looks like a super V. In my first three years, we increased family income more than five times the gains in all eight years under the last administration. Think of that. Five times more in the first three years, five times more than eight years of the Obama/Biden administration. This is not even believable. African-American unemployment, Hispanic-American unemployment, Asian-American unemployment, all reached record lows, the lowest in the history of our country. We lifted 6.6 million Americans out of poverty, including more than 1.5 million Hispanic-Americans. That’s a record. I’m doing very well in the polls with Hispanic-Americans, but I always liked you, and you always liked me. The fake news just didn’t know that. Our policies are lifting up all Americans of every income. Since the China Virus, we created 11.4 million American jobs. It’s a record too. Nobody’s ever seen anything like it. The unemployment rate, and normally I wouldn’t be happy about this, right? But the unemployment rate a week ago hit 7.8%. Think of that. Now, we were hearing 42. It’s going to go to 42. It’s going to go to 44. It’s going to go to 38. 7.8% and heading this way. Think of that. Would you believe that? Normally, I wouldn’t say it, because we were at 3.4, 3.5 and had even better than that, but that’s okay. We’ll be there. After the virus left China, we experienced the smallest contraction of any major Western country and the fastest recovery anywhere in the world, from an economy standpoint. We’ve already cut the unemployment rate in less than half. That’s a fantastic thing. Under Biden and Obama, it took over three and a half years for Arizona to regain 60% of the jobs lost in the crisis. We’ve done it in four months. Think of that. It wasn’t our fault. It wasn’t our fault. Manufacturing production is up 61%. Retail sales are up, excuse me, 121%. That means more than before the pandemic. Automobile production. Nobody’s going to believe this one, is up 350% since April [inaudible 00:41:23] 350%. I have a way that we can stop it. Elect Sleepy Joe. No, no. Who has a 401k? Okay. If I told you that your 401k’s and you’re all at record highs are very close, right? If I told you that your 401k’s will be cut in half and much worse than that, that’s what’s going to happen. You’re going to end up in a depression with this guy. He’s going to raise your taxes by four or five times. They’re going to put on regulations. Every company is going to say, “Let’s get out of here.” Because I’ll tell you, the regulation cuts, which are more than anybody, than any administration’s ever done, the regulation cuts in their own way were more important than the biggest tax cut in the history of our country. Thank you, man. As president, I’ve been delivering for our incredible Hispanic-American community, like nobody has done before. I’m fighting for school choice, safe neighborhoods and Hispanic- owned, small businesses. Joe Biden would wipe out your small businesses with lockdowns and regulations. You know, he said the other day, “Oh, I’d lock it down.” Oh great. Thanks a lot, Joe. We appreciate it. And devastate your families with massive tax hikes. He will wage war on Catholic organizations, band charter schools, fund extreme late-term abortion. He’ll let socialists run wild and we will never have a socialist country. We will never have it. We can’t. We won’t have a [inaudible 00:13:07]. That’s why we’re going to win a record share of the Hispanic vote this November. Get out and vote. Get out and vote. For decades, our politician spent trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign wars, defending foreign borders. But now we are finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities. We are protecting our borders. You know, the wall is almost finished, right? Our Southern border. By the way, the biggest beneficiary, maybe happens to be, Arizona. That wall, how good is the wall? The governor was telling me before they stopped coming in. Now they come in, they come in legally. Now the wall is great. It goes down deep and it goes up high. No more tunneling. We’re bringing our jobs, our factories, our troops back home in the USA where they belong. Right? Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure border in US history. Our Southern border is now, and I want to thank Mexico. Mexico has, right now, 27,000 troops guarding our border. How about that? We built almost 400 miles of the wall. We’re averaging about 10 miles a day, and it’s the best. It’s exactly what border patrol wanted. I said, “I’d just liked to put up concrete plank.” They said, “No, sir. We got to have it this way, Sir.” We gave them the ultimate. We gave them everything they wanted and they’re really happy, and it’s had a huge impact. We’ve got the best border that we’ve ever had. You know what? You have a big chunk of it right here, and it’s really worked. You have 200 miles, they tell me. 200 miles. 200 miles. I didn’t even know you had that. That’s a lot of mileage. You’re not paying a damn cent for it either. All compliments of the federal government. Remember when Nancy Pelosi, they all said, “We don’t need a wall. Walls are obsolete.” Two things don’t get obsolete, walls and wheels, right? Everything else is obsolete. You know, they developed a new chip yesterday in about 15 minutes. It’s going to be obsolete. They developed a new computer, 15 minutes obsolete. The two things that will never be obsolete, a wheel and a wall. Remember the Democrats, they said, “No, we want drones. We want drones.” So you can have drones watching everybody pour into the country. No, thank you. Nope. 200 miles of wall in Arizona and you got it all. It’s all done. Joe Biden’s party continues to attack our incredible border agents and they are more than half of whom happened to be Hispanic Americans. I know a lot of them. Right? There they are. Oh. These sort of guys here. Am I right? Right? The Republican party will always stand with the heroes of ICE and Border Patrol. These are incredible people. They’re doing an incredible job. My opponent’s immigration plan is the most extreme proposal ever put forward. Biden’s plan would eliminate U.S. borders by implementing nationwide catch, they want nationwide catch and release. You know what catch and release is? You catch them, take their name. They could be murderers, rapists, and then you release them into our country. Guess what? We don’t do that anymore. Okay? That wasn’t easy. And they want to make every community into a sanctuary city, and they want to suspend all removals of illegal alien. So what they’re doing, and this is done by crazy Bernie, right? You know, Bernie Sanders made a deal, we call it the manifesto, with Joe Biden and it’s further left than Bernie ever was. Joe did a great job of negotiation. Supposed to bring him to the right. He brought him to the left. It would mean the total nullification of U.S. borders, overwhelming every city and town in America. MS-13 and criminal cartels would rampage throughout our country freely. If Biden wins, your borders are gone which means your healthcare is gone. The middle-class is gone. And your safety is gone. Other than that, he’s doing quite a good job. From the moment I took office, I worked night and day to stop illegal immigration. It wasn’t easy. And now we’ve got it. And stopping it for Arizona, that was a big deal. I ended catch and release. I closed the lobbyist loopholes. I took down the smugglers and coyotes. These are not nice people, by the way. And I kept my promise to the American people. We are finding the drug dealers all over and we are arresting the drug dealers like they have never been arrested before. We’re finding the predators. We’re finding the gang members. We’re finding MS-13 killers, and we are either throwing them in jail or sending them the hell back home where they came from. We invested $2.5 trillion in our military. We have the greatest equipment now anywhere in the world. And you know, when I first got here, a very highly overrated general told me, “Sir, we have no ammunition.” I said, “No President should ever hear that.” We have no ammunition. Truly. This was a general who I didn’t have a lot of respect for, but he said we had no ammunition. So I said, “Well, we’re going to have to do something.” We got $2.5 trillion. We now are the envy of the world. We have weapons the likes of which nobody in the world has, Russia, China, nobody. And for our vets, we passed VA Choice and VA Accountability. We killed the leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi, and we took out the world’s number one terrorist and mass murderer of American troops, and many, many people, Soleimani is dead. I withdrew from the last administration’s disastrous Iran nuclear deal, $150 billion, $1.8 billion in cash. Not the best deal. It would have been ending now almost anyway. I recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. They’ve been working on that for 52 years. I got it done in two hours. And instead of the endless wars, we’re forging peace in the Middle East, no blood in the sand. I did more in 47 months than Joe Biden did in 47 years. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, a limitless future, and for the American dream. It’s for the American dream. Remember, the Republican party is the party of Abraham Lincoln, right? The party of America. You know, Abraham Lincoln, I tell that to people, they never knew. They said, “Gee, I never knew that.” But Abraham, honest Abe was a special person. But in conclusion, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we will end our reliance on China once and for all. It’s already happening. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens and we will keep America out of these ridiculous foreign wars, foreign wars, countries you’ve never even heard of. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency. It’s already done. It’s all signed. Starts on January 1st. It’ll be more important watch than healthcare. It’ll be even more important. I’m telling you, it’s the numbers you’re talking about, price transparency. Remember. Further reduce the cost of prescription drugs, and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. Always. America will land the first woman in the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. It’s happening soon. And NASA is now the space center of the world. Again, it was a mess. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, In God We Trust. For years, you had a President who apologized for America. Now you have a President who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of Arizona. This is the most important election in the history of our country. It’s the most important. I never thought I’d be saying that. It’s the most important. Thank you. Thank you very much. Very much appreciate it. This is the most important election in the history of our country. And I never did. I’d never thought I’d be saying that, but I’m seeing where these people want to take us. They want to take us into a land that’s never worked. Look at Venezuela. It’s the same ideology, same philosophy. It’s just a much bigger version, but it can happen. We can’t let it happen. The United States will never be a socialist nation. Can’t happen. So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your co-workers, get your boss, and get out and vote. From Phoenix to Flagstaff, from Mesa to Yuma, from Tombstone, what a great name, to right here in Tucson, we stand on the shoulders of red-blooded American Patriots who poured out their heart, sweat, and soul for our liberty and for our freedom. This great, great, great state, I love this state. I love this state. No, you know what, Arizona’s been good to me from the beginning, from the beginning, from day one, right? We had the big victory. My first speech was in Arizona. Right? Remember? Phoenix. Remember that? And we had this big convention hall. I said, “How the hell are you going to fill it?” And we had that thing packed and there were lines outside. They couldn’t get in. I said, “Wow.” And that’s when the fake news started saying, “What the hell is going on with this Trump guy?” Right? Remember that in Phoenix? The big convention center was packed and there were thousands and thousands of people. It was my first speech. And they started saying, “What’s that all about?” Even I said, “What’s that all about?” Right? But I’m glad we all did it and we did it together. And this was the first place, Arizona. Thank you very much. Thank you. This great state was settled by some of the toughest men and strongest women ever to walk the face of the earth. Arizona’s where Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday became American legends. Wyatt Earp. It’s where the great American West became the American dream. And Arizona is the state where generations of pioneers and prospectors, miners and ranchers, cowboys and cattle hands, marshals and law men, tamed the frontier, braved the blazing sun like I’m doing right now. You’re going to see me tomorrow, I’m going to look like a lobster. You’re going to say, “Look what we did to him.” They said, “Would you like to wear a hat?” I said, “There’s no way I’m wearing a hat.” We got to show strength, right? Strength. And show the entire world how the west was won. This is it. They helped make America into the greatest nation in the history of the world, and the best is yet to come. It’s happening. It’s happening. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of Arizona, we have made America powerful again. We have made America wealthy again, stock market. We have made America strong again, our military. We have made America proud again. We have made America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you very much. Thank you, Arizona. Get out and vote. Get out and vote. Thank you.

"91","10-20-20","Thank you very much. Hello, Erie. Remember that great victory we had? What a victory. 14 days from now, we’re going to win the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and we are going to win four more years in the White House .with your vote, we will continue to cut your taxes, cut regulations, support our great police, protect our second amendment, defend our borders, keep jobs and wealth in America where it belongs. Thank you. We will deliver record prosperity, epic growth and you know that? have you seen what’s been going on? How well we’re doing? Did you see the recent poll just came out? 56% of the people want to be here, not four years ago. They want to be with us in what we’re calling… we’re rounding the turn of the pandemic. 56%, and it’s a record. Epic job growth, safe vaccines that quickly end the pandemic. It’s ending. Normal life, that’s all we want. You know what we want? Normal life. Normal life will finally resume and next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country. This is an election between the Trump super recovery, which is happening right now and a Biden depression. If he gets elected, you will have a depression the likes of which you’ve never seen. You know he’s going to double, triple and now quadruple your taxes. I don’t think so. I think I know the people of Erie pretty well. They don’t like that. It’s a choice between our plan to kill the virus or Biden’s plan to kill the American dream. That’s what he’d be doing. Biden will delay therapies, postpone the vaccine, prolong the pandemic, close your schools, shut down our country. By the way, Pennsylvania’s been shut down long enough. Get your governor to open up Pennsylvania. Get your governor to open it up. He will massively raise your taxes, bury you in regulations, dismantle your police departments, dissolve our borders, confiscate your guns, second amendment. Oh, you’re so lucky I’m president. You wouldn’t have a second amendment. Eliminate private healthcare, terminate religious liberty, destroy the suburbs. I’m saving the suburbs. Knocked out the regulation. No, you don’t like projects being next to you beautiful house, your American dream. So much for the American dream. Joe Biden will ban fracking and abolish Pennsylvania Energy. How many times did he say, “You’re fracking.” Mining industries will be outlawed, exiled, eradicated, and totally extinguished. And you know it because it’s not up to Sleepy Joe. He’s Gonzo. It’s up to the others of the party. Joe Biden has repeatedly pledged to ban fracking, right? You’ve all heard it. Have you heard it? Till he got the nomination then he came to Pennsylvania. He said, “Oh, well, I guess it’s okay.” It’s always what they say first. His running mate, the most liberal member of the US Senate, sponsors the $100 trillion… Think of that 100 trillion. If we had a great year for a hundred years, we couldn’t make a $100 trillion. The $100 trillion socialist green new deal, which would eliminate fossil fuels. At this very moment, Biden’s website includes a pledge to mandate net zero carbon emissions, which means he would end all fracking. It’s what he said. He said it for a year and a half, he said it. Under the Obama-Biden administration, more than 40% of all coal mining jobs will be destroyed. Totally gone. You know what’s happened? I mean, did you see what they did to West Virginia and other places, including Pennsylvania when they were here? Don’t forget. They’d been here for eight years before me. If they did a good job, I would have never run. I didn’t need this. I didn’t need this. Although, we’re having a good time, and we’re doing a good job. No, but it’s true. If they did a good job, I wouldn’t have run. Thank you. Thank you. There’s a lot of people. There’s a lot of people. I always want the cameras to show. They never like to show. They don’t like to talk about it. You can hear how big these crowds are. By the way, in all fairness to Erie, all over the country, it makes you feel good all over the country. The biggest crowds anyone’s ever had, bigger than what we had four years ago. Bigger. Oh, and you have-Leslie Stahl’s not going to be happy. The Democrat party hates fracking. They hate coal, good, beautiful, clean coal. They hate American energy and Joe Biden will shut it all down. He’s going to. Tonight. I want to do something. I want to give you. This is an original Donald Trump Broadway play. I had it done specifically… First time I’ve ever pulled it out. I had it done specifically for the people of Erie because you guys like energy. You like being energy independent. Do you like that? Energy… doesn’t that sound… We don’t need all these far away lands and everything else. We are now energy independent, and we’re going to keep it that way. Take a look at this clip. We had it made up, and I think you’ll like. First time I’ve ever done this, right? First time. Go ahead. Wherever it is, put it up. What we don’t show is his more current version. “Oh, yes, we’ll have fracking.” The fake news, they don’t do anything about it. They don’t even talk to him about it. But right now he’s got bigger problems than fracking, I think. You know what it’s called? You know what his problem? It’s called the laptop from hell. The laptop from hell. To all the people of Pennsylvania, hear this warning: If Biden’s elected, he will wipe out your energy industry. You have a million jobs. Just like he wiped out your steel industry and I brought it back. I brought it back. Only by voting for me, can you save your fracking in Pennsylvania. We are going to have a great time because you are going to reject the radical left. The United States, and I say it, and I’ll say it a thousand times, the United States will never be a socialist nation. Think of it. Here we are in Erie. People as far as the eye can see. Look at that. I mean, it’s a great honor. It’s a great honor. It’s a great honor for all of us. We’re all in this together. We’re all in it. As long as I’m president, we will remain the number one producer of energy anywhere in the world. You know we’re now number one in the world with Pennsylvania. You, Texas, we have some great… How about North Dakota does a great job? North Dakota, Oklahoma, so many different… Ohio does a phenomenal job. Phenomenal. A couple of Ohioans and they have to have the fracking and they have to have the energy and we need the energy. You looked at your car. When did you think you were going to see $2 a gallon and less. You didn’t think you were going to see that. That’s like a tax cut. At the same time, our energy industry is vibrant. Last year, I visited the Shell petrochemical plant in Beaver County, the largest investment in your state’s history. Our opponents will put it out of business. They want to put it out of business. I don’t think that’s a great idea. Joe Biden has made a corrupt bargain exchange for his party’s nomination. He’s handed control of his party over to socialists, I added another word, communists, Marxists, left-wing extremists, and they’re full of hate and rage and scorn for the middle-class, and for everybody, frankly, for the middle-class and for everybody. The Biden Harris, Kamala, you like Kamala? Kamala. I’ll tell you. Did our Vice President do a great job? He did. Did a great job. I said, “Mike, was too easy.” But the Biden Harris agenda is projected to slash the typical American’s income by $6,500. This is in the Wall Street Journal today. A Nightmare for Pennsylvania family, $6,500. And that’s just, cut it down, what you could be making if you do this and what we’re doing, because for the last 47 years, Joe Biden has been outsourcing your jobs, offshoring your factories and selling out the American worker. And who knows it better than Pennsylvania? Look at all the empty halts that you still have despite all the jobs we’ve brought back. America lost 10,000 factories while he was Vice President. He has no clue, by the way. Just so you understand, he has no clue. How many? Oh, that’s okay. He’s a servant of the globalists, lobbyists, wealthy donors and Washington vultures who got rich bleeding America dry. You know, I said the other day, I never thought of it because they’re raising a lot of money, $300 million. I could be the king of all fundraisers. I would be the greatest that ever lived, the President of the United States. All they have to do is give me a list of the top hundred companies. I’ll call the President of everyone. They will pay me whatever I want. I would set every record. The problem is I’d owe them. Because when they call and they have a problem for a lot more money than we’re talking about, it’s hard to say, “Hey, they were nice. They treated you good.” I don’t want to do that. I don’t want to do that. We don’t need the money. I don’t want to do that. I don’t want to do that. But when you see them raise $300, $350 million in a month and a half, you know deals are being made. Just so you understand, deals are being made, big deals, deals. I mean, look at the deals that he’s making for himself. Okay? But deals are being made. In 2016, Pennsylvania voted to fire this depraved political establishment and you elected an outsider as President who is finally putting America first. America first. The fact is whether you like it or not, whether you want to hear it or not. Joe Biden is a corrupt politician. He’s a corrupt politician. And smoking gun emails show that the Biden family sold the Vice Presidency for a very, very substantial amount of money, more money than anybody would believe. He let China plunder your jobs while his family raked in millions of dollars from China and foreign nations. The Bidens got rich while Pennsylvania got robbed and so did the rest of our country. Desperately trying to cover up everything. They don’t want to hear speeches like this. They don’t want to [inaudible 00:21:12] about it. [inaudible 00:04:16]. … Media, the big tech giants, the Washington swamp and the Democrat party is a part of all of them, every single one of them. They flood your communities with criminal aliens, drugs and crime, while they live behind beautiful gated compounds. They try to take away your guns, second amendment, they want to take it away, while they enjoy private security that’s fully armed. They support crippling lockdowns like your Governor is doing, while their jobs and their industries remain totally exempt. And it’s time to send a message to these wealthy liberal hypocrites by delivering Joe Biden, sleepy Joe, a thundering defeat on November 3rd. You got to get out and vote. Pennsylvania, you got to get out and vote. You know, if we win Pennsylvania, we win the whole thing. We win the whole thing. I mean, it’s crazy. They’re saying, “Oh, it’s his home state.” It’s not his own state. He left you when he was nine. Right? His parents. I’m not blaming him for that. But you know, he likes to go over and, “Yeah, yeah, it’s my home state.” It’s not his home state. I actually went to college in Pennsylvania, okay, so I think I have more in common. But it’s not his home state. He comes from a place called Delaware and he never leaves Delaware. [inaudible 00:22:43] Delaware, too. But he never leaves. Here, he’s making another speech, well he doesn’t make many speeches, either. He took a five day lid. You know what a lid is? I never heard lid. Lid is like, they put the lid like a garbage can. Right? They put the lid. He took a five day lid. I mean, this guy, all he does is like stay home. You know why? You know why? Because he can’t take any questions now from the press. He can’t take any questions. How about yesterday? He finally went outside. He went to get an ice cream and the press are [inaudible 00:06:19], these are all killers. I mean, there they are. Look, the fake news. They’re standing there. And all they wanted to know, think of me, they’re screaming at me a… All they wanted to know, “What flavor ice cream do you like?” Well, I like vanilla and chocolate. Thank you.” They don’t ask me those questions. If I don’t sound like a typical Washington politician, it’s because I’m not a politician. And if I don’t always play by the rules of the Washington establishment, it’s because I was elected to fight for you and nobody has ever fought for you harder than I have. That I can tell you. I’m fighting so hard because I love my country. I love you, by the way. But I love my country. Thank you. Thank you. And this is a tough group in front. The last time they said that, last time this guy said that to another man, I’d have [inaudible 00:24:37] you’d be dead a long time ago. But because I’m determined to ensure that the forgotten men and women of this country, remember, they showed up four years ago, and they’re showing up now. You see what’s going on. Do you see the lines? Do you see what’s happening all over the country? They still don’t want to report it. This is going to be bigger than four years ago. There’s more enthusiasm. The crowds are bigger. They’ll never be forgotten again, not after this one. They tried to find out who are all these people that showed up last time. Now they’re finding out again, except even more so. No, you see what’s going on though with the lines and everything. And then they have the phony fake ballots all over the place. They’re throwing them in the garbage can. Oh, they happen to have the name Trump on them. Isn’t that shocking? How about the ones that were printed without my name on it? Right? They had everything on it. They had every race. They had everything. You had the Senate. You had everything. They forgot to put me down. Oh, thank you. And then they say, “He’s against freedom.” Oh, it’s wild. The Biden Harris Warren police would be a catastrophe for public safety. You know, I think I have every single endorsement, even New York finest, New York City’s finest. We love it our finest. Is the mic ready? Yes. I wonder who did that to our mic. I don’t believe it was Joe. You know who it was? Crooked Hillary. Must have been. I think it was probably crooked Hillary. But Kamala, Kamala, by the way, she will not be your first woman president. She will not be. Can’t let that happen. There’ll be a woman president. You can not let that happen. Harris even urged their supporters to donate to a fund that bailed out rioters right out of jail, including attempted cop killers. I will always stand with the heroes of law enforcement. So will you. And Biden’s policies would also decimate our seniors. Biden is pledging mass amnesty and free federal healthcare. Remember, he did that at a stage. You remember? Look, she’s shaking her head. She remembers. Remember when he put up his hand? You know, after 47 years, he knew it was not the right thing to do, but everybody else was raising. You know, they’re all radical left. And he felt very uncomfortable. He looked, he looked over there and they were all over the place. His people, they were all-We just won the election. He knows they don’t get a free Rolls Royce. He lied to the American people. Oh, these are sick people. Thank goodness their ratings, CNN ratings, did you see them? They’re so bad. Fredo, all these people. The ratings are so bad. Their ratings are terrible. Thank goodness. But he will obliterate your Medicare, your social security. I will always protect your Medicare and your social security, as I said four years ago. I’m also proud that here in Pennsylvania, your Medicare Advantage, you know that. Everybody has it. Some people have it. The premiums have decreased, listen to this, under our management, 43% since I took office. Where do you hear that? We will always defend our seniors and we defend them like nobody else can. The battle against the China virus, the China virus, that’s what it is. It’s a China. You know, they call it COVID. They call it all different names. It’s the China virus. China, maybe the China plague. We launched the largest mobilization since World War II. I’ll tell you what. The way they cover it, we have done such an incredible, we saved millions of lives. They refuse to cover it. Not for me, but for the people, the admirals, the generals, Mike Pence, everybody that works so hard on this, and they refuse to acknowledge it. We made a lot of really bad governors look good. And some good governors do just fine, but a lot of bad governors, we made them look good. Early on, we took aggressive action. We saved so many lives. Remember it was supposed to be 2.2 million. Under a scenario, it could have been more than. I took rapid action to ban travel from China and from Europe, heavily infected areas. And by the way, the scientists said, “Oh, don’t do it.” Two months later, they were saying, “Lucky he did do it.” Biden opposed both of these life saving decisions. You remember he said, “He’s xenophobic.” I said, “Joe, Joe, what does it mean, Joe?” He goes, “He doesn’t know.” Only in Pennsylvania. He goes, “He doesn’t know”.” Well, you’re right about that. We pioneered incredible therapies. Excuse me, here I am. That was quick. That was quick. No, great doctors. We have great doctors and reduced the fatality rate 85%. Think of that. And I’m working to make the antibody treatment that I received available to anybody that needs it free. And it’s getting very close to getting approved. We will have 100 million vaccine doses before the end of the year, maybe sooner than that, maybe substantially before the Biden lockdown. He’s willing to lock you down. You guys aren’t even open yet. What the hell is going on with your state? You know, Florida is open. Florida had a surge. Great governor, surge, went down. Arizona had a surge, went down, great governor. Texas had a surge, went down. You guys never opened. What the hell is going on in Pennsylvania, right? The Biden lockdown will crush America. We will crush the virus. We’re doing that. We’re crushing the virus. Look at our numbers compared to Europe. You know, they always said, “Oh Europe, Europe, Europe.” Look at our numbers compared, and we had the biggest of any country, the biggest comeback. We came back faster. We went down less, economically came back faster. If you want depression, doom and despair, vote for sleepy Joe Biden. And boredom. You know the great thing. I always say, someday these people, look at all them. Look at all of those cameras. You know what I say, someday, they’re going to get smart. They’re going to endorse President Trump, because if you had sleepy Joe, nobody’s going to be interested in politics anymore. That’s going to be the end of that. They will all go out of business. They should have gone out of business four years ago. Then I came along. If you want open schools, an open economy and a safe, healthy, thriving country. Vote for me. We’re going to do it. We’re doing it now. We’re doing it. Now we’re joined today by a few of my friends. I’ll tell you this one guy, he got it right from the beginning. That’s right. How did you know that? He’s a warrior. He’s tough as hell. He could have only been grown in Pennsylvania because he’s that kind of a guy. He said a long time ago when I knew him, it was a year before the election, and I said this is four years plus one. I said, “How do you think we’re going to do?” He said, “Sir, you’re going to win.” I said, “How the hell do you know that? I just started.” The escalator ride wasn’t too old. Right? The famous escalator with our First Lady. They love our First Lady. Wasn’t too old. We had just come down and a man named Congressman Mike Kelly said, “Sir, you’re going to win in a landslide.” Come up here, Mike. Come up. Come on. I don’t know. Get up. He said, “I can’t do it again.” They’ll figure it out. Don’t hurt yourself though, Mike. Don’t prove everything, Mike. Hey, fellas, could you help the man? Just give him a hand. Take your time, Mike. Don’t hurt yourself. Can you imagine? He’s trying to climb over a barrier to show [inaudible 00:00:33]. We don’t want to hurt our Mike. Right from the beginning, he’s been with me. Great guy. Come her, Mike. And also my Pennsylvania Campaign Chair, done a fantastic, really a fantastic job. Bernie Comfort. Bernie. Thank you. Great job. Great job. Are you okay? Don’t touch. Don’t touch me, Mike, we’ll get in trouble with the media. They’ll say, “They touched each other.” Do you ever see this? If he would have done that … I saved you, Mike. Maybe I saved your political career. They would have had front page story of our two hands touching. Mike, say a few words, please. What a great guy. That was not a bad job? Not a bad job. He’s a great guy though, he really is. You’re lucky to have him. Good job. You know, he shows up without the jacket. I feel a little guilty, Mike, without … you’re not called Mike [inaudible 00:36:56], right? Don’t be too brave, we got to keep him around, right, Mike? Great job. I appreciate it. Under my administration, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world, and now we’re doing it again. In my first three years, we increased family income over $6,000. Listen to this, more than five times, the gains in all eight years under the previous administration. Think of that. In just a short period of time. African-American unemployment, Hispanic-American, unemployment, and Asian-American unemployment all reached their lowest levels in the history of our country. Think of that. We lifted nearly 7 million Americans out of poverty, a record. Including nearly 1.2 million African Americans, out a poverty since April, just since April, just now we created a record, never happened like this, 11. 4 million brand new American jobs. That’s never happened before. And you know, you were hearing, it sounds terrible to me when I say it, but you were hearing about 38% unemployment, right? 38, you hearing 42%. So it was … yes, fake new. Hey, thank goodness. But you know what? It was two weeks ago, 7.8%. Now 7.8, well, we’re at 3.4 and 3.5, I don’t like to say 7.8, but when you think about it, they were saying, “We’re going to 42%.” You know, not our fault. We had this plague come in from China. We’re going to 42%, 38%. 7.8% and heading down rapidly. That’s pretty amazing when you think about it. Under Biden, it took 30 months to recover more than half of the jobs lost in a crisis. We did it in less than five months. We’ve spent the last four years reversing the damage Joe Biden inflicted over the last 47 years. You saw what he’s done. You know, it’s amazing. He’s always like, it’s not him, he’s not being critical, but he has writers. They say, “Let’s do this, that.” You know, have all this up. Vice-President Biden said, he has no idea what he said, but you know what I get … he didn’t leave long ago. He was here for eight years as vice-president and 47 years plus as a politician in Washington. Think of it. And he’s always like, “Why didn’t you do this?” Why the hell didn’t he do it? Why didn’t he do it? 47 years, Joe, why didn’t you do it? He supported NAFTA, TPP, which would have destroyed your industry. And China’s entry into the World Trade Organization. One cruel betrayal after another. It’s true. I mean, what he’s done. For decades or politicians spent trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign wars, and defending foreign borders. Now we’re doing our borders. Do you like that better? But now we’re finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities, and we are bringing our jobs, our factories, and our troops, our beautiful, beloved trope, we’re bringing them all back home. It’s time. 19 years to save our auto industry. I withdrew from the last administration’s Transpacific Partnership. Pennsylvania gained, Michigan, auto factories, auto plants being built all over Michigan. Ohio. There wasn’t a plan built in 42 years. Now they’re being built all over the place. In Japan, I told the prime minister, you have to give us plants. You can’t just keep sending us cars. You got to make them over here. And they started and you’re a big beneficiary of it. To defend our steel, that aluminum workers, I imposed very historic tariffs on dumped steel, right? And US steel, all of your places started doing great. I ended the NAFTA nightmare and signed the brand new USMCA, just kicked in. You know how I know it’s good? Because the other two countries aren’t so happy. It’s good. They took advantage of us for a long time. I took the toughest ever action to confront China’s rampant theft of American jobs. Nobody has ever done. And you know what? Nobody’s ever done anything like this to China. We’re taking in billions. Right now we’re taking in billions, billions and billions of dollars. It affects you a little bit. We gave $28 billion to our farmers because they were targeted by China. And that was just a small fraction of what I took in. Under my leadership we achieved the most secure border, Southern border in US history. So we’re building 10 miles. You know, the wall is going to be completed very soon. And we had radical opposition to the wall, radical opposition. We’ll be at 500 miles very soon and will be completed with the wall. And by the way, Mexico, you know, they keep saying, Mexico is paying for the wall. They understand, that they’re paying for the wall. Mexico is paying for it and it’s very high just like I said it would be. And it actually goes down very deep. You know why? Two reasons actually, number one, to hold it up. Number two, to stop the tunnels. My opponent’s immigration plan is the most extreme proposal ever put forward by a presidential candidate. Biden would eliminate US borders. How about that? Do you like that idea? Okay. Just think of it from a … How the hell do you have a country if you don’t have borders? He would eliminate … and you know, that’s signed in the manifesto with Bernie Sanders. Crazy Bernie. Bernie, I’ll tell you what, he’s one of the greatest losers. And I mean that in a very nice way. Twice they took it away from him, right? Hillary took it away. And then Elizabeth Pocahontas Warren took it away. Because she stayed in on Super Tuesday. She took enough votes away, so he didn’t win any states. And then he goes back to the Senate like nothing happened. This guy. I think he should be given … you know, in school, when I was a young guy in school, sportsmanship of the year. I never happened to receive that. I got other awards. I never got the best sportsmanship award. But Bernie Sanders should be given sportsman of the year. Sportsmanship, I guess, right? No, no. It’s amazing. This happened to him twice. Is Bernie running again in four more years? Bernie, are you running again? Crazy Bernie. But no, but they signed, they didn’t sign. I guess they have this deal, the manifesto, they agreed. Biden would eliminate and she’s more liberal than him. You know, she’s more liberal. And there’s nobody that treated Biden worse than Kamala. That’s why I said, “Why would he ever pick her?” There’s nobody that treated him worse. Biden would eliminate US borders by implementing nationwide catch and release, which I ended. If it’s okay with you, you know what I did? You catch them, what do you do? They’re murderers, they’re rapists. You catch them and then you have to release them. This is called catch … this is a serious … this was a Democrat program headed up by crying Chuck Schumer. He’s the one. You catch them. And you release them into the country. And you say in four and a half years, please come back for a trial. Nobody comes back. A couple of really stupid ones come back. Other than making every community into a sanctuary city and suspending all removals of illegal aliens. They want to suspend, in this manifesto, no more moving out illegal aliens, even if they’re really bad, including no violent criminals. You catch MS-13, can’t move them out. Thank you very much. We’re living with them. This is what these people want. This is the most important election in the history of our country. Look, you know, we can play games and we can be nice and we can have a good time. You think I need to be standing out here in 50 degree weather, looking at Mike in a shirt, and he feels better about it than I do. Right Mike? No, this is the most important election in the history of our country. We can not allow this to happen. We’re going to win. We’re going to win so big. I think we’re going to win … you know the lines? The lines are record setting. The lines are big. The lines are big. There’s a lot of Trump, Trump … you know, a lot of people, great Americans, they never liked who they were voting for. They didn’t vote, they just didn’t vote. And they’re on line right now. There are a lot of people out there and it’s looking good. It’s early, but it’s looking good. Get out and vote. Most important election, Mike, we’ve ever had. I really believe it. And you know what? Four or five months ago when we started this whole thing, because you know, before the plague came in, I had it made. I wasn’t coming to Erie. I mean, I have to be honest, there was no way I was coming. I didn’t have to. I would’ve called you and said, “Hey, Erie. You know, if you have a chance, get out and vote.” We had this thing won. We were so far up. We had the greatest economy ever, greatest jobs, greatest everything. And then we got hit with the plague and I had to go back to work. Hello, Erie, may I please have your vote? Right? I love Erie. No. Hey, we had a big deal in Erie. We had a big deal in Erie, right? This was not supposed to be a Trump thing. There’s a lot of Democrats, but they’re Democrats that love Trump because I love them. And you know what? You’re workers, you’re like me. We work, we work, we work. But that was a pretty big upset, wasn’t it? Big, big upset. But a Biden wins, your borders are gone, which means your healthcare is gone, the middle-class is gone, your safety is gone, your country is gone. That’s what’s going to happen. And don’t think it can happen. Take a look at Venezuela. This could be same ideology as what they’re talking about. This could be a Venezuela, but much, much, much bigger. It could happen. It could happen. You see these people, you see what they’re saying? You see Portland where they have anarchists through the streets. And it’s all Democrat run areas, no Republican areas. It’s all Democrat run areas. That’s where you have … with Portland, it’s anarchists. Look at what’s happened to our beautiful New York. Since I’ve been gone, think of it. You know what? It’s like three and a half years. If you think of it. I think what I can say is if I would’ve stayed in New York, that wouldn’t have happened. It’s very … But look at what’s happened to New York in a few years. What’s happened in New York, what’s happened to Chicago. Look at what’s going on in Baltimore. And just remember this, with Obama Biden, they had nothing but problems. Look at Baltimore. Remember how bad that was? Ferguson. Look at St. Louis, look at Oakland, look at all the problems. You know, they act like, “Oh, it was … .” It was horrible. And you know, I say it all the time. If they were any good, I wouldn’t have run. And if they were any good, if I did run, I couldn’t have won, right? But they were no good. They did a rotten job. They did a lousy job and Joe is not equipped right now, no longer. He never really was. You know, we used to call him 1% Joe and that was in prime time. How about this? And in non-prime time, he ends up getting the nomination. Figure that one out. To secure our border, I took the corrupt media. We had to take it on and they are corrupt. The powerful special interests and the open borders lunatics, because they’ll destroy our country. In just three years, we removed over a half a million criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of more than 145,000 assaults, 40,000 sex crimes and 6,000 murders. 6,000 murders. We got them the hell out. Some we had to keep because we didn’t even want them out, they were too dangerous. Because we don’t want them coming back. And I want to thank ICE and I want to thank our great border patrol. Always law enforcement, but ICE and border patrol. Under a Biden administration, these criminals would be set free. Under my administration, these criminals are sent home or they have to be put in prison. We invested $2.5 trillion in the US military. We now have the greatest equipment we’ve ever had. We are the envy of Russia and China and everybody in the world. We have the best missiles and rockets and tanks and planes, F-35 Stealth. You can’t see it. Other than that, it’s not so great. You can’t see it. I went to one of the pilots, I said, “How good is this plane?” “Well, it’s really good.” “Why is it good?” “Because the enemy can’t see it.” I said, “I don’t know too much about what you do. Sounds good to me.” And for our great veterans, we passed VA Choice and VA Accountability. We killed the leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi. We killed the worst mass murderer terrorist in many, many generations. Soleimani is dead. Killed many soldiers, many people. I withdrew from the last administration’s disastrous Iran nuclear deal. By the way, if and when we win, my first call is going to be from the heads of Iran, and they’re going to say, “Let’s make a deal.” Their economy, went from being strong, they were all over the world, terrorism. Now their economy is totally tanked with our sanctions and other things. And they’re down, GDP, think of this, GDP down 27%, nobody’s ever even heard of it. And I don’t want that, I want them to be a good sell, they can not have a nuclear weapon. They cannot have a nuclear weapon, but I want them to be good. I want them to be strong, I want them to have great country. The first call will be Iran. As soon as we win, they’re going to call and we’ll make a deal. And then others will also call, they’re all hoping. China, oh China, China wants us to … Oh China. They want Joe Biden so badly, you have no idea. They want … They are dying for Joe Biden. The one they don’t want is, they don’t want Trump, they’ve had enough for Trump. Tens of billions of dollars we get. I recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. We don’t want Trump, please. We’ve had enough of Trump, let’s try somebody new, this isn’t working. Hey look, China has ripped us off more than any country in history. And by the way, plenty of our allies rip us off too, between trade and military and everything else, I could go into that. I could speak about that all night long. But nobody has ripped us like China for many, many, long before Obama, in all fairness and Biden, long before them. They’ve ripped us off … Where’s Hunter? I don’t know, that’s a good-Where’s Hunter? Remember we said that, “Where’s Hunter?” Then we made the T-shirt, it was a number one selling T-shirt. Where’s Hunter? What happened to Hunter? Where’s Hunter? I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, 52 years they tried to do it, I did it in about two hours. I even got nominated for three Nobel Peace Prizes. And for all different things, one’s the Middle East, one is Kosovo, Serbia. We’re doing a deal with these countries, I say, “Well, you guys have been fighting and killing each other.” We’re doing a deal. Let’s get them to be like, let’s not kill each other. And we worked out a deal, a beautiful economic deal between two places that just killed each other for years and years. And it just seems so easy and so natural, right? Anyway, in the Middle East, instead of all of the blood pouring all over the sand, we’re ending all of that and you see what’s happening, countries in joining left and right, no blood, we did it a different way. We did it … How many times was I criticized, “He can’t get it done that way.” You see this guy, John Kerry who’s grossly incompetent? The only time he ever left the negotiating table, was to go into a bicycle race, he was 73 years old. And he fell, he broke his leg and his arm. Other than that, it was a wonderful day, riding a bicycle. And I pledged that I will never be in a bicycle race, okay? I did more in 47 months than Joe Biden did in 47 years, that’s true. A vote for Republicans is about for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans. A vote for Republicans and a vote for me, is a vote for the American dream. That’s what it is, it’s a vote for the American. And in conclusion, we’ll make us a little shorter, it’s like about 40 degrees. I don’t want people … I don’t want to lose anybody, you got to go vote. So, got to go a little shorter because you got to go home. And I see, even Mike he’s so brave, he’s had to freeze his ass off, off camera. He said, “Okay, look, I proved my point. Let’s say, President, let’s get me the hell out of here.” Over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we will end our reliance on China once and for all, we’re already doing that. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. Banned. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms, Second Amendment. And if they get in, you will lose your Second Amendment. Remember that when you’re getting ready to press Trump. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens and we will keep America out of these ridiculous, horrible, endless wars. They’re endless. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency, already signed, starts on January 1st, it’ll be bigger than healthcare, watch this. And further reduce the cost of prescription drugs, which I’ve done with favorite nations, the drug companies do not like me too much. You will have drug prices going down 50, 60, 70, 80%. Could you imagine if he were in this position and people would go up to him, “Mr. President, you’ve done a great job on drug prices.” “Oh, really? What happened?” “They’re down 82%, Sir.” “Really? I can’t believe it.” You better give me the credit, dammit, I’ll tell you. What I’ve gone through, the drug companies, they’re spending a fortune on fake ads. They don’t want me. They don’t want me. China doesn’t want me. Iran doesn’t want me. Nobody wants me. Nobody. Erie, Erie wants me. Erie wants me. And we’ll always protect patients with pre-existing conditions, always. America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. That’s already moving along. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools, right? We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our great national motto, it’ll never be changed. They want to change that. They want to take certain words out, like the word God, okay. In God we trust, we’ll always keep it. For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now, you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of Pennsylvania, always will. Great state, great place, a lot of friends. So, get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, get your boss, right? Get your boss, “Come on boss, we got to vote.” And get out and vote. You tend to vote very late, which is good, I understand that. But it’s just the norms and you tend to vote late, get out and vote, get out and vote. This is the biggest election of our lifetime, get out and vote. From Scranton to Allentown, from Pittsburgh to Harrisburg and from Eastern to right here in Erie, we stand on the shoulders of red blooded, American patriots who poured out their heart, sweat and soul, to secure liberty and defend our freedom. Pennsylvania is the state, where our founding fathers to declared American independence. Think of it, Pennsylvania, think of what you represent as a state. What state … Honestly, and we can say it to the other states, I love them, they’ve been great to me. They voted for us, everything, but what state’s done some of the things that have taken place in Pennsylvania? It’s where the army weathered its brutal winter at Valley Forge, where general George Washington led his men on a daring mission across the Delaware and where our union was saved by the incredible heroes at Gettysburg, right? I mean, who can say these things and these names, right? Gettysburg, these names. This is the place where generations of tough, strong Pennsylvania miners, steelers, factory workers, forged the greatest nation in the history of the world. And believe me, the best is yet to come. It’s coming. It’s all happening. The best is yet to come. Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people, we are returning power to you. And I said that a long time ago, when we started. It was being taken away, I just didn’t know quite how deep the swamp was. It’s a little deeper, a little more treacherous than I thought, but we’re beating them. Oh, well their head will explode on November 3rd. Can you imagine? And then, you know what’s going to happen? You know what’s going to happen? I think they’re finally going to say, “Okay, that’s enough. Let’s go.” I think by that time, they’re going to have it. They will have had it. He goes, “They better.” With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God, and together with the incredible, and I mean that, I know you well. A lot of time in this incredible land, this beautiful place, this place of history. The incredible people of Pennsylvania, we have made America powerful again, our military had never been like this. Remember at the beginning, when the overrated general said to me, “Sir, we have no ammunition.” I said, “No president should ever have that.” No president should ever hear those words, “Sir, we have no ammunition.” We now have so much ammunition that even Mike would be impressed. So, we’ve made it powerful again. We’ve made America wealthy again. Stock market, new records, your 401ks, everybody happy with their 401k? You want to see your 401ks crash? It was on today. Varney, Varney, you know Stuart. He had a gentlemen on, he said, “You know, if Trump gets in, the market’s going to go through the roof. If Trump loses and this other guy gets in, you’re going to have a problem like you’ve never seen before.” And I agree. Your 401ks, your stocks, you want to see them drop like a rock? If you want to have some fun with your family, explaining, “Why is it down 80% dad? We don’t love you anymore, dad.” Now, your 401ks are doing great. Everything’s doing great. We’re going to be in a position very soon, like we’ve never been in, even better than we were a year ago. We’ve made America strong again. We have made America proud again. We have made America safe again and we will make America great again. Thank you very much, Pennsylvania. Go out and vote. Go out and vote. Thank you, Pennsylvania. Thank you, thank you.

"92","10-21-20","Wow. This is a big crowd. This is one hell of a big crowd. Well, I want to thank everybody. Thank you, Gastonia. Gastonia. Thank you, Gastonia. Beautiful name. 13 days, can you believe it? 13 days. 13 days from now, and you see what’s going on and you see, boom, boom, boom. Oh, they’re getting a little nervous over there, the Deep State, the Democrats, all of these people that we’ve been dealing with, they’re getting a little bit nervous, aren’t they? Huh? We’re going to win this state. 13 days. This great, great state. And we’re going to win four more years in the White House. With your vote we will continue to cut taxes, cut regulations, lower drug prices like never before, support our great police and law enforcement, protect your incredible Second Amendment, defend our borders, maintain energy independence, and ensure more products are proudly stamped with the phrase, “Made in the USA.” And it’s happening now. We will deliver record prosperity, epic job growth, a very safe vaccine that’s coming very quickly. That pandemic is rounding the corner. They hate it when I say it. You turn onto this MSDNC and fake news CNN, all you hear is, “COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID.” That’s all they put on, because they want to scare the hell out of everyone. The more testing you have, the more cases. They say, “Cases are up.” Yeah, testing is up. We have more testing than India, China, and almost every other country put together. You could say it’s ridiculous. At the same time, we did a good job, but it shows a lot of cases. And thank you. He said, “Great job.” We did do a great job. Normal life will fully resume, and next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country. That’s where we’re headed. This election is a choice between a Trump super recovery or a Biden steep depression, and that’s what you’re going to have. It’s between a Trump boom or a Biden lockdown. He wants to lock you down. By the way, by the way, I love this state. You’ve got to get your Governor to open up your state here. You’re got to get him to open up. Open up your state, Governor, it’s time. You’ve been long enough. Watch November 4th, “North Carolina, we’re opening up.” November 4th. You know they’re only doing this for political reasons. Many, many states, big, big, powerful states, they’re open, they’re doing great. But your Governor doesn’t want to. And you look at Michigan. Michigan, we won in the Supreme Court. She had no Constitutional right to do what she did. The only one that had freedom in Michigan was her husband. He had plenty of freedom. He went swimming and he went boating whenever he wanted. Biden will delay therapies, postpone the vaccine, prolong the pandemic, close your schools, and shut down our country. And that’s what he’ll do. He will massively raise your taxes. He won’t even know he’s doing it, by the way, but let’s go into it. He has no clue, but that’s all right. Bury you in regulations, dismantle your police departments, dissolve our borders, confiscate your guns, that would be happening very quickly, eliminate private health care, 180 million people, private healthcare, they love it. They want to eliminate it. They want to go to socialized medicine. You too can go to a hospital ward and see how your cold is coming along. Wait for four or five days before you get in. Terminate religious liberty, destroy the suburbs, and slash defense spending, devastating North Carolina’s incredible military families. By the way, we’ve invested more in the military in the last three years than at any time in our nation’s history. All made in the USA. Joe Biden has made a corrupt bargain. In exchange for his party’s nomination, which he should have never gotten, if Pocahontas got out two days early instead of what she did to Crazy Bernie was unbelievable, and that vote doesn’t like [inaudible 00:07:07]. People aren’t showing up. I shouldn’t say this. This is too early, right? Oh, there they are. 61 from North Carolina. Some of the great women of the world. 61 times. Oh, oh, look at you. And you have your husbands with you tonight. Look at you. Look at you. Good. I asked him last time, “How many times have you gone?” 61. Thank you. Thank you. I love you too. So don’t explain. Thank you. That’s so nice. I said the other night, you’re going to make me cry. And one of these fake anchors said, ” Donald Trump started crying during his speech.” Not that that’s a bad thing. In fact, maybe it would be good if I did. Some people say, “Hey, why don’t you do that every once in a while? It wouldn’t be so bad.” No, the other thing they said, “Fake, fake people.” I joke and I say, “Women of the suburbs, please, please love me. I’ve done so good. I’ve done so good. I’ve done so good for you. Please, just like us.” You’re only kidding. I mean, I’m being sarcastic. But I mean it, because I’m saving your suburbs. I’m going to stop low income housing. I’m going to stop projects, and we’re going to stop crime from going into the suburbs. So I mean it. But I said, jokingly, the last time out, last time out, I said, “Women of the suburbs, please, please love me. I’ve done such a good job, please.” And on 60 Minutes, take 60 Minutes, she said, “You are begging for women to love you. You said, women, please, love you.” You’ll see. You’ll see. Wait until you see? We have a little surprise for 60 Minutes. No, it’s true. I won’t name the anchor. Do you know the anchor? Huh? No, no, she said, “Well, you were begging for women to love you.” I said, “No, no, that was sarcastic.” Remember I said, “Russia, Russia, Russia, if you’re listening, please give us,” whatever it was, Hillary’s emails or whatever. And then everybody laughed and I laughed, but they cut me off just before the end. And they said, “He was asking Russia for help.” These people are sick. Shifty Schiff and all that group, they are sick. So you see, from now on, when I say, “Women of the suburbs, please love me,” I’m going to have to say, “I’m only kidding. I’m only kidding,” because otherwise. But they’ll take that out too. Sleepy Joe Biden has handed control of his party over to socialist, communist, Marxists, and left wing extremists, and they’re filled with hatred, venom, and rage. The first thing Washington Democrats will do if Sleepy Joe is elected, is going to sleep, I guess. I had a leader that called me a really dynamic leader, called me up about two weeks ago, I said, “I don’t want to deal with him. He’s always going to be sleeping.” Can you imagine that? The word gets around. But the first thing Washington Democrats will do if Biden gets elected is pack the Supreme Court with radical left judges who will eliminate your Second Amendment and many other things. Life, look at the things they have to rule on. They will pack it. Somebody said 16. I said, “Why not 18? Why not 21, add 22?” And he’s got to also tell us who the judges are. He won’t tell. He won’t talk, because if he does, he’s going to totally lose the radical left. So he won’t say. He’s in his basement, you’re right about that. No, I go through these interviews, every question’s a total kill, right? Every question they’re going for the kill. And this guy walks out holding ice cream and the press is out there, the fake news, and they’re going, “What kind of ice cream are you eating?” “Uh, chocolate. I’m thinking vanilla too.” I say, “Why don’t they ever asking me those questions, right?” They don’t ask me those questions. If Biden wins, the flag burning demonstrators on the street will be running your federal government. Don’t worry, it’s not going to happen. It can’t happen. You know my statement, ” Our country will never be a socialist country. Never ever.” They’ll decide which businesses can exist and which will be outlawed. They will decide which rights you can keep and which are going to be revoked. They will re-educate your children, which they tried and we stopped, but they will do it. You saw what I did with the people that wanted to do a culture change, right? They’re all gone out of our military. They’re gone out of everything. But they’ll re-emerge. If you have the wrong leader, they’ll re-emerge quickly. They’ll order you to stay at home while letting rioters and MS-13 killers roam free without masks. Without masks. MS-13, doesn’t have to wear a mask. You ever see that? They riot, they loot, they do everything, no problem. You get together, you get together, that’s why we have outdoors, we always go outdoors, right? But they have a thing, you can’t do anything. You can’t go to church, right? You can’t go to church. Your kids can’t go to school, even though it’s 99.9%, 99.9. In fact, Barron had it. “Sir, he just tested positive.” “Who?” “Barron.” About 12 seconds later, “How’s he doing?” “Oh, he’s recovered.” “Oh good.” Let’s face it. They have stronger immune systems, stronger immune. They’re very powerful. I never realized how powerful children are. They will censor you, punish you, and persecute you for violating their speech codes and oppressive mandates. You’ve seen it. You’ve been saying what’s going on. But you know what? We’ve got the White House. We’re winning. That’s it. As long as we have that, and we’re knocking them out left and right. I wonder what’s going to happen. We win, they announce, “Ladies and gentlemen, Donald Trump has won the Presidency of the United States.” I think they’ll be very happy. They’re going to be very happy. No, they’ll be upset, and then there’ll be just fine, right? They’ll be just fine. They’ll be very thrilled. They’ll be thrilled. I’ll tell you this, I’ll tell you this, you know, I love this particular state, but I might not have come here so often, I’ve been all over your state, you better let me win. I mean, Laura and Eric, they had a beautiful daughter, granddaughter for me, and they named the granddaughter Carolina. Now, when I go to South Carolina, I could also give them some credit. No, it’s great. It’s a great place. Fine, that guy’s doing a good job. I don’t know where the hell he is. He’s always working. He’s back there someplace. Where is he? Oh, look. Come up, Mark. Come up. I’ll tell you, he has done a really great job. Looking at him. Central casting too. Central casting. He loves his state, I will tell you that. It took me three years to get him out of Congress. And we have another great friend of ours here, Mick Mulvaney. He’s really been great, Mick. He’s a South Carolina guy. And he’s a good man too. And we have some other warriors here. We have some of your Congressman and some others. So we’ll introduce them later. The hell with them. We’ll introduce them later. Just think of it, and I said this to them just a little while ago, I shouldn’t say it’s sad, because they’re going to say he was extremely sad, but it is sad, but just think of it, I said, “I’m all by myself and I’ve had to beat the fake news, lame stream media, and their partner, the Democrat Party, and now we find out without any doubt, we’ve had to beat the big tech giants. And add to that, we’ve had to beat that really stupid, dumb people, the Never Trumpers. We’ve had to beat the RINOS. That’s Republican In Name Only, RINO. I love that term, the RINO. Get a lot [inaudible 00:16:50] RINOS than we should have. [inaudible 00:16:54] and the consultants that I have defeated, almost everyone of these clowns. They all represented somebody. Don’t forget [inaudible 00:17:02] people running and every one of these clowns represented somebody. And I defeated them so badly that they’ve never gotten over it. They do commercials. These people are sick. They’re sick. They’re sad, sad people. And on top of everything else, we’ve had to soundly defeat, we’re in the process of doing it, it’s much deeper than I thought, the Deep Staters, right? We had to beat them [inaudible 00:17:29] swamp, and the swamp creatures are much deeper and much [inaudible 00:17:33]. And there is such a thing as the Deep State, who would think? But with all of those people, that’s a lot, and I stand here by myself and then I said to the people in the plane, wonderful, beautiful plane, it’s got more television sets than any plane in history, I saw you, “Look at the size of this craft.” They’re never going to report that. They never talk about it. They never talk about it. They never talk about it. They never talk about crowd size. You remember when we had the inauguration, I said, “We had the biggest crowd,” and then they show empty space and they show Barack Hussein Obama’s crowd? And I said, I think the word we used was audience, and that included all of the new things, all of the different things that we have coming out. Every week, there’s a new form of information coming out. So I think we had the largest audience anywhere in the world. But they show this field. Now, when I was speaking, it was full. But when they show the field, it was all empty. I said, “Wait a minute. I was speaking. It was full.” Well, they took the pictures about five or six hours early. They had everything roped off. And I said to my people, “We ought to bring that up every once in a while. “Oh sir, nobody cares about it.” I care about it. I care about it. No, they took the pictures way early, and when I was speaking, I’m looking at this thing all the way back, it was so beautiful. [inaudible 00:19:11] I guess, largest audience, and I think it was the largest audience. And we suffered. That was the first week. This was just the beginning. This was just the beginning. When I was speaking, it was packed just like this place. [inaudible 00:19:25]. It’s a lot of people. But I had it again too. I had a guy, his name was [inaudible 00:19:35] Washington Post. He goes to an arena and all of the arenas were packed. Now, we’re doing outdoor because of COVID, sometimes referred to as the China Virus, which I think is a far more accurate word. I mean, you could also use the corona word, but that sounds like a beautiful town in Italy. It’s not fair. This is the China Plague or the China virus. That’s where it came from. We have to be accurate. And we were really doing well against China. We still are by the way, but we were doing so well. Hey, do you remember that for years, for 10 years, you heard China was going to supplant us in 2019, right? 2019, that were going to be bigger than us, their economy. Well, that didn’t work out too well for them. We were beating them by leaps and bounds. And then we got hit with the plague. No sooner had the ink dried on a great China deal. We made a wonderful deal. It was great. In fact, they ordered the largest amount, two weeks ago of corn, soy beans and beef, cattle, beef that we’ve ever had because they want to keep me happy, because they know I’m not satisfied. This is no good what happened. This is no good what they did to us. No good. The ink hadn’t even dried on our trade deal with China. Wonderful deal. And this happened. They should have been stopped at China. They should have been able to stop it. They stopped it from going into the rest of China, but they didn’t stop it from going into Europe, the United States and the rest of the world, right? We’re going to find out why too. But the American people are with me. So, I stand alone. And I said to these people, I apologize. You mind if I said I instead of we? Because it is a group of very loyal people. I said plays much better when I say I, but we do have a great group of people, but we do. We’re standing sort of alone against all of these people. I mean, I saw Adam Schiff, this guy, the watermelon head. I say, no, he’s like a watermelon head. No dummy, no dummy. And he doesn’t believe it. But he said the other day about Biden with the laptop from hell. We call it the laptop. He said, and he goes up before the mic, this is Adam Shifty Schiff. “This was caused by Russia, Russia. Russia caused this. They created this disinformation,” he said. He should be. Honestly, that guy should be locked up. And because he’s in Congress. No, it’s true. You know, because he’s, remember when he said I had this perfect phone call with the president of Ukraine. I’m the only one that could get impeached over a phone call. That was perfect. Remember, Shifty Schiff got up? Then he started repeating it eight times quid pro quo, “And you will this. And you will that. And you will listen.” Fortunately, we had beautiful transcribers that transcribe that call. Can you imagine if we didn’t have? It would have been my word against Shifty Schiff and all of the horrible human beings over there. They died when they found out we had a transcription, remember? They wanted to know, how do we get out of this one? So we had to beat that one off too, but that was a little bit lucky. Thank you to your wonderful transcribers. You did a great job, but you know, this is what we’re dealing. We’re dealing with some tough people and evil people. Somebody said president, a friend of mine from New York, very successful guy, big builder said, “President, President.” They don’t call me Donald anymore. I lost all my friends because everybody, they call me up. They say, ” Oh, it’s the president. And it’s the president.” I pick up. “Hey Richard, how you doing, Rich?” He goes, “Mr. President, sir. How are you?” He used to say, “Hey, Don, how about going out to dinner tonight?” It’s true. I lost all my friends because they all respect the office. Forget about, they respect the office of the president. Right? True. And call me up. He’ll say, “Mr. President, sir.” I’ve known this guy for so many years. I don’t say exactly how many, but too many, many. Let’s put it this way. Many more than 30. So I say, “Richard, loosen up, loosen up.” “Yes sir.” I said, “Call me Donald.” “Yes, sir.” Okay. So, we’re going on. And I say, “How’s everything going? How’s New York? I miss it.” “It’s going to hell with this crazy mayor, this crazy governor we have. Crime is through the roof.” Crime in New York is through the roof and it all happened since I left. I mean, maybe I should take credit for that, that we did a good job. No, but it’s very sad what happened. I said, “How’s it going?” We talked. And then he ends it by saying “Mr. President, sir. Thank you very much.” I said, “Richard, you don’t have to thank me for speaking to me.” And it’s one of those things, but they have respect for the office, right? They have respect for the office. And we have to have more respect for our country. When somebody gets up before the halls of Congress, in the halls. So when Schiff gave this phony speech about my conversation, he was quoting my conversation. He didn’t know we had it transcribed. And normally, I wouldn’t do that. We actually called up Ukraine. We said, “Do you mind if we release it?” They said, “No.” They didn’t understand why, but they were nice. You know, they were very nice. I said, “Do you mind?” “No.” We had our secretary of state call actually. Do you mind? Because it would be nice to let them know we’re going to release it, right? Would be very nice. And what happens is it was totally different. And I said, “Oh, we’re going to sue him. And we’re going to do things to him because he lied in the halls of Congress.” And they told me, you know what they told me? No, sir, I’m sorry. He has total immunity. He can say anything he wants in the halls. It’s true. And I thought to myself, “Isn’t that crazy? It should be the exact opposite.” You should be mandated to be more honest in the halls of Congress. Not where you have immunity to say anything you want. Oh, did they die? Did crazy Nancy go crazy when she heard that we had a transcript? She looked at her people and she said, “What the hell is this? This is not impeachable. So far down just go for it anyway. This is … and we … I have to tell you [inaudible 00:26:08] Republicans … We had great … in the house it was 196 or so to nothing. And we got a Democrat and a half. Van Drew, good guy, running for office, going to do very well. Jeff, he’s going to do very well. He came over. He said, “This is so corrupt. I’m going to become a Republican.” And he’s going to do great. But it really is. Think of it. When you’re in the halls of Congress, you should be more honest instead of where you can say anything you want. And that’s probably, maybe we should go for, let’s go for a little change. The radical Biden-Harris agenda is projected to slash the typical American home income by at least $6,500 per year. Think of that. They’ll raise your taxes by four. You know, Biden’s going to raise your taxes. We could go four trillion. Everyone says, “What does that mean?” You know what it means? It means a lot. They’re going to raise your taxes by $4 trillion triggering a mass exodus of jobs out of America and to foreign countries. You know how many jobs I brought in? I brought in jobs that was just stifled because our taxes were so crazy. The Biden tax hikes will wipe out up to another quarter of the small business income and 25% of all US investment. Your stocks, your 401(k)s and pensions will be demolished. You’ll go into a depression the likes of which you haven’t seen since 1929. That’s what’s going to happen. He’s going to raise your taxes. He’s going to put all the regulations back on. I’m sure he’ll join the wonderful Paris accord. How’s it working out for France? I don’t think so, right? No, it takes away our wealth. It was meant to take away our wealth. Somebody will come in someday and they’ll say, “Isn’t that wonderful?” Our air is cleaner than all of them. We just had our best numbers environmentally. The cleanest, the best without spending fortunes. And it’s rigged for China and Russia and India and all these other countries. And it’s really bad for us. And everybody said, you know, when I did that, when I got out of the Paris climate accord, okay? They call it the Paris. Such a beautiful name, right? When I got out, the people understood it immediately. I said, “This is a tough one. I’m going to get killed in this one.” That’s okay, close your eyes, sign it. Boom. But the people got it right away. They’re taking your wealth away. They don’t want oil. They don’t want petroleum. They don’t want, you know why? Because they don’t have it and because we do. We are the number one in the world right now and they want to take it away. Biden’s plan will destroy five million jobs, eliminate $2.6 trillion in wealth and hurt lower and middle income families. The most of all, I will deliver optimism, opportunity and hope. Biden will deliver pessimism, poverty and decline. For the last 47 years, Joe Biden has been outsourcing your job, opening your borders. Oh, by the way, our border is closed. That’s why you never hear about it. Do you ever notice you don’t hear about that? You don’t hear about our vets anymore because we take such good. Remember, every night you’d hear about vet. Before me, 91% approval rating with our vets. Our vets voted 91%. We never had anything like it. And sacrificing American blood and treasure in endless foreign wars, in countries that you’ve never even heard of. And they’re all coming back. You know that, right? I mean, I hope nobody objects. I think 19 years in Afghanistan is enough, wouldn’t you say? We’re like a police force over there. We have the greatest soldiers in the world. But over there, we’re like a police force. 19 years is enough. You think it’s easy getting out with all the military industrial complex, right? Dwight Eisenhower. It’s a military, beware the military industrial complex there. Right? But we’re all coming home. They’re all coming home. In 2016, North Carolina voted to fire this depraved political establishment. And you elected an outsider as president who is finally putting America first. Joe Biden, as you’ve been reading for the last four weeks, although it’s hard to find because they shut it. That you’ve learned how corrupt the press is more than what I’ve been saying for four years. I’ve known it. I’ve said it, but I don’t know how many people believed in. You see how corrupt they are when the New York Times and the Washington Post and all of these other, they don’t even write about a man who is a totally corrupt politician. He’s a corrupt politician. In addition, he led communist shine to plunder your jobs while his family raked in millions from China and foreign nations. Think of it. How about Russia? How about Russia? Three and a half million dollars from the mayor of Moscow’s wife. Three and a half. Oh, I see. What did you do for that? There’s a lot. That’s like one of the smaller hits. He was like a vacuum cleaner. You know, they go into a country. It was like having a vacuum cleaner. Just suck it all in. And if you mention it, if you mention it and I have great respect for the New York Post. The New York Post, fourth largest newspaper, the oldest, but the New York Post, what they’ve done is incredible. But you know the big tech, they put you out. Twitter, they take you out. Charlie Kirk, so many people, they take them out. They take them out. They say, “We’re not going to stand for this.” If you call them corrupt, they’ll say “We’re not going to stand.” Because that’s where they’re coming from. Think of what’s happening. Does everyone know what I’m talking about? Nobody thought it was even possible. And the news pay our dues, you know? All the news that’s fit to print. Actually, it’s all the news that’s not fit to print because they don’t want to print it. They don’t want to put it in. I mean, it is disgraceful. We talk about freedom of the press. This is the exact opposite of freedom of the press. They don’t want to put the word out. And even me, I make a speech like this, they’ll turn off, look, I bet you, the cameras turn off because they don’t want it. Nobody, even me. I’m the big cynic of the world. I never thought this was possible. His so called Biden’s center at the University of Pennsylvania has already received $70 million from China. 70 million. That can’t be possible. Is that possible? Explosive emails from Hunter Biden also show that Hunter was negotiating with a Chinese firm, tied to the communist China party to receive $10 million a year for introductions. Well, that sounds reasonable. I think you’d do that. I think I’d even do 10 million to introduce. “Hey, I’d like to introduce this. Send me the 10 million.” Another email referenced 10% held by Hunter for the big guy. I wonder who the big guy was. The big guy. He doesn’t look so big to me. He doesn’t look so big when he walks on the stage. He’s not looking too the strong. Fragile, very fragile, but the big guy. They call him the big guy. One document shows a plan to take money from Chinese state owned enterprises. I’ll tell you what, this laptop is a disaster. How the hell did he ever let go of this sucker, you know? He put it to a, he got to have it fixed. I guess he forget to pick it up. What that hell? And then Schiff. That’s where he bled. He said it’s Russia did it. It’s Russia. Russia, oh Russia. They probably think we are the wackiest people. They say, “What do we do now?” He created a laptop for Hunter Biden with pictures and all. This is a matter of national security. The Biden’s got rich. Well, North Carolina and our country got robbed, okay? If Biden wins, China will own the United States. They’ll own it. The media and the big tech are desperately trying to cover up this massive scandal. I’m not just running against Sleepy Joe Biden. I’m running against the corrupt media. They’re corrupt, the corrupt media, the big tech giants. And I’m against the Washington swamp. It’s time to send a message to these wealthy liberal hypocrites by delivering Joe Biden a thundering defeat on November 3rd. That’s a lot of people. It’s a big crowd. By the way, this is a big crowd. You should have seen the people in the road. They couldn’t get in. As big as this crowd is tens of thousands of people on the roads coming up, they couldn’t get in. Couldn’t get in. They said, “How big is your arena?” I said, “I don’t know. We have a big field.” “Oh good.” I said, “It’s sold out.” How do you sell out a field, right? They said, “Sir, I’m sorry. We can’t let anyone else in.” The police, they’re great by the way. They are. I said, “Officer, we have 10,000 people out there, much more than that. All the way down.” And he said, “I’m sorry, sir.” I said, “It’s a field. Just let’s open it up. Let’s move the trucks back, the buses, everything.” They said, “Sir, we have a problem.” “What?” “Stampede.” I said, “Stampede.” He said, “We got so many people. Were worried about it.” “I thought that was for cattle. Right?” He said stampede. No, can you imagine? Now, Joe doesn’t have that problem. He has about four or five circles. They can’t fill them up, but I love the people. The only thing I like about him is the person that does the circles after this is all over. No, they do a beautiful job. Nice wide, beautiful, everything. You know, I’m a perfectionist. It’s beautiful those circles. They’re very far away from each other. You couldn’t catch COVID in those circles no matter what you did. So if I don’t sound like a typical Washington politician, it’s because I’m not a politician. Thank you. The only thing we do to make them totally crazy is we say 12 more years because [inaudible 00:37:23]. Right? Then they say, “See, he is a fascist.” Oh, they’ve covered me. They’ve covered me every way. They’ve said he is so stupid. Then they say he’s not really smart. Then they say he’s trying to take over the entire country. Then they say no, no, no, no, no, no. He’s a super genius. He’s more brilliant than every greatest ever. He’s trying to take over the entire world. So, I go from not being smart to being the smartest person in history, but evil. Someday they’re going to say, “You know what? He was a smart guy, ran a great country.” Okay. That’s what we want. It’s this country. It’s this country. You know, they’ve called me everything in the book. They’ve called me names that you wouldn’t believe. And we just keep going along. Right? Because nobody’s been able to do what we’ve done in the first three and a half years. Nobody even close. Nobody. So if I don’t always play by the rules of the Washington establishment, it’s because I was elected to fight for you harder than anybody has ever fought for you before. Nobody’s ever fought for you. You think this is easy? All these women, 61, this is number 61 times. These incredible women right here. They’re rich as hell. I said to him, I said, also in North Carolina, but a long ways away from here, right? It’s a big state, but I saw him two weeks and I said, “How many times have you been here?” They said 60 at the time, because I’ve seen them. I said, “Your husbands have a problem with it. I think your husbands are with you tonight.” Standup husbands, please. Stand up. Look at these guys. Handsome. Very handsome, good looking guys. How about the women standing up? Would you stand up, please? Look at them. Great people. These are great people. These are great Americans. These are really great American people. These are great American people that we love. One of the most important issues in this election is the safety of the American family. The Biden-Harris war on police would be a catastrophe for our nation. Just look at what the left has done in Democrat run Chicago, Portland, New York City, Oakland, name any … Baltimore. Did you hear what happened? You know, Obama’s now campaigning. Even though he refused to support Biden. And then even after Biden sort of semi-won, he semi-won, he wouldn’t do it. It took forever. But now he’s campaigning for him. And somebody said, “Sir, maybe this isn’t good [inaudible 00:00:16], President Obama’s campaigning for sleepy Joe Biden.” And I said, “Huh, that’s good news or bad news. Tell me. Are you saying it’s good or it’s bad?” “Well, I guess it’s bad.” “No, it’s good.” There was nobody that campaigned harder for crooked Hillary Clinton and Obama, right? He was all over the place. He said, “He will not be out President.” But before that, he said, “He will not run.” He didn’t know me. Then I ran. Then he said, “He will not get the nomination.” Then I got the nomination. Then he said, “He will not be our President.” And I won. I think the only one more unhappy than tricking Hillary that night was Barack Hussein Obama. The only one. Barack Hussein Obama. You know, when I say that name, I think of a man who is an incredible man, who’s having difficulty, but there’s nobody more brave. And he would talk a lot about Barack Obama. He would talk about Obama all the time, I wouldn’t say in the most positive way, but with respect. Rush Limbaugh, he’s great. Rush Limbaugh. And you talk about a fighter. He’s fighting. He is a fighter. You never saw a fighter like Rush. And he got our greatest award. He got the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which is the highest, that and the Congressional Medal of Honor. And it was a great evening and he has a fantastic wife and family. But Rush is having a hard time and I will tell you something. He is something special. Try talking for years and years, biggest audience in radio history. Try talking for three hours without phone calls. You know, it’s easy. Pick up a phone. “Hey, how you doing on social security?” He would just talk and talk and talk, biggest audience ever. Sean Hannity thinks one of the greats ever in anything. One of the greats. Mark Levin, Laura, Tucker has been getting better and better all the time. Right? Getting better all the time. The great Lou Dobbs. Right? Great Lou Dobbs. Lou Dobbs has been great. Lou Dobbs has been great. No, we have a lot of great people and we’re getting more and more. It’s very interesting. Getting more. But I just want to pay my absolute respect. He’s in there fighting and I’ll tell you what, nobody can do it like him. Rush Limbaugh. Okay? Biden and Harris’s anti-police rhetoric is inciting riots and putting our police in grave danger. You know, I watched this guy today and he’s talking about how it was so calm. It wasn’t calm. Ferguson, St. Louis, Baltimore, right? Oakland. They had things going on that were worse. I mean, you look at Baltimore. Remember that whole mess? But now it’s like, “Oh, they were so wonderful.” And then you look at the H1N1 that Joe calls the opposite, the Swine Flu. You look at that and you say, “Well, wait a minute. That was handled so badly.” And the person that was running his whole thing said, “This was handled so badly. You have no idea how badly it was run.” And then they criticize us. He says I didn’t close up soon enough. But he was two months late. And he was criticizing me for closing up too soon. So, you know, it always gets me when somebody is in office for 47 years, he could have done a lot. How much? He said, “More.” Barely in office, right? But all you have to do is you have to say, “Well, why didn’t you do it?” I always say that. Why didn’t you do it? Don’t complain. Get it done. We get it done. Nobody has done more in three and a half years. But I will always stand because they don’t. They don’t. They wanted to disassociate themselves. I will always stand with the men and women of law enforcement. Biden is also pledging mass amnesty and free federal healthcare for illegal aliens. And we all have a heart. It will obliterate Medicare and social security with it. But we all have a heart. I want to take care of everybody. The problem is our country will be flooded with tens of millions of people, free healthcare, free education. I always say, for them, it drives them crazy. Everybody gets a free Rolls Royce. And then they say I am misrepresenting. They don’t get a Rolls Royce. But think of it, free healthcare. I will always protect your Medicare and your social security. It will never be protected with them. And I’m also proud that here in North Carolina, your Medicare Advantage premiums have decreased because of us, because of good management, by over 44%. [inaudible 00:45:19] Where’d you hear that? You don’t hear that too often. On healthcare, we’re providing American families with affordable high quality, personalized healthcare. The Washington Democrats want bureaucrats calling the shots, rationing care, and deciding who gets treatment. The battle of the China virus, we launched the largest mobilization since World War II. It’s incredible what we’ve done, and we’ve helped out a lot of governors. We’ve made a lot of really bad governors look good, and we’ve made some good ones look great. And I can tell you, we got some bad ones and we have some really good ones. And I’ll someday tell you it is. Our early and aggressive actions saved more than two million lives. I took rapid action to ban travel from China and Europe. And Biden opposed both. Remember? They’re highly infected. I said, “We got to stop it.” We pioneered incredible therapies. Excuse me, here I am. Her I am. I don’t know what the hell it was. All I know, I know I got it, and I have to. Look, as President, I can’t stay in the basement of the White House. I really can’t. I meet with families, gold star families. I meet with so many people, heads of state. I meet with all these people. Sometimes I’ll leave. And I’ll say, “Man, that’s dangerous.” I start thinking, I say, “You know, I’m meeting with so many people,” but I can’t stay in a basement or I can’t say in a beautiful bedroom in the White House where I say, “Hello world, let me stay here for a year.” I can’t do that with the First Lady. If I have to choose somebody, I’ll choose the First Lady. No, but I can’t… They do love Melania, it’s true. But I can’t just stay inside and do that. And it’s risky. And I caught it. And I didn’t feel too good. And I was surrounded by doctors. I’ve never seen so many doctors in my life. You know, I was always well taken care of, but I’ve never seen, I mean, every doctor from every major place in the world. Johns Hopkins was great. Johns Hopkins was really fantastic. And you know, Walter Reed is unbelievable. But I had 12 doctors standing around my bed and every one of them had a hand on a different part of my body. I didn’t like it, but I didn’t feel good. And they gave me what’s called Regeneron, which is antibodies, very strong antibodies. And there is other Eli Lilly makes something. I mean, it’s incredible. By the way, what they’re doing now is incredible. And I don’t know, maybe it was great. Maybe it would have happened anyway. But I woke up the next morning and I felt like Superman. I felt like Superman. Regeneron. And I’m working to make the same antibody treatment that I received available to anybody that needs it, free. We’re getting it approved. We’re signing what’s called Emergency Use Declaration. We’re getting it because it’s so new. It’s not even really approved. It’s almost like Right to Try. You know, I got Right to Try, right, for people that are sick, and they’d have to travel to other parts of the world, or if they didn’t have money, they’d have to go home and die. Even if we had something that looked good, but it wasn’t approved by the FDA, we cut those times way down anyway. I mean half, we cut them in half. But still, has to be approved. And we got Right to Try done. And that’s where there’s a drug that has potential and somebody’s dying, terminally ill, and they couldn’t do it because they said, “Well, supposing they die. They’re going to die anyway.” But still, not easy because the insurance companies had very deep problems. And the drug companies had problems. They didn’t want them on the list, a lot of different things, and the country had problems because the country doesn’t want to get sued by everybody if it doesn’t work out. And so I have them signed. Now we wrote up a very sophisticated but simple agreement that somebody taking any of the new really incredible medicines, we’re the greatest labs and doctors in the world, anybody taking it will sign away their rights. They’re not going to sue anybody. And you know what’s happened? We have had more success with Right to Try. It’s incredible. It’s incredible. It’s really incredible. It’s a great thing. That’s one of so many things we’ve done. We have done so many things. I could go on all night about the things we’ve done, but you’d start saying, well, you know, he’s done a great job, but let’s get the hell out of here, Harry. And we will have 100 million vaccine doses before the end of this year. Okay? And if you look, cases in Europe are surging. You know, they don’t talk about that. They’re always saying, “Europe, Europe, Europe.” Well, sorry. But they’re surging. I don’t want that to happen. But cases in Europe are surging. Biden’s lockdown would reduce life expectancy. You know, when you do these lockdowns, like you are suffering through in North Carolina, you have a governor, depression, suicide, drugs, alcohol, and many other problems. And your kids want to go to school. They want to go. They have to go to school. So I want to send a message tonight to America’s incredible moms. The moms are heroes. They really are. They’re heroes. They know better than anyone that their children do belong in school. And they want their children to go back to school. I will open your schools. Biden will close your schools, and he’ll keep them closed. I mean, these people, it’s like crazy what’s going on. I don’t get it. Maybe it will be right after the election’s going to end. Hopefully we’re going to win. And then these governors would just say, “Oh.” They’ll go like this, “Oh. Just open the place up.” No, the states closed and so many, but see, they think that’s going to give us worse numbers. So here’s the number you have to watch out. GDP. It’s going to be announced two days before the election, November 3rd. It’s going to be announced like on November 1st, just watch it. I think it’s going to say, I don’t know anything by the way, this is for the media. No, I don’t have any inside information, but the Atlanta Fed came out today and they gave a number that’s one of the most incredible numbers anyone’s ever heard, many times what the all time record would be. They said GDP will increase in this third quarter by 35%, 35%. People were hearing 20. People were hearing 20. But here’s the problem. Now, if it 25 or 30, they’ll say, “Donald Trump failed to meet.” I mean, I think the highest is probably eight, seven, six, eight something, nine. But they said they predicted 35%. So if it was 20%, it would be incredible. That would be double, triple what the highest in history was. But this is a number that because we’re doing great. But the Democrats think by keeping North Carolina closed and Pennsylvania, we love Pennsylvania, closed, and by keeping Michigan closed, this governor that’s always blaming everybody for everything, by keeping, except her husband, by keeping… It’s true. By keeping Michigan closed and all of this that it’ll affect the number. Well, the number is going to be great anyway. And they got to open up California. We got to open up California. I see what’s going on. People are leaving California. They’re leaving New York because they can’t take it. Number one, they have the basic problems, high taxes, crime. But on top of it, they can’t even open. It’s a very sad thing. And they’re killing. I don’t know where they’re coming from. I don’t know what they’re doing, but they have to open these states up. And your governor has to open your state up. And this is brilliant, brilliant timing. Boy, this is great timing because I just see. We’re joined tonight by your Lieutenant Governor, Dan Forest. Dan, you better come up here. Come on. Let’s get this guy. Where is Dan? Come on, Dan. Look at him. He’s a handsome guy. Don’t worry. He’s locked in. Secret service will get. Take your time. We’re also joined by South Carolina, Lieutenant Governor, Pamela Evette. Pamela. Where’s Pamela? Thank you, Pamela. Wow. So young, and so strong, and so smart. Good. You’re doing a fantastic job. Say hello to the Governor. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Pamela. Come up here, Dan. Come up here. Say a few words. Thank you, Dan. Thank you. Thank you, Dan. He’ll be a great Governor. Hey Dan, you’re making a lot of progress. I see the polls are very close, Dan. They’re getting a little bit nervous. They’re getting a little nervous about you. A friend of mine from the beginning, she’s always been with me and just a fantastic woman, Virginia Fox, Congresswoman. Congresswoman. She walks into a room and those Congressmen, they shake and they quick. Right? It’s true. Another friend of mine who we were involved with right at the beginning, he showed incredible courage and stamina. The race was a tough race. He’s got another one coming up now and I hope everybody’s going to be with him. He’s turned out to be a great Congressman, Dan Bishop. Dan. Dan. Dan Bishop. Thank you, Dan. Great job. A lot of courage, And also a warrior, a friend, really helps out whenever we needed, he’s there, Ted Budd, Ted. Great Congressman. Thank you. Thank you, Ted. Thank you, Dan. North Carolina, GOP chair, Michael Whatley. Hi Michael. And we’re doing well? Oh, that’s good. Michael. We’re going to win this state, I would think. I’ll tell you. You know those votes are all sort of coming in and some aren’t coming in like they thought. They’re going a little crazy, Michael. They’re a little bit concerned about what’s happening. Aren’t they? Not only here, a lot of other states, too. Press just refuses to report it, but eventually they have to. Because you know, at some point you win and then they say, “Okay.” Remember last time, right, four years ago? Remember the hand of John King? He was sort of like… I haven’t seen him lately. Did he get fired or something? I think one of their lawyers just got fired. Just got fired for a good reason. Well, he hasn’t been too nice to us. Let’s face it. That was a strange deal going on. No, but remember four years ago, the thing, his hand… Looked very brave. “Oh, this is going to be very over. This is going to be over very quick.” Then about four hours later, the hand started to shake. And then he said, “I can’t believe what’s happening.” But we could believe it. We know it. And we know what’s happening again. We know what’s happening again, except more so. This is now happening again, Michael, except more so. You were there. Is this more than four years ago? Yeah. No, there’s more enthusiasm. There’s more enthusiasm. There’s more support. No, this is even more so, I think, Michael. You better win, Michael. I will fire you so fast. And two friends of mine, I’ll tell you what, these people. My wife called. She said, “I just have to come over.” She was in New York and she came in. She said, “You have to see,” and she brought a clip. She said, “You have to see this. These two people are great. They are great.” This is four years ago. And it was Diamond and Silk. Where are they? Where are they? Are they here? Look at them. Look at them. No, it’s true. First Lady came in. She said, “You got to take a look at this being.” And she pressed. I said, “That’s amazing. They are great.” Thank you very much. Right from the beginning, right? You understood long before a lot of other people. You understood. You got it. They’re also doing really well for themselves and I’m happy. I said, “Go out and do well.” Right? Thank you. Thank you. Great honor. Thank you. Great people. Thanks also to your Senator, Thom Tillis. Thanks also to your Senator, Thom Tillis, whose opponent had an unexpected problem, times two. Thom’s a good guy. Thom has been with us. He’s been working hard. He’s respected very much in Washington. He’s really a good Senator. Really, a good Senator, and he’s been strong. So, I hope he gets in. I hope you guys are going to go out and get him in. He’s terrific, but he really did, he had a little luck, but we wouldn’t call it luck. It’s an unfortunate situation in many ways. So, we’ll see how it all turns out, but it’s a close race. It’s going to be a tough race, but our race doesn’t look like it’s going to be as close. Our race looks like it’s going for the win. With us as well are members of the incredible Lumbee Catawba tribes, Lumbee Catawba, where are they? Oh, look at you guys. Wow. Wow. That’s a good looking group of people. Lumbee Catawba, thank you very much for being here. We appreciate it. We’re working with you and you have a great Congressman in Dan, you know that, right? Right, Dan? I’ll tell you, you’re lucky you have Dan. He’s a big supporter. Thank you very much. Thank you everybody. As you know, the Lumbee Tribe has been fighting for a federal recognition for more than a century. That’s all. Well, you’re moving faster than a lot of people move. That’s a long time. When I am reelected, we’ll work with Congress, and we’ll work with Dan, and we’ll work with all of them on the Lumbee Recognition Act and we’ll get it done. It’s about time. I noticed you do have great support within the State. You have Dan, but you have great support within the State. So, that’s great. We’ll work on that very strongly. Thank you. Thank you. Under my administration, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world, and now we are doing it again. In my first three years, we increased family income over $6,000 and much more when you include energy, because these people want to wipe out your energy, we’re energy independent. They want to wipe it out. Whoever thought you’d be paying $2 to gasoline, sometimes less? That’s like a big tax cut. That’s more than five times the gains in all eight years under the Obama Administration. Think of that. In three years versus eight years, medium income range and reached, wow, $69,000. That’s good. That’s good. That’s an all time. That’s an all time. Income for Black Americans grew nine times. Think of that. It grew nine times more under my leadership thank under Biden and Obama. Grew nine times more, much shorter period of time. African-American unemployment, Hispanic-American unemployment, and Asian-American unemployment all reached their lowest levels in the history of our country. Women’s unemployment reached the lowest rate in more than 70 years. We lifted nearly 7 million Americans out of poverty, including nearly 1.2 million African-Americans, lifted out of poverty. Think of that. Nobody has done this. These are world records. When the virus hit, we experienced the smallest contraction of any major country anywhere in the world. We also are now witnessing by far the fastest recovery. We’re recovering faster than anything. You’ll see what that number is. Let’s see what it is. I don’t know, 35, but it’s going to be a great number. Since April, we created a record 11.4 million jobs. Never done that before. Under Biden, it took 30 months to recover more than half of the jobs lost in the crisis. We did it in five months. Think of that. We’ve spent the last four years reversing the damage Joe Biden inflicted over the last 47 years. He supported NAFTA, the worst trade deal ever made. GPP would have been the worst trade deal ever made, it would have been even worse, but I didn’t let it go through. China’s entry into the world trade organization, one of the worst things ever to happen to this country. He betrayed, quite honestly, the American worker. That’s what he did, and he always has. He always has. Now, he’s saying, “We have to protect America. We have to protect … We have to hire.” He says, we have to hire. He copied me. We have to hire American, he says. I said, “He copied me, get a new phrase.” He’s not doing anything. He didn’t do it for years, and forget the 47, it wasn’t like they were out long, right? He didn’t do any of this stuff when they were there. He also voted for the war in Iraq, terrible decision. For decades, our politicians spent trillions and trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign wars, and defending foreign borders. But now, we are finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities, and we are bringing our jobs, our factories, and our troops back home to the USA where they belong. I’m also taking care of North Carolina tobacco growers, is that okay? Yes? North Carolina tobacco growers. Under my leadership we achieved the most secure border in US history by far. My opponent’s insane immigration plan would be a nightmare for North Carolina families. He would eliminate US borders by implementing nationwide catch and release. We ended catch and release. That’s when you catch somebody, it could be a murderer, it could be a rapist, it could be a criminal of some kind, and you let them free and say, “Excuse me, come back in for years, we’re going to give you a trial.” Nobody ever comes back. Who would come back? Only a very stupid person would come back. So, it’s catch and release, I ended that. You think that was easy to end that? It was not easy. It was not easy. It sounds easy, but it wasn’t. It’s ended. He wants to make every community into a sanctuary city for violent criminals. No, thank you. The Biden-Harris plan, and you’ve had a lot of problems with your sanctuary cities. You’ve had a lot of crime because of your, and a lot of death, with your sanctuary cities and city. The Biden-Harris plan would also increase refugees 700% from the most dangerous places in the world. That was done with crazy Bernie, right? That was the manifesto. I call it the manifesto. They agreed to the 700% increase. They pledged to terminate all national security travel bands, which I got. I got a travel ban. Remember they said, “You’d never get it approved.” I got it approved. Now, if somebody hates us, if they hate us from a different part of the world, we say, “I’m sorry. You cannot come in.” That makes sense, doesn’t it? They’ll open the flood gates to radical Islamic terrorism. The beheading that took place in France just a few days ago is a horrifying reminder that we have to be vigilant. I sent our regards and our sympathies to France and to their president, Macron who’s a terrific guy, he’s working very hard. I’m keeping the terrorists, jihadists, and violent extremists the hell out of our country, if that’s okay with you. I will never say it because it’s not good to say it, and I’m knocking on a nice, beautiful wood because I can tell it’s ours because they spend a lot of money on building these things. But you haven’t seen too much happening on that front, have you, huh? You noticed. Okay, well, keep your eyes, hey, keep your eyes open. Keep your eyes open, because I’d love to do something. Just keep your eyes open. But there’s a reason for things not happening also. We invested $2.5 trillion in the US military. As you all know, defense spending in North Carolina has soared, made in the USA, all made in the USA. For our great veterans, we passed VA Choice and VA Accountability. Nobody thought that was ever going to happen. We killed the leader of ISIS al-Baghdadi and we took out the mass murder of American troops. Soleimani is dead. I withdrew from the last administration’s disastrous Iran nuclear deal. How about this, $150 billion for nothing. Don’t forget, 1.8 billion in cash, many airplanes loaded up with cash. I recognize the true capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. I also recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, 52 years they worked on that, we got it done in two hours, 52 years. Instead of never ending wars, we are forging peace in the Middle East without blood all over the sand. I just signed up another country today. Iran doesn’t want to let me win. China doesn’t want to let me win. They want me to be defeated so badly. The swamp doesn’t want to let me win because I am fighting for you. I’m fighting for you. The first call I’ll get after we win, the first call I’ll get will be from Iran saying, “Let’s make a deal.” Because if you talk about an economy, their economy GDP down 27%. Nobody has ever even heard of it. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans. So, in conclusion, we’re all about the American dream. We’re about the American dream. Abraham Lincoln was a Republican. We have to say that. Honestly, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. We will end our reliance on China once and for all. It’s already happening. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement. We will ban deadly sanctuary cities. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms, Second Amendment. Remember, Joe Biden is going to take away your Second Amendment. He’s going to take it away. Don’t even think about it. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our cities and we will keep America out of these ridiculous, absolutely crazy foreign wars. We will do it. Countries you’ve never even heard of. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. That’s what we have right now. The equipment that we built is the greatest anywhere in the world, Russia, China, North Korea, everybody, we are the envy. Nobody has equipment like us. Missiles, rockets, tanks, submarines, ships, fighter jets, beautiful, beautiful, the best stuff anywhere in the world, hydrosonic missiles, seven times faster than anything else, seven times. They go rather quickly, and we’ve totally redone our nuclear and hope to God, all of it, hope to God we never have to use any of it, that’s all. But because it’s now redone, remember I got here and a highly overrated general said, “Sir, we have no ammunition.” I said, “That should never happen to a President again.” But hope to God this equipment never has to be used, but nobody has it like us. The reason it may never be used is because we have it. If we didn’t have it, we may have very big problems. We could have had very big problems. We got it done, made in the USA. We will end the surprise medical billing, require price transparency already done, already signed, kicks in on January 1st. That’s a big thing. That’s going to be bigger. Please remember, price transparency bigger than healthcare. Why do you say this? A lot of people aren’t too happy with what I did there further reduced the cost of prescription drugs, favored nations. We’re going to get the lowest in the world, and we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions, always. America will land the first woman in the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. We will live by the timeless words of our national motto, “In God we trust.” For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now, you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of North Carolina, standing up for North Carolina. But we have the most important election in our history. So, get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your co-workers, get your boss, rip them out of the seat and get out and vote. You got to get out and vote. From Asheville, we’ll be there soon, to Charlotte, from Wilmington to Raleigh, and from Greensboro to right here in Gastonia. We stand on the shoulders of red blooded American patriots who poured out their heart, sweat, and soul to secure our liberty and defend our freedom. Our brave American ancestors crossed the oceans, blazed the trail, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, raised up the great skyscrapers, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world, and you haven’t seen anything yet. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. That’s what happened four years ago. With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. Together with the incredible people of North Carolina, we have made America powerful again, our military. We have made America wealthy again, our stock market, your 401ks, your 401ks are booming. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again. We have made America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, North Carolina. Go out and vote. Thank you. Go out and vote. Thank you very much.

"93","10-22-20","How are you doing? How are you? So as you know, 2.2 million people modeled out, were expected to die. We closed up the greatest economy in the world in order to fight this horrible disease that came from China. It’s a worldwide pandemic. It’s all over the world. You see the spikes in Europe and many other places right now. If you notice, the mortality rate is down 85%. The excess mortality rate is way down and much lower than almost any other country. And we’re fighting it and we’re fighting it hard. There is a spike. There was a spike in Florida and it’s now gone. There was a very big spike in Texas. It’s now gone. There was a very big spike in Arizona. It’s now gone. And there was some spikes and surges and other places, they will soon be gone. We have a vaccine that’s coming. It’s ready. It’s going to be announced within weeks. And it’s going to be delivered. We have Operation Warp Speed, which is the military is going to distribute the vaccine. I can tell you from personal experience, I was in the hospital. I had it and I got better. And I will tell you that I had something that they gave me, a therapeutic, I guess they would call it. Some people could say it was a cure, but I was in for a short period of time. And I got better very fast or I wouldn’t be here tonight. And now they say I’m immune. Whether it’s four months or a lifetime, nobody’s been able to say that, but I’m immune. More and more people are getting better. We have a problem that’s a worldwide problem. This is a worldwide problem, but I’ve been congratulated by the heads of many countries on what we’ve been able to do. If you take a look at what we’ve done in terms of goggles and masks and gowns and everything else, and in particular ventilators we’re now making ventilators all over the world, thousands and thousands a month distributing them all over the world. It will go away. And as I say, we’re rounding the turn. We’re rounding the corner. It’s going away. No, it’s not a guarantee, but it will be by the end of the year. But I think it has a good chance. There are two companies, I think within a matter of weeks and it will be distributed very quickly. Johnson & Johnson is doing very well. Moderna is doing very well. Pfizer is doing very well and we have numerous others. Then we also have others that we’re working on very closely with other countries, in particular Europe. No, I think my timeline is going to be more accurate. I don’t know that they’re counting on the military the way I do, but we have our generals lined up, one in particular that’s the head of logistics and this is a very easy distribution for him. He’s ready to go. As soon as we have the vaccine and we expect to have a 100 million vials. As soon as we have the vaccine, he’s ready to go. I don’t think we’re going to have a dark winter at all. We’re opening up our country. We’ve learned and studied and understand the disease, which we didn’t at the beginning. When I closed and banned China from coming in heavily infected and then ultimately Europe, but China was in January. Months later, he was saying I was xenophobic. I did it too soon. Now he’s saying, “Oh, I should have moved quicker,” but he didn’t move quicker. He was months behind me, many months behind me. And frankly, he ran the H1N1 swine flu and it was a total disaster. Far less lethal, but it was a total disaster. Had that had this kind of numbers, 700,000 people would be dead right now, but it was a far less lethal disease. Look, his own person who ran that for him, who, as you know, was his chief of staff said, “It was catastrophic. It was horrible. We didn’t know what we were doing.” Now he comes up and he tells us how to do this. Also, everything that he said about the way every single move that he said we should make, that’s what we’ve done. We’ve done all of it. But he was way behind us. I didn’t say over soon. I say we’re learning to live with it. We have no choice. We can’t lock ourselves up in a basement like Joe does. He has the ability to lock himself up. I don’t know. He’s obviously made a lot of money someplace, but he has this thing about living in a basement. People can’t do that. By the way I as the president couldn’t do that. I’d love to put myself in the basement or in a beautiful room in the White House and go away for a year and a half until it disappears. I can’t do that. And Kirsten, every meeting I had, every meeting I had and I’d meet a lot of families, including gold star families and military families. Every meeting I had and I had to meet them, I had to. It would be horrible to have canceled everything. I said, “This is dangerous and you catch it.” And I caught it. I learned a lot. I learned a lot. Great doctors, great hospitals. And now I recovered. 99.9 of young people recover. 99% of people recover. We have to recover. We can’t close up our nation. We have to open our school and we can’t close up our nation, or you’re not going to have a nation. Excuse me. I take full responsibility. It’s not my fault that it came here. It’s China’s fault. And you know what? It’s not Joe’s fault that it came here either. It’s China’s fault. They kept it from going into the rest of China for the most part, but they didn’t keep it from coming out to the world, including Europe and ourselves. Look, perhaps just to finish this, I was kidding on that, but just to finish this, when I closed he said I shouldn’t have closed. And that went on for months. Nancy Pelosi said the same thing. She was dancing on the streets in Chinatown, in San Francisco. But when I closed, he said, “This is a terrible thing, you xenophobic.” I think he called me racist even, because I was closing it to China. Now he says I should have closed it earlier. Joe, it doesn’t. You certainly did. You certainly did. He thought I shouldn’t have closed the border, that’s obvious. I think we have to respond, if I might. Thank you, and I appreciate that. Look, all he does is talk about shut downs. But forget about him. His Democrat Governors, Cuomo in New York, you look at what’s going on in California, you look at Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Democrats, Democrats all, they’re shut down so tight and they’re dying. They’re dying. And he supports all these people. All he talks about is shut downs. No, we’re not going to shut down. And we have to open our schools. And it’s like, as an example, I have a young son, he also tested positive. By the time I spoke to the doctor the second time, he was fine. It just went away. Young people, I guess, it’s their immune system. I want to open the schools. The transmittal rate to the teachers is very small. But I want to open the schools. We have to open our country. We’re not going to have a country. You can’t do this. We can’t keep this country closed. This is a massive country with a massive economy. People are losing their jobs. They’re committing suicide. There’s depression, alcohol, drugs at a level that nobody’s ever seen before. There’s abuse, tremendous abuse. We have to open our country. I’ve said it often, the cure cannot be worse than the problem itself, and that’s what’s happening. And he wants to close down. He’ll close down the country if one person in our massive bureaucracy says we should close it down. By the way, I will say this, If you go and look at what’s happened to New York, it’s a ghost town. It’s a ghost town. And when you talk about plexiglass, these are restaurants that had dying. These are businesses with no money. Putting up plexiglass is unbelievably expensive, and it’s not the answer. I mean, you’re going to sit there in a cubicle wrapped around with plastic. These are businesses that are dying, Joe. You can’t do that to people. You just can’t. Take a look at New York and what’s happened to my wonderful city. For so many years, I loved it. It was vibrant. It’s dying. Everyone’s leaving New York. Kristen, New York has lost more than 40,000 people, 11,000 people in nursing homes. When you say spike, take a look at what’s happening in Pennsylvania where they’ve had it closed. Take a look at what’s happening with your friend in Michigan, where her husband’s the only one allowed to do anything. It’s been like a prison. Now, it was just ruled unconstitutional. Take a look at North Carolina, they’re having spikes and they’ve been closed, and they’re getting killed financially. We can’t let that happen, Joe. You can’t let that happen. We have to open up. And we understand the disease. We have to protect our seniors. We have to protect our elderly. We have to protect especially our seniors with heart problems and diabetes problems. And we will protect. We have the best testing in the world by far. That’s why we have so many cases. I’m listening to all of them, including Anthony. I get along very well with Anthony, but he did say, “Don’t wear masks.” He did say, as you know, “This is not going to be a problem.” I think he’s a Democrat, but that’s okay. He said, “This is not going to be a problem. We are not going to have a problem at all.” When Joe says that I said, Anthony Fauci said, and others, and many others. And I’m not knocking him, nobody knew. Look, nobody knew what this thing was. Nobody knew where it was coming from, what it was. We’ve learned a lot. But Anthony said “Don’t wear masks,” now he wants to wear masks. Anthony also said, if you look back, exact words, here’s his exact words. “This is no problem. This is going to go away soon.” So he’s allowed to make mistakes. He happens to be a good person. Well, this is what I-I don’t know. Somebody went through Wall Street. You’re the one that takes all the money from Wall Street. I don’t take it. Joe, you have raised a lot of money, tremendous amounts of money. And every time you raise money deals are made, Joe. I could raise so much more money. As President, and as somebody that knows most of those people, I could call the heads of Wall Street, the heads of every company in America. I would blow away every record. But I don’t want to do that because it puts me in a bad position. And then you bring up Wall Street? You shouldn’t be bringing up Wall Street, because you’re the one that takes the money from Wall Street, not me. I could blow away your records like you wouldn’t believe. We don’t need money. We have plenty of money. In fact, we beat Hillary Clinton with a tiny fraction of the money that she was able to-Don’t tell me about-Well, let me respond to the first part, as Joe answered. Joe got $3.5 million from Russia and it came through Putin, because he was very friendly with the former mayor of Moscow and it was the mayor of Moscow’s wife. And you got $3.5 million. Your family got $3.5 million. And someday you’re going to have to explain, why did you get three and a half? I never got any money from Russia. I don’t get money from Russia. Now, about your thing last night. I knew all about that. And through John — who is John Ratcliffe, who is fantastic, DNI — he said the one thing that’s common to both of them. They both want you to lose because there has been nobody tougher to Russia between the sanctions, nobody tougher than me on Russia, between the sanctions, between all of what I’ve done with NATO. I’ve got the NATO countries to put up an extra $130 billion going to $420 billion a year. That’s to guard against Russia. I sold, while he was selling pillows and sheets, I sold tank busters to Ukraine. There has been nobody tougher on Russia than Donald Trump. And I’ll tell you, they were so bad. They took over the submarine port, you remember that very well, during your term, during you and Barack Obama. They took over a big part of what should have been Ukraine. You handed it to them. But you were getting a lot of money from Russia. They were paying you a lot of money, and they probably still are. But now, with what came out today, it’s even worse. All of the emails, the emails, the horrible emails of the kind of money that you were raking in, you and your family. And Joe, you were vice-president when some of this was happening, and it should have never happened. And I think you owe an explanation to the American people. Why is it, somebody just had a news conference a little while ago who was essentially supposed to work with you and your family, but what he said was damning. And regardless of me, I think you have to clean it up and talk to the American people. Maybe you can do it right now. First of all, I called my accountants, underwrote it, I’m going to release them as soon as we can. I want to do it. And it’ll show how successful, how great this company is. But much more importantly than that, people were saying $750. I asked them a week ago, I said, “What did I pay?” They said, “Sir, you prepaid tens of millions of dollars.” I prepaid my tax, over the last number of years, tens of millions of dollars, I prepaid, because at some point, they think it’s an estimate. They think I may have to pay tax. So I already prepaid it. Nobody told me that. Nobody told you that. Excuse me. And it wasn’t written. Whenever they write this, they keep talking about $750, which I think is a filing fee, but let me just tell you, I prepaid millions and millions of dollars in taxes, number one. Number two, I don’t make money from China. You do. I don’t make money from Ukraine. You do. I don’t make money from Russia. You made $3.5 million, Joe, and your son gave you, they even have a statement that we have to give 10% to the big man. You’re the big man, I think. I don’t know, maybe you’re not, but you’re the big man, I think. Your son said we have to give 10% to the big men. Joe, what’s that all about? It’s terrible. As soon as the auditors finish. I get treated worse than the tea party got treated, because I have a lot of people in there deep down in the IRS, they treat me horribly. We made a deal, it was all settled until I decide to run for president. I get treated very badly by the IRS, very unfairly, but we had a deal all done. As soon as we’re completed with the deal, I want to release it, but I have paid millions and millions of dollars and it’s worse than paying. I paid in advance. It’s called prepaying your taxes. I paid-Everybody knows. So...I was put through a phony witch hunt for three years. It started before I even got elected. They spied of my campaign. No president should ever have to go through what I went through. Let me just say this, Mueller and 18 angry Democrats and FBI agents all over the place spent $48 million. They went through everything I had, including my tax returns, and they found absolutely no collusion and nothing wrong. $48 million. I guarantee you, if I spent $1 million on you, Joe, I could find plenty wrong because the kind of things that you’ve done and the kind of monies that your family has taken, I mean, your brother made money in Iraq, millions of dollars. Your other brother made a fortune, and it’s all through you, Joe. And they say you get some of it. And you do live very well, you have houses all over the place. You live very well. But could I just one thing? His son didn’t have a job for a long time, was, sadly, no longer in the military service, I won’t get into that, and he didn’t have a job. As soon as he became vice-president, Burisma, not the best reputation in the world, I hear they paid him $183,000 a month, listen to this, $183,000, and they gave him a $3 million upfront payment, and he had no energy experience. That’s 100% dishonest. I have many bank accounts and they’re all listed and they’re all over the place. I mean, I was a businessman doing business. The bank account you’re referring to, which is, everybody knows about it, it’s listed, the bank account was in 2013. That’s what it was. It was opened. It was closed in 2015, I believe. And then I decided, because I was going to do… I was thinking about doing a deal in China, like millions of other people, I was thinking about it and I decided I’m not going to do it, didn’t like it, I decided not to do it, had an account open and I closed it. Excuse me. And then, unlike him where he’s vice-president and he does business, I then decided to run for president after that. That was before. So I closed it before I even ran for president, let alone became president, big difference. He is the vice-president of the United States and his son, his brother, and his other brother are getting rich. They’re like a vacuum cleaner. They’re sucking up money. No, no, no. Excuse me. No, I have to-Excuse me. No, I have to respond to that. His son walked out with a billion and a half dollars from China to after spending 10 minutes in office and being in Air Force Two. Number one. Number two, there’s a very strong email talking about your family wanting to make $10 million a year for introductions. No, but wait a minute. First of all, China is paying. They’re paying billions and billions of dollars. I just gave $28 billion. I just gave $28 billion to our farmers. It's what? No, no. You know who the taxpayer is? It’s called China. China pays 28 billion, and you know what they did to pay it, Joe? They devalued their currency and they also paid up, and you know got the money? Our farmers, our great farmers, because they were targeted. You never charged them anything. Also, I charged them 25% on dumped steel, because they were killing our steel industry. We were not going to have a steel industry. And now we have a steel industry. That is a typical statement. Excuse me. Just for one second, please. That’s a typical political statement. Let’s get off this China thing, and then he looks, “The family around the table, everything.” Just a typical politician when I see that. I’m not a typical politician. That’s why I got elected. Let’s get off the subject of China. Let’s talk about sitting around the table. Come on, Joe. You could do better. No. So when I met with Barack Obama, we sat in the White House, right at the beginning, had a great conversation. Was supposed to be 15 minutes and it was well over an hour. He said, “The biggest problem we have is North Korea.” He indicated we will be in a war with North Korea. Guess what? It would be a nuclear war. And he does have plenty of nuclear capability. In the meantime, I have a very good relationship with him. Different kind of a guy, but he probably thinks the same thing about me. We have a different kind of a relationship. We have a very good relationship and there’s no war. And about two months ago, he broke into a certain area. They said, “Oh, there’s going to be trouble.” I said, “No, they’re not, because he’s not going to do that.” And I was right. Look, instead of being in a war where millions of people, Seoul is 25 miles away, millions and millions, 32 million people. Millions of people would be dead right now. We don’t have a war and I have a good relationship. Kristen. They tried to meet with him. He wouldn’t do it. He didn’t like Obama. He didn’t like him. He wouldn’t do it. I know for a fact. They tried. We wouldn’t do it. And that’s okay. You know what? North Korea, we’re not in a war. We have a good relationship. People don’t understand. Having a good relationship with leaders of other countries is a good thing. And it didn't happen. Excuse me. He left me a mess. Kristen. They left me a mess. North Korea was a mess, and in fact, if you remember the first two or three months. It was a very dangerous period in my first three months before we worked things out a little bit. There was a very day. They left us a mess, and Obama would be, I think, the first to say it, was the single biggest problem he thought that our country. First of all, I’ve already done something that nobody thought was possible. Through the legislature, I terminated the individual mandate. That is the worst part of Obamacare, as we call it. The individual mandate where you have to pay a fortune for the privilege of not having to pay for bad health insurance, I terminated. It’s gone. Now, it’s in court, because Obamacare is no good. But then I made a decision, run it as well as you can, to my people, great people, run it as well as you can. I could have gone the other route and made everybody very unhappy. They ran it. Premiums are down. Everything’s down. Here’s the problem. No matter how well you run it, it’s no good. What we’d like to do is terminate it. We have the individual mandate done. I don’t know that it’s going to work. If we don’t win, we will have to run it and we’ll have Obamacare, but it’ll be better run. But it no longer is Obamacare, because without the individual mandate, it’s much different. Pre-existing conditions will always stay. What I would like to do is a much better healthcare, much better. We’ll always protect people with pre-existing. So I’d like to terminate Obamacare, come up with a brand new, beautiful healthcare. The Democrats will do it, because there’ll be tremendous pressure on them. And we might even have the House by that time. And I think we’re going to win the House. You’ll see, but I think we’re going to win the House. But come up with a better healthcare, always protecting people with pre-existing conditions. And one thing very important, we have 180 million people out there that have great private healthcare. Far more than we’re talking about with Obamacare. Joe Biden is going to terminate all of those policies. These are people that love their healthcare. People that have been successful, middle-income people, been successful. They have 180 million plans, 180 million people, families. Under what he wants to do, which will basically be socialized medicine, he won’t even have a choice, they want to terminate 180 million plans. We have done an incredible job at healthcare, and we’re going to do even better. Just you watch. Excuse me. He was there for 47 years. He didn’t do it. He was now there as vice president for eight years. And it’s not like it was 25 years ago. It was three and three quarters… It was just a little while ago, right? Less than four years ago. He didn’t do anything. He didn’t do it. He wants socialized medicine. And it’s not that he wants it. His vice president, she is more liberal than Bernie Sanders and wants it even more. Bernie Sanders wants it. The Democrats want it. You’re going to have socialized medicine, just like you want it with fracking. “We’re not going to have fracking. We’re going to stop fracking. We’re going to stop fracking.” Then he goes to Pennsylvania after he gets a nomination, where he got very lucky to get it. And he goes to Pennsylvania, and he says, “Oh, we’re going to have fracking.” And you never ask that question. And by the way, so far, I respect very much the way you’re handling this, I have to say. But somebody should ask the question. He goes for a year, there will be no fracking. There will be no petroleum-No, no. But that’s a big question. It’s the same thing with socialized medicine. Kristen, when he says-When he says public option, he’s talking about socialized medicine and healthcare. When he talks about a public option, he’s talking about destroying your Medicare, totally destroying and destroying your Social Security. And this whole country will come down. Bernie Sanders tried it in his state. He tried it in his state. His governor was a very liberal governor. They wanted to make it work. It was impossible to work. It doesn't work. He tried to get rid of-He tried to hurt Social Security years ago. Years ago. Go back and look at the records. He tried to hurt Social Security years ago. One thing. But this is the guy that when they announced last week-They say the stock market will boom if I’m elected. If he’s elected, the stock market will crash. The biggest analysts are saying that. 401(k)s. Kristen, 401(k)s are through the roof. People's stock are through the roof. And he doesn’t come from Scranton. He lived there for a short period of time before he even knew it. And he left. And the people of Pennsylvania will show you that. They understand. Because Nancy Pelosi doesn't want to approve it. I do. I do. But I still have to get, unfortunately… That’s one of the reasons I think we’re going to take over the House, because of her. Nancy Pelosi doesn’t want to approve anything because she’d love to have some victories on a date called November 3rd. Nancy Pelosi does not want to approve it. We are ready, willing, and able to do something. Don’t forget, we’ve already approved three plans. And it’s gone through, including the Democrats, in all fairness. This one, she doesn’t want. It’s near the election. Because she thinks it helps her politically. I think it hurts her politically. If we made a deal, the Republicans will pass it. The bill that was passed in the House was a bailout of badly run, high crime, Democrat, all run by Democrat cities and states. It was a way of getting a lot of money, billions and billions of dollars, to these guys. It was also a way of getting a lot of money from our people’s pockets to people that come into our country illegally. We were going to take care of everything for them. And I’d love to do that. I’d love to help them. But what that does, everybody all over the world will start pouring into our country. We can’t do it. This was a way of taking care of them. This was a way of spending on things that had nothing to do with COVID, as per your question. But it was really a big bailout for badly run Democrat cities and states. Excuse me. One thing very quickly. He said we have to help our small businesses by raising the minimum wage. That’s not helping. I think it should be a state option. Alabama is different than New York. New York is different from Vermont. Every state is different. It should be a state option. It's very important. We have to help our small businesses. How are you helping your small businesses when you’re forcing wages? What’s going to happen, and what’s been proven to happen, is when you do that, these small businesses fire many of their employees. Say it. Say it. What I really like, and I would consider it to an extent-But what I really like… In a second administration. But not to a level that’s going to put all these businesses out of business. It should be a state option. Look, I’ve lived in different places. I know different places. They’re all different. Some places, $ 15 is not so bad. In other places, other states, $15 would be ruinings. Children are brought here by coyotes and lots of bad people, cartels, and they’re brought here and they used to use them to get into our country. We now have as strong a border as we’ve ever had. We’re over 400 miles of brand new wall. You see the numbers. And we let people in, but they have to come in legally and they come in through-But let me just tell you. Let me just tell you. They built cages. They used to say I built the cages, and then they had a picture in a certain newspaper, and it was the picture of these horrible cages and they said, “Look at these cages. President Trump built them.” And then it was determined they were built in 2014. That was him. They built cages. Yes. We’re working on it very… We’re trying very hard. But a lot of these kids come out without the parents. They come over through cartels and through coyotes and through gangs. Kristen, they did it. We changed the policy. They did it. We changed. They built the cages. Who built the cages, Joe? Who built the cages, Joe? Kristen, I will say this. They went down. We brought reporters, everything. They are so well taken care of. They’re in facilities that were so clean. They have gotten such good… But just ask one question. Who built the cages? I’d love you to ask him that. Who built the cages, Joe? Kristen, he had eight years to do what he said he was going to do. And I’ve changed. Without having a specific, we got rid of catch and release. We got rid of a lot of horrible things that they put in and that they lived with. But he had eight years he was Vice President. He did nothing except build cages to keep children in. So important. It just shows that he has no understanding of immigration, of the laws. Catch and release is a disaster. A murderer would come in. A rapist would come in. A very bad person would come in. We would take their name. We have to release them into our country. And then you say they come back. Less than 1% of the people come back. We have to send ICE out and Border Patrol out to find them. We would say, “Come back in two years, three years. We’re going to give you a court case. You did Perry Mason. We’re going to give you a court case.” When you say they come back, they don’t come back, Joe. They never come back. Only the really… I hate to say this, but those with the lowest IQ, they might come back, but there are very, very few. You don't know the law, Joe. Well, check it out. They don't come back. But we don’t have to worry about it, because they terminated it. So we don’t have to worry about it anymore, Joe. Go ahead. Yes, I do. And again, he’s been in government 47 years, he never did a thing, except in 1994, when he did such harm to the black community, and they were called … and he called them superpredators. And he said that, he said it, superpredators. And they never lived that down. 1994, your crime bill, the superpredators. Nobody has done more for the black community than Donald Trump. And if you look, with the exception of Abraham Lincoln, possible exception, but the exception of Abraham Lincoln, nobody has done what I’ve done. Criminal justice reform, Obama and Joe didn’t do it. I don’t even think they tried because they had no chance at doing it. They might’ve wanted to do it. But if you had to see the arms I had to twist to get that done, it was not a pretty picture. And everybody knows it, including some very liberal people that cried in my office. They cried in the Oval Office. Two weeks later, they’re out saying, “Gee, we have to defeat him.” Criminal justice reform, prison reform, Opportunity Zones with Tim Scott, a great Senator from South Carolina. He came in with this incredible idea for Opportunity Zones. It’s one of the most successful programs. People don’t talk about it. Tremendous investment is being made, biggest beneficiary, the black and Hispanic communities. And then Historically Black Colleges and Universities, after three years of coming to the office, I love some of those guys, they were great. They came into the office and I said, “What are you doing?” After three years, I said, “Why do you keep coming back?” Because we have no funding.” I said, “You don’t have to come back every year.” “We have to come back.” Because President Obama would never give them long-term funding and I did. 10 year long-term funding and I gave them more money than they asked for because I said, “I think you need more.” And I said, “The only bad part about this is I may never see you again.” Because I got very friendly with them and they like me and I like them. But I saved Historically Black Colleges and Universities. But why didn’t he do it four years ago? Why didn’t you do that four years ago? Even less than that. Why didn’t you when you vice president? You keep talking about all these things you’re going to do, and you’re going to do this, but you were there just a short time ago and you guys did nothing. You know Joe, I ran because of you. I ran because of Barack Obama, because you did a poor job. If I thought you did a good job, I would’ve never run. I would’ve never run. I ran because of you. I’m looking at you now, you’re a politician, I ran because of you. Excuse me-If this stuff is true about Russia, Ukraine, China, other countries, Iraq. If this is true, then he’s a corrupt politician. So don’t give me the stuff about how you’re this innocent baby. Joe, that calling you a corrupt politician-They're calling it the laptop from hell. Excuse me, the laptop from hell. You mean the laptop is now another Russia, Russia, Russia hoax? You got to be kidding me-This is where he’s going. The laptop is Russia, Russia, Russia? You have to be kidding, here we go again with the Russia. Boy, oh, boy. Can't believe that one. Well, you have to understand the first time I ever heard of Black Lives Matter, they were chanting, “Pigs in a blanket,” talking about police, pigs, pigs, talking about our police. “Pigs in a blanket, fry them like bacon.” I said, “That’s a horrible thing.” And they were marching down the street. And that was my first glimpse of Black Lives Matter, I thought it was a terrible thing. As far as my relationships with all people, I think I have great relationships with all people. I am the least racist person in this room. I don’t know. I mean, I don’t know what to say. I got criminal justice reform done and prison reform and Opportunity Zones, I took care of Black colleges and universities, I don’t know what to say, they can say anything, I mean, they can say anything. It’s a very… Makes me sad, because I am the least racist person, I can’t even see the audience because it’s so dark, but I don’t care who’s in the audience, I’m the least racist person in this room. No, he made a reference to Abraham Lincoln, where did that come in? I mean-where did that-No. I said, “Not since Abraham Lincoln has anybody done what I’ve done for the Black community.” I didn’t say, “I’m Abraham Lincoln,” I said, “Not since Abraham Lincoln has anybody done what I’ve done for the Black community.” Now, you have done nothing other than the Crime Bill, which put tens of thousands of Black men, mostly, in jail. And you know what? They remember it because if you look at what’s happening with the voting right now, they remember that you treated them very, very badly, just take a look at what’s happening out there. But, why didn’t he get it done? See, it’s all talk, no action with these politicians, why didn’t he get it? “That’s what I’m going to do when I become president.” You were vice president along with Obama as your president, your leader, for eight years, why didn’t you get it done? You had eight years to get it done, now you’re saying you’re going to get it done because you’re all talking and no action, Joe. You didn't get anything done. You got nothing done. I just have one question, why didn’t you do it in the eight years, a short time ago? Why didn’t you do it? You just said, “I’m going to do that, I’m going to do this.” You put tens of thousands of mostly Black young men in prison, now you’re saying you’re going to get… You’re going to undo that, why didn’t you get it done? You had eight years with Obama. You know why, Joe? Because you’re all talk and no action. Well, you got to talk them into it, Joe, sometimes you got to talk them into it. Like I did with criminal justice reform, I had to talk Democrats into it. So, we have the trillion trees program, we have so many different programs, I do love the environment, but what I want is that cleanest crystal clear water, the cleanest air. We have the best lowest number in carbon emissions, which is a big standard that I noticed Obama goes with all the time, not Joe, I haven’t heard Joe use the term because I’m not sure he knows what it represents or means, but I have heard Obama use it. And we have the best carbon emission numbers that we’ve had in 35 years under this administration, we are working so well with industry, but here’s what we can’t do. Look at China, how filthy it is, look at Russia, look at India, it’s filthy, the air is filthy. The [Paris Accord 00:00:13:55], I took us out because we were going to have to spend trillions of dollars and we were treated very unfairly. When they put us in there, they did us a great disservice, they were going to take away our businesses. I will not sacrifice tens of millions of jobs, thousands and thousands of companies because of the Paris Accord, it was so unfair. China doesn’t kick in until 2030, Russia goes back to a low standard, and we kicked in right away, it would have been… It would have destroyed our businesses. So, you ready? We have done an incredible job environmentally, we have the cleanest air, the cleanest water, and the best carbon emission standards that we’ve seen in many, many years. And we haven't destroyed our industries. They came out and said very strongly $6,500 will be taken away from families under his plan, that his plan is an economic disaster. If you look at what he wants to do, if you look at his plan, his environmental plan, do you know developed it? AOC plus three, they know nothing about the climate. I mean, she’s got a good line of stuff, but she knows nothing about the climate and they’re all hopping through hoops for AOC plus three. Look, their real plan cost a hundred trillion dollars. If we had the best year in the history of our country for a hundred years, we would not even come close to a number like that. When he says buildings, they want to take buildings down because they want to make bigger windows into smaller windows. As far as they’re concerned, if you had no window, it would be a lovely thing. This is the craziest plan that anybody has ever seen and this wasn’t done by smart people. This wasn’t done by anybody. Frankly, I don’t even know how it can be good politically. They want to spend a hundred trillion dollars. That’s their real number. He’s trying to say it was six. It’s a hundred trillion dollars. They want to knock down buildings and build new buildings with little, tiny, small windows and many other things and many other things. And many other things. It is crazy. You'll destroy our country. Excuse me. We are energy independent for first time. We don’t need all of these countries that we had to fight war over because we needed their energy. We are energy independent. I know more about wind than you do. It’s extremely expensive. Kills all the birds. It’s very intermittent. It’s got a lot of problems and they happen to make the windmills in both Germany and China and the fumes coming up, if you’re a believer in carbon emission, the fumes coming up to make these massive windmills is more than anything that we’re talking about with natural gas, which is very clear. One other thing, solar-I love solar, but solar doesn’t quite have it yet. It’s not powerful yet to really run our big, beautiful factories that we need to compete with the world. It’s all a pipe dream, but you know what we’ll do? We’re going to have the greatest economy in the world, but if you want to kill the economy, get rid of your oil industry you want. And what about fracking? Now we have to ask him about fracking. You said it on tape. I'll put it on. Excuse me. He was against fracking. He said it. I will show that to you tomorrow. I am against fracking. Until he got the nomination, he went to Pennsylvania. Then he said, “But you know what Pennsylvania?” He’ll be against it very soon because his party is totally against it. The families that we’re talking about are employed heavily and they are making a lot of money, more money than they’ve ever made. If you look at the kind of numbers that we’ve produced for Hispanic, for Black, for Asian, it’s nine times greater the percentage gain than it was under in three years than it was under eight years of the two of them to put it nicely, nine times more. Now somebody lives, I have not heard the numbers or the statistics that you’re saying, but they’re making a tremendous amount of money. Economically, we saved it and I saved it again a number of months ago, when oil was crashing because of the pandemic. We saved it. Say what you want to bet relationship. We got Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Russia to cut back, way back. We saved our oil industry and now it’s very vibrant again and everybody has very inexpensive gasoline. Remember that. Would he close down the oil industry? Would you close down the oil industry? Oh, that's a big statement. That's a big statement. Oh, I see. Okay. That's a big statement. Yeah. We actually give it to solar and wind. That’s maybe the biggest statement. In terms of business, that’s the biggest statement. Because basically what he's saying is he is going to destroy the oil industry. Will you remember that Texas? Will you remember that Pennsylvania, Oklahoma? Remember that Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, Ohio. Is he going to get China to do it? Is he going to get China to do it? We have to make our country totally successful, as it was prior to the plague coming in from China. Now we’re rebuilding it and we’re doing record numbers, 11.4 million jobs in a short period of time, et cetera. But, I will tell you, go back. Before the plague came in, just before, I was getting calls from people that were not normally people that would call me. They wanted to get together. We had the best Black unemployment numbers in the history of our country. Hispanic, women, Asian, people with diplomas, with no diplomas, MIT graduates; number one in the class, everybody had the best numbers. And you know what? The other side wanted to get together. They wanted to unify. Success is going to bring us together. We are on the road to success. But I’m cutting taxes, and he wants to raise everybody’s taxes and he wants to put new regulations on everything. He will kill it. If he gets in, you will have a Depression, the likes of which you’ve never seen. Your 401(k)s will go to hell, and it’ll be a very, very sad day for this country.
















"
"94","10-23-20","Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And hello, Florida. I love Florida. It’s great to be with you and back at The Villages. I like The Villages. Turn the mic up. It’s great to be with you. It’s something I’ve wanted to do. I was here four years ago in some little ballroom that held about 400 people. And I said, “I want to be with The Village, everybody.” I said, “Get a field or do something. Just go out and get a field. Go out and get a field.” And that’s what they did. You got a lot of people here. And I see you driving around in those beautiful golf carts, the most beautiful carts. I wanted to get one. I’m going to get a golf cart like that. But you have the best and you’re always fighting for me and I’m always fighting for you. And I appreciate it. That’s why we’re here. And we had an exciting night last night with Sleepy Joe. But I’m always here to protect you, and love, cherish, defend our nation, seniors. And not all of you are seniors. I see a lot of people that are very young here. [inaudible 00:01:40]. And I see a lot of people that are young at heart, right? We’re young at heart, all of us, and the timeless values that make this nation the greatest nation anywhere in the world. Eleven days from now, we’re going to win the state of Florida. We’re going to win four more years in the White House. I think Joe Biden proved last night that he’s not capable of being President of the United States. Come on, Gabe. The country saw firsthand that this election is a choice between a Trump recovery, and I’ll call it because that’s what’s happening, it’s a Trump super recovery and a Biden depression because you will have a depression. Who has 401(k)s in this group? Anybody? If he got in, wave bye-bye to your 401(k) because it’s going down the tubes. It’s a choice between optimism, patriotic vision for American success, or Joe Biden’s dark, dismal, gloomy. Did you hear what he said last night about darkness, darkness, always darkness? But it’s a gloomy vision. We’re about the American dream, all about the American dream, greatest country in the world. Joe Biden is totally controlled by the radical socialist left. This country will never be a socialist country. Never. One of the most stunning moments last night was when Joe Biden admitted that he wants to abolish the oil industry. That wasn’t too good. Did you see him this morning? This morning, “I didn’t really need that. I didn’t mean that.” It was the last question they talked about that. I said, “Whoa, this is the big point of the evening.” Remember, I said, “Well, you want to get rid of oil and gas?” Is that … “Yeah, well, we want to phase it out.” I said, “Thank you. Texas are you watching? Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, Ohio are you watching now?” Now they’re going around, Kamala. Kamala is going around saying, “No, no, no. We want to keep it.” This woman is a super radical left. She’s against fracking. If they get in, they’ll end your energy independence. We have energy independence right now. They will end it very quickly. Now they’re going around trying to make … That was one of the, well, we’re going to have to see how it works out, but that could be one of the worst mistakes made in presidential debate history. We’re going to see. We hope it is. This is perhaps the most shocking admission ever made during a debate, where he goes in and he says no fracking. But he’s been saying it, no fracking. He got the nomination, all of the sudden, he’s fracking. No fossil fuels and no gas-powered cars. Ultimately, let’s not have cars. Let’s get rid of airplanes. How about that Senator from Hawaii, where she went along with the Green New Deal? When she said, “Yes, I’m in favor.” I said, “Yeah, but you’re not allowed to use airplanes under the Green New Deal.” And she’s in Hawaii. She said, “Well, I don’t know what to tell you.” And she says, “Maybe we can build a bridge to Hawaii instead.” She’s a beauty, isn’t she? She’s great. Biden’s plan would mean American seniors have no air conditioning during the summer, no heat during the winter, and no electricity during peak hours. It’s true. He wants wind. He wants to wind. When the wind doesn’t blow, “Let’s watch the president tonight, Darling, on television.” “I’m sorry, we can’t do it. The wind’s not blowing tonight.” Last night, Biden pledged to institute the most horrible and dangerous immigration policy ever in this country, catch and release. He wants to bring it back. It took me two years to get rid of it. That’s where you catch a criminal, it could be a rapist, could be a murder, a real criminal, and you just released criminal and say, “Please come back in four years.” Did you see what he said last night? He said, “Oh, and then they come back for court.” I said, “No, they don’t come back, Joe, 1%.” He said, “They come back.” No. I said, “Joe, you don’t know anything about it. They don’t come back.” This a very bad policy, Joe. They don’t come back. They need Perry Mason, but they don’t Perry Mason. They just don’t come back. Criminals and rapists and even murders are set free and they’re set free into our country. It’s ended now. It was very hard to get ended. What I had to do to end it, I will not tell you. I will not tell the people of The Villages. I won’t tell the people of The Villages. And by the way, you love it here, right? I don’t know. It’s an incredible, popular place. I see it so much. It’s incredible, the love, the spirit. So do you love the people that developed it? I think so, right? Right. It’s nice to have somebody but that wasn’t the same love as you had for the … No, no. Somebody did a good job. Thank you. Thank you. Look at this guy. Look. Beautiful. Look, it’s Uncle Sam. Come here, Uncle Sam. Look at this guy. Look. This is a hell of a day. Mr. Congressman, how are you? When are you getting married? Are you getting married soon? [inaudible 00:07:33] Don’t lose her, Congressman. You’ll be very depressed. Biden says America is nothing more than an idea, right? He also said, didn’t he say Antifa is just an idea too? So he’s saying … Only at The Villages could you say it. He said America was an idea. But come to think of it, he said Antifa’s an idea too, right? Well, America is not an idea. It’s a great country. I’ll tell you, it’s a great country. And America is our home. It’s a nation and it’s a nation that has borders. When you have borders, you have a nation. You take away the borders … They want to take away the borders. They want to take down the wall. The wall is now 400-plus miles long. How about that? And it goes very high and very low. It goes down deep for two reasons. To hold it up is one. That’s a good reason, but also for the tunnels. And Arizona’s very happy. We just got back, Pam, some numbers from Arizona. Very good. Numbers from Florida, I don’t want to talk to you, but look at all the fake news back there. I don’t want to talk about it. I don’t want to talk about it. Look at all those people. There’s the great John Roberts, who’s generally speaking, very good. John, generally. But he has bad moments. Hello, John. You having a good time? He’s a good guy. John is good. John is good. They’re not all fake, just about 85% of them. But isn’t it amazing? Some day, I’d like to make a speech without any press. Without any press. One little mistake and they try and take you out. And I do this four times a day. It’s crazy. So we’re going on a tour for the next 10 days. Can you believe it? We’re down to 10, 11 days. And we’ll be doing two or three of these and then four these, and then we’re going to end up five or six of these a day. Do you believe it? Is this any kind of a life? Is this a life? Who can do that? Who can do that? Do you think Sleepy Joe can do that? I don’t think so. I don’t think so. I don’t think he can do it. I knew there was a reason I wanted to be at The Villages. This is a hard thing. This was very hard. They said, “They have no field that’s large enough.” I said, “Do have a polo field someplace? Let’s get a polo field.” Looking at that equipment. Look at those helicopters. How good are they? Everything is good. 2.5 trillion, we should have good helicopters. But if Biden wins, your borders will be gone and your country will be gone, frankly., Look, this is not a man that’s capable. When I meet with these heads of state, the one thing I can tell you, they’re sharp. They’re sharp. They’re not off. They’re sharp. This is not a man that can handle the job. He leaves his house this morning, he gets up, and I’m going to talk about it. All he talks about is COVID, COVID, COVID because they want to scare people. And we’ve done so well with it. Now it’s 99.8%. I mean, you look at what’s going on and we’re rounding the turn. We’re rounding the corner. We’re rounding the corner beautifully. But Joe Biden was very disrespectful last night to President Barack Hussein Obama. You saw that. Barack Hussein Obama. Remember Rush Limbaugh would always do that. He’d do, “Barack Hussein Obama.” And Rush is doing okay. Rush is great, isn’t he? Do we love Rush? He’s got such guts and he’s going through a lot, but he’s got courage like you people have. He always has had courage. At last night’s debate, though, he was very disrespectful, really disrespectful. When he said that he, Joe, was vice president, not president, blaming Obama when trying to make excuses for the failed immigration policies, right? You saw that? “I wasn’t the president. It was him.” Because we talked about cages, right? I said, ” Joe, you built the cages.” Remember, they tried to say “cages for children.” And they said, “Trump built cages.” And then they found out it was a little problem. There was a picture in the New York Times, the failing New York Times. If you take a look at what its unfunded liability is, check it out sometime. It’s definitely failing. It’s only a question of when. But you take a look at the failing New York Times and they had a picture of a cage and they thought that I built it. And it said “cage.” And then somebody called me, they said, “Sir, that was built,” one of the people that helped build it, “that was built in 2014.” I said, “2014, I didn’t happen to be president.” It was built under Obama/Sleepy Joe Biden. And so did you notice when I kept saying, “Why did you build the cages, Joe? Why did you?” And he just kept talking. He didn’t want any part of it. But they started it. If you want jobs, safety, and borders, you have to vote for the party of Abraham Lincoln, Honest Abe. Vote Republican. And I’m voting early tomorrow in Florida. Do you believe that? I’m coming to vote. I came down here to vote. I actually came down here to see The Villages, and tomorrow morning I’m voting here as opposed to sending it in, you know, just mail it. I liked being able to vote. I’m old fashioned I guess. I like to get online and I have to stand there for two hours, maybe they’ll move you up a little bit. But I liked the vote. So I’m coming, I’m going to be voting here tomorrow. And I urge every one of you to go and vote. And I don’t think I have to urge too many. How many people here have already voted? That’s incredible. Thank you. Look at you. How many people here have voted for President Trump? How many people here have voted for Sleepy Joe Biden, please? I don’t see any hands. I tend to believe them. Sleepy Joe, no, he’s not the guy. For 47 years, Joe Biden sent American jobs to China and other nations while the Bidens vacuum up. Look, did you see what’s going on with his son? I mean, he goes into a country, the guy leaves with volumes of money, vacuum up millions of dollars all over the globe. Last night, Joe lied straight to the American people. He claimed that he had never taken a penny from any foreign source, ever in my life, ever. I mean, he goes to think of it, his son, without a job knows nothing about energy. These young people in the front, do you know anything about energy? No. She said, no. She knows more than Hunter. Remember, where is Hunter? By the way, where the hell is Hunter? Where’s Hunter? Remember the t-shirt? I said one time, “Where’s Hunter,” the next day they had a t-shirt, “Where’s Hunter?” There he is. Hunter, you gained weight. But you look even better. You still look better. Anyway. No, but think of it, he gets lined up with this Ukrainian energy company, not the highest reputation. $ 183,000 a month to be on the board, right? Gets a $3 million upfront payment. Then that’s only the first nation that he goes. He has no knowledge of energy whatsoever. Anybody in this audience knows more. They then go to China. Let’s go to China. He gets 1.5 billion to manage, meaning millions of dollars a year in fees. He then goes to Russia, he got three and a half million from the mayor of Moscow’s wife, three and a half million dollars. And Obama was in charge of all of that stuff. Then they stole the premier, they stold the submarine port, Russia. And Russia takes it. And he’s in charge of Russia, but he got three and a half million dollars. So what’s going on with that? So he was in charge of Ukraine, China, Russia. That was sort of a responsibility of the vice president. And he got money from all of them. And he got it from his son and the son made no money for years. And all of a sudden he’s making all this money. They’re corrupt politicians. Okay. You say what you want. And then you see the notes, and you see the gentleman that got up yesterday and you see what he had to say. He’s a legitimate person. But you see the notes that you see that Joe gets 10% of everything, right? And Pammy got 50% of something. And then the guy has the deal in China where he wants to get $10 million a year, 10 million a year for introductory purposes. In other words, he’s going to introduce people. You know who he’s going to introduce, his father, that’s who he’s going to introduce. It’s a bad deal. It’s a bad deal. It’s corrupt as hell. I don’t care what you say. It’s corrupt as hell. Okay. And they like to also, when they say, “Oh, well, what about you and your kids?” I don’t do deals. I don’t do deals. I used to do more deals. I was the king of deals. But I don’t do deals. Like you tell my kids, you can’t, it’s a conflict, just don’t do it. So, it’s possibly allowed. It probably is allowed. But I say, “We don’t need it. Just don’t do them.” My kids, these kids have done such a good job. They have done such a good job. And they don’t do deals. The Bidens got rich while America got robbed. And how did Biden get so wealthy spending a half a century in public office? He’s been in public office for 47 years, almost 50 years. He used his office for personal profit at your expense, and my expense, and all of our expenses. In 2016, Florida voted to fire this [inaudible 00:18:08] political establishment. And you elected an outsider as president who is finally putting America first and putting The Villages first, putting The Villages. We’re putting The Villages first. And if I don’t sound like a typical Washington politician it’s because I’m not a politician. And if I don’t always play by the rules of the Washington establishment, the deep state, the RINOs. The RINOs are almost worse than our enemy. The RINOs, we love those RINOs. Republican in name only. You know what that is, right? Republican in name only. We got a lot of them. But it is slowly disappearing. It’s amazing. They disappear into the woods. But if I don’t always play by the rules of the Washington establishment, it’s because I was elected to fight for you and I fought for you harder than any president has ever fought for anybody. And with your vote, we’ll continue to cut taxes. I got you the largest tax cut in the history of our country. Cut regulations, lower drug prices. Your drugs will be going down 60, 70, 80% because I’m instituting what’s called the favored nations clause. You see all the commercials the drug companies are running against me? It’s unbelievable. It’s unbelievable. This is why I see politicians. This is one of the many reasons why. The other reason is that the biggest lobbyist, the biggest donator by far are the drug companies. Very powerful, a lot of money. They are taking commercials at me. I don’t care. I’m doing the right thing. I instituted a favored nations clause where the United States, right now we pay the highest price of any country in the world by far, it’s not even close. It’s not even close. You can have a pill that sells for 25 cents identical and in the United States could sell for $3. That’s how bad it is. It’s terrible. So I instituted what we call a favored nations clause. So we will now go, we will be paying the lowest price, match the lowest price anywhere in the world. And I’m getting hit hard on that one, but that’s okay, Pam. Is that okay? I’ll have to withstand, the commercials are unbelievable. They’re unbelievable, but that’s okay. People get it. We want to support our police, protect our second amendment. They want to take your second amendment away. Defend our borders, maintain energy independence, and ensure more products are proudly stamped with the phrase, that gorgeous phrase, made in the USA. We’ll deliver record prosperity, epic growth, and a safe vaccine is quickly coming that will help end, by the way it’s ending anyway, it’s going to end. You’re going to have surges. Look at Europe. They have a surge. Then it goes down. Look at Florida. You have a great governor by the way. You have a great governor. And you have an even better first lady, but I won’t say that. Now you have a great governor. In fact, the governor is going to go to Canada. I gave him the right. He’s going to Canada, where they pay 50% less for the same drug. And he’s going to buy for the state of Florida, until this favored nations kicks in, where you go down 70, 80, 90%. And last year was the first year in 53 years, that drug prices in this country went down. Not by much, but they went down. They didn’t go up. 1%, not much, not proud, 1%, but with favored nations, you’ll go down 50, 60, 70, maybe even 80% in drug prices. But I gave your governor the right to go to Canada and buy drugs in Canada. The same exact drug from the same factory, same company, 50% and even more discount. And so you’re going to start seeing it fast. And then ultimately the favored nations will kick in. So I better be president when all this stuff happens. Can you imagine it’s all done? Can you imagine if sleepy Joe said, “I’ve done a very good job on drug pricing.” “What did you do, Joe?” “I don’t know. I don’t know what I did.” Thank you very much. We’re going to quickly end this pandemic, this horrible plague that came in from China. They should have stopped it and we’re not going to forget what they did. We’re not forgetting at all. I’d signed a great trade deal with China. Recently they had the biggest order of corn in the history of our country. Biggest order of soybeans, biggest order of beef, but you know what? It’s no longer the same to me. Doesn’t mean the same. Would have been great. I would have been so proud of it, but now I don’t view it the same. Normal life. That’s all we want. Normal life will fully resume. We had the greatest economy in our history. And next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country, we’re doing it. We’ve got this. We have a super V going up. If you look at housing, if you look at cars, if you look at car production, nobody can believe the numbers and you’re going to have a number released very soon. And the number is going to be… Think of it. Think of this. You’re going to have a GDP. Now the Fed, Atlanta, I believe the Atlanta Fed projected GDP of 35% in the third quarter. I don’t know if it’s going to be 35. In any event that would be higher than any GDP ever in history. And many times higher than our highest, which I think was like seven or 8%. 35%, we’ll see. We’ll see. Whether it was 20%, it was 12%, I’d say it was great. But they just came out, they said 35. Who knows if they’re right. We’re going to see. Here’s the goodness news, it’s going to be announced right before November 3rd, right before. And I’m willing to take my chances, being a gambling man, I’m willing to take my chances. I think it’s going to be a magnificent, whether it’s 25, 35, 20, no matter what it is, it’s going to be a great number because we’re doing numbers like nobody would believe. We thought we’d have an unemployment of 40, 42%. You know what it was? It dropped down to 7.8%. And yesterday, Larry Kudlow called, the great Larry Kudlow. And he said, by a certain it’s 5.8%. Think of that. And we’re in the midst of rounding out, but in the midst of a pandemic. It’s actually amazing what everybody has done. And I’ve been given a lot of help with some of the people over here. I gave you the largest tax cut and reforms in American history, and we will cut taxes further. And we’re cutting taxes for the middle class. We’re cutting taxes for people that need jobs and nobody’s ever done it at a level like we’ve done it. By contrast sleepy Joe Biden will give you the single biggest tax hike in the history of our country. He’s talking about quadrupling taxes, 4 trillion in taxes so he can waste it on the green new deal. The green new deal, no cars, no airplanes, no cows. No cows, you know. Whatever happened? Did they ever leave the cows in? I think they had to take that out, right [inaudible 00:06:53]. Originally, it was no cows. They didn’t want to have any cattle or cows, which is pretty brutal when you think of it, right? He’ll bury you in regulations, dismantle your police departments, dissolve our borders, confiscate your guns, terminate religious liberty, destroy your suburbs. I’m always saying, I’ll tell you this, the fraudulent media. So I always get up and I have fun. Please, please, suburban women. You should love me. I ended the regulation that’s going to destroy the suburbs. Please, please, suburban women. You should love me. Because somebody said, I’m not doing that well with suburban women. I said, “Why?” Last time I was supposed to be doing terribly with women, then I got 52%. They said, what the hell happened with Trump and women all of a sudden? Remember they said Trump did well with women. So how’d it go? Hey, so I get it, I get it. I say, “Please, please, suburban women, please, please love me, suburban women. I want you to love me because I got rid of the regulation that’s going to destroy your neighborhood. You don’t want to have projects next year house. You don’t want to have crime in the suburbs, et cetera, right? So I go on 60 minutes and she says, Lesley Stahl, that’s another beauty. She goes, “You were begging, you were begging suburban women to love you, weren’t you?” I said, “No, no, I was just having fun. We were just having fun.” These people are sick. They are bad. They are bad. But they want to decimate Florida seniors and seniors, all seniors, okay? And by the way, what I’ve done for suburban women, but suburban people, people that live in the suburbs, that’s really the dream. That’s the American dream. And you know, 30% of the people, because people say, “Oh, is that racist?” 30% of the people living in the suburbs are minority groups, Hispanic American, black American. Think of it, Asian American. 30, 31% are from minority groups. For years Joe Biden fought to cut your social security. He wanted to cut it. He wanted to knock it out and Medicare, which Joe has now falsely denied. You notice? Oh, I loved it yesterday. The way he denied that. So does that mean you want to get rid of fossil fuel Joe? Oh yes. That’s what it means. Thank you. This debate let’s end it. Let’s end it right now. By the way I got treated, I thought, very fairly by the anchor. I thought, right, Kristen, I was surprised. She’s been a little bit rough on me over the years. I was surprised, but her network has been crazy, NBC con test, C-O-N con test. I thought Kristen did a very good job yesterday. Some people said she interrupted me much more than she interrupted sleep Joe. But that’s because he didn’t have that much to say, so. But no, I thought she was fair. I said it to her in the show, I said, “I think you’ve handled it very professionally.” It’s not easy. So today I want to show you Joe Biden’s own words. The video I’m about to play was created by Bernie Sanders, crazy Bernie. You know, Bernie is the single greatest loser. The way he loses, he gets sportsmanship of the year, right? What they did to him four years ago was quite terrible. What they did to him was even… Then he just goes back to Congress and talks. He’s crazy Bernie. A lot of his people are going to come with us because you know why? They love our trade policy. Because he, like me, understands how badly we’ve been taken advantage of by other countries, including our allies by the way. The video I’m about to play was created by crazy Bernie earlier this year to expose Joe Biden’s atrocious record and his egregious lies. Go ahead, play it Mr Deville. I’ll tell you what, do these people do a good job? Do they do a good job? No, he’s a liar. He lies about everything. He’s now lying about not being a corrupt politician. I called him last night. I don’t want to say that, but he’s a corrupt politician and he’ll lie. But he lied about that. He lied about fracking and he’ll look at you and he’ll lie. He goes, “There will be no fracking. There will be no fracking.” This goes on for a year. Then he goes to Pennsylvania. He says. “There’ll be fracking.” And then you’ll say, “Well, wait, you said there will be none.” He’ll say, “No. I never said that.” This guy is either really stupid or he lies, at a level that nobody’s ever seen before. By the way, that’s a great video. Who did that video? I love that video. Who the hell did it? I have some good, talented people. Under my leadership, no one will touch your Medicare and nobody will touch your social security, okay? By the way, that’s a devastating video. I just saw it for the first time. That’s devastating. Now Biden’s pushing free government healthcare, which is socialized medicine and mass amnesty for illegal aliens, meaning he wants to take care of illegal aliens before he takes care of our seniors. And you know, the problem is we all want to take care of everybody. But if you ever do that, where you give Medicare, you give free everything, including education, you’re going to have this country swamped with millions and millions of people from all over the world, wanting to pour in to get. You can’t do it. And it would obliterate your Medicare and your social security, totally obliterate it. Joe Biden cares more about illegal aliens that he does about senior citizens. And that’s true. And you see it in that clip. I believe that American seniors must come first, okay? Must come first. That’s true. Must come first. Last night, Biden outlined a plan, to create socialized medicine, raiding Medicare, to fund his government takeover. Biden’s running mate, the most liberal member of the United States Senate… By the way, Kamala will not be your first female president. She will not be your first female president. That’s not the way it’s supposed to be. We’re not supposed to have the socialist… Look, we’re not going to be a socialist nation. We’re not going to have a socialist president, especially a female socialist president. We’re not going to have it. We’re not going to put up with it. It’s not going to happen. Most liberal member, more so than Bernie of the US Senate, co-sponsors a socialist healthcare plan to end Medicare, as you know it, and Medicare works, Medicare works. We love our Medicare. It does work. And eliminate Medicare advantage, which nearly 2 million Florida seniors depend on, including one out of every two Hispanic seniors. You see how well I’m doing with Hispanic? Do you see? They’re going crazy. No, they’re going crazy. They don’t know what happened. They go like our Democrat rivals that have it a lot of times. African American doing well, Hispanic, Hispanic is like, they don’t know what’s going on. Not the Hispanics I’m talking the Democrats are saying, “What the hell is going on here?” You’re going to have a big surprise. You know that beautiful, beautiful… You heard about the red wave, right? It’s called the great wave. We’re all waiting for that great red wave. But we’re supposed to be… All these votes are going to come in and then we catch them up later on because our people like to go to vote, like me, but we catch up later on. There’s only one problem, in a lot of cases we’re already winning. This is before the wave. We’re already winning. So a lot of interesting things are happening and those guys back there are saying… Well, some of them like it I think, but you know, the interesting thing, without me, you know, what’s going to happen to their ratings? Bom, bom. Can you imagine if you had four years of covering sleepy Joe? It wouldn’t be four years. Since I took office, we’ve reduced Medicare advantage premiums by 34%. Good management. Socialist healthcare programs, like the one supported by Biden and Harris always end up denying coverage to the sick and the elderly in order to reduce the soaring cost. Our opponents want to turn America into a communist Cuba, into a socialist Venezuela. If you look at the ideology that these people are talking about, take a look at Portland with the anarchists all over the place. By the way, we’re asking the governor for approval to go in and clean out that mess, which has been going on for 140 days. But it’s really been going on for many years. It’s been going on like at Portland, anarchists, and it’d be so easy. Look at what we did in Minneapolis. After 10 days of rioting and everything else, we sent in the National Guard. They lined up. They lined up again, again, again. World’s most expensive outfits, 250,000 a piece. Helmets and the like are solid computer, right? And they had their tear gas, they had their pepper spray, which the Democrats don’t want you to use. They don’t want you to use anything. They want you to get hit. They want you to get hit with rocks and stones. But they had their tear gas and they just marched forward. And in one and a half hour, the whole thing was over. It was all over. The only problem is they should have called us in sooner. If Biden wins, the radical left will transform this country into something that you will not recognize. They want to shatter the middle-class with trillions of dollars of new taxes, four trillion dollars, pack the Supreme court with far left judges, 16, 18, 20. And how do you like Amy Coney Barrett? Everybody. She’s great. She’s great. She made them look a little foolish, didn’t she? As the Democrats went after her, it was like, bomp. “What do you have written down? What do you have written down on your pad?” ” Nothing.” That’s cool. Happened to be a Republican that asked the question. Figure that one out, right? They want to unleash the violent rioters, criminal aliens, MS-13 killers, and they will indoctrinate your grandchildren and your children with poisonous anti-American lies in their schools, which I ended, which we’ve ended. If you want your grandchildren to grow up in a free nation where they can speak their minds and pursue the American dream then you must defeat Sleepy Joe Biden and the radical left. Have to do it. And it’s not really Joe. Look, let’s face it. Joe doesn’t have a clue, but he’s surrounded by people that definitely they’ve got some problems. You’ve got to recheck the left wing fascism and vote for American freedom. Our country is set to be greater than ever before. Watch, watch. We’re set. We’re joined today by some incredible people, and the man I just mentioned, he’s just a friend of mine. He said, “I’d love to run for Governor.” And he did run and I endorsed him and he ran and he went like a rocket ship. He was a great candidate. He had to run a candidate against a very, very powerful, very powerful, great Democrat with a tremendous future. They said, “He’s going to be the future of the Democrat Party.” How’s he doing, by the way? Is he doing fine? I think Ron did him a favor by beating him. He did the Democrats a favor by beating him, right? But Ron DeSantis became your Governor. You have an incredible first lady in Casey DeSantis, decides, and they’re here. Hey, Ron, how are we doing? If we don’t win, I’ll never speak to him again. A warrior, a great guy that has always been there for me. He’s tough. He’s strong. He’s smart. Congressman Mike Waltz. Congressman. And a man with maybe the greatest name in politics, who also, whenever you need him, he’s there and he loves your state and he loves our country. Daniel Webster. How’s that name? How is that name? Hello, Daniel. What a name. With a name like that, how can you lose it in politics? Daniel Webster. Congressional candidate, who’s way ahead in the polls, Kat Cammack. She’s way ahead. How’s that number looking, Kat? It’s huge. She’s known great. She’s a future star. And a future current and past star and a really great friend of mine, somebody that has always been there, former Florida Attorney General, she could have anything she wanted, by the way, anything, former Attorney General, Pam Bondi. Great woman, great person. She could have anything she wants. When you’re going back into running or something, or anytime you don’t want to come into the administration, just call. But I hear she’s doing very well, to put it mildly, right? All Biden and his handlers in the media want to talk about today is COVID, COVID, COVID. You know that. You just turn on CNN, look, their light just went off, you turn on CNN, you turn on MSDNC, you turn on these networks, there’s COVID, COVID, COVID. On November 4th, you won’t hear anything about it because we are rounding that turn. You won’t hear. But they wanted to scare you to try to make you vote for Biden. That’s all he can talk about because his record is horrible. And by the way, his record with the H1N1, which he always refers to as swine flu, was horrendous. The person that ran it, his chief of staff, right, Steve, ran it, the person, the chief of staff said it was a catastrophe. “We didn’t know what we were doing.” It was an absolute disaster. Now he’s going to come in and tell us what to do. Do you ever see where he said, “You were late,” except when I closed it to China, he said I shouldn’t close it. For two and a half months he said I shouldn’t lose it then he ultimately admitted that he was wrong. And then he amazingly got a nomination, which he should have never gotten because you know why? Pocahontas, if she would have gotten out three days early, it’s true. She took all of Bernie’s on Super Tuesday. It’s true. Do you agree with that, Congressman? She took all of his votes away. All he needed was a few more of us. He would have won every state. So you have somebody that really got a little bit lucky. In prime time, they used to call him 1% Joe. Now, in far less than prime time, he gets the nomination. Figured this one. Only in the world of politics can this happen. But if you watch CNN and MSDNC, the networks, that’s all they talk about. They focus on case numbers, case numbers. You know why we have so many case numbers? Because we do more testing than any country in the world times five, 10, 20. You have many countries don’t do any testing so they don’t have any cases. You have many, many countries that have very few cases because they don’t do testing. We test. We have tests like you wouldn’t believe. We got started because the fake news would say, “Where’s the testing?” We did more. We have the best tests in the world, and there’s plenty good about testing too. The bad thing is you find cases. Baron Trump, young man, 14, strong. So he tests positive. I said, “Oh, that’s terrible.” They said, “No, it’s okay.” The doctor, great doctor, White House doctor, Sean. I said, 15 seconds later, “How’s Baron doing?” “He’s all better, sir.” I said, “What are you talking about?” The fact that is young people, 99.99 or something young people, their immune systems, I hate to say it, they’re a little stronger than our immune systems, right? Well, I got it and here we are. Here we are. It works out good. Here we are. And the good news, once you get it, you’re immune. Now, it used to be before I got it you were immune for life. I heard you were immune for life. Once I got it, they said, “No, it’s only four months.” Okay. We have a double standard. You ever notice that? It was always once you get it, you’re immune. I get it, “Nope. It’s only good for four months.” It’s the fake news. Last night, Biden in his very weak debate performance, did you see some of the debates, 91% to 9%, 91% in my favor, 91 to 9, I like that, I like the sound of that, but last night he said, “America is entering a dark winter.” Isn’t that really inspirational? He’s running for President. Think of it. We have this guy that can’t even speak and he goes, “We’re entering a dark winter.” So inspirational, but he’s trying to scare people, basically. He’s trying to get something because he’s been such a failure at every level of government that this is something. But what they don’t remember is the swine flu and how bad it was. I bring that up whenever I can. But we’re not entering a dark winter. We’re entering the final turn and approaching the light at the end of the tunnel. That’s the way I look at it. I took very rapid action to ban travel from China and Europe. And Biden opposed it. We pioneered incredible therapies and we reduced the fatality rate by 85%. Think of that, what we’ve learned, what we’ve learned. And we went out and we made just incredible things. The equipment we made, the equipment that we bought, the ventilators. We’re the king of ventilators now as a country. Everybody has ventilators. We’re sending them all over the world. We’re making them by the thousands. We’re the only one who could do anything like that. It’s the biggest mobilization of anything since World War Two, the ventilator, the big thing. And I’m working to make the antibody treatment that I received available free to anybody that needs it, and they will have it done pretty soon. All I know I can talk to this group, because we have something to get comment. All I know is I didn’t feel too good, and it’s been a long time since I didn’t feel so good. I didn’t have time to feel bad, right? But I didn’t feel so good. I said, “Doc, I’m not feeling too great here. And he said, “Let me check it out. Oh, you’re positive.” That’s not what I wanted to hear. But I can’t put myself into a basement of the White House. I don’t have that luxury. No, no, I’m the President of the United States. I can’t put myself into a beautiful bedroom and not come out for a year and a half someplace at the White House. I’ve got to work. I meet with military leaders. I meet with foreign leaders. I meet with Gold Star families. I meet with so many people. I can’t close myself up. And I say, “Oftentimes, I just met a lot of people. That’s risky.” And then one day I got it. I mean, I got it. And the First Lady got it. But we got it. You see a lot of people, but we have a job to do. And we beat it and we beat it and we beat it. It was good. But I will tell you, I wasn’t feeling great and I’m laying in bed, and one thing when you’re President, you’re going to find this out, Mr. Congressman, one thing, when you’re President, you’re not feeling good, you’re laying in a bed, you’ve got more doctors than any human being has ever had. I had 12 doctors, I had doctors from the greatest schools in the world. John’s Hopkins was there and Walter Reed Medical Center. These people are unbelievable, the job they do. The job they do for our incredible soldiers, our wounded warriors, our people that come home that are badly injured, badly hurt, the job they do is incredible. So I’m laying there not feeling my best, and every doctor had a different specialty, and I had more hands on me than any human being, and I didn’t like it. I said, “Come on, let’s make this quick.” But the bottom line is I took this Regeneron, it’s called, and I wake up the next morning and I felt like Superman. It’s like, “Get me out of here. I’ve got to get back to the people.” I don’t know. Maybe it works. Maybe it doesn’t. Maybe it was me. No, there he is. Superman. Look at that. Super Trump. Wow. Look at this guy. Do you live at the villages? I don’t think so. Do you? You don’t. Do you really? This guy lives at the villages. I think I’ll move in. I have an idea. I will sell Mar-A-Lago, and I’ll move to the villages. You know what? It’s not the worst idea. I like that idea. I like that idea. I like the people here. We’ll have 100 million vaccine doses before the end of this year and seniors will be the first in line. We’re taking care of our seniors. Under my plan, you will get incredible lifesaving therapies. Our therapies are incredible. Remdesivir just got approved. You saw that. Just today got approved. And the FDA has moved at a pace that they’ve never moved before. They’re approving things in weeks which used to take years. That’s a little prodding for me, I have to be honest with you. But they’re doing it. They’re doing it. They’re doing a great job. You will get a vaccine that ends the epidemic or the pandemic and it ends it and eradicates it. But without it, it goes away. But with it, it goes away faster, and it’s going to happen very, very soon. You’re going to have it very soon. A lot of great companies are right there. You’ll get to see your friends, families, and loved ones and you’ll get to enjoy being with them in their golden years. It’s a sad thing where you can’t be near people. I mean, did you ever hear of anything like this? You can’t be near people when they’re in trouble. But where we’re going to be very close. We’re very, very close. You watch. Under Biden’s land, you’ll be locked down for years. The cure will be worse than the problem itself. Remember that. You’ve got to lead your life. And you know what? Some people want to say it and that’s good. Do it, do it. I’m like, lead your life, right? And some people agree with me. But if you want to stay in, if you want to do what you’re doing, you do it. If you want to get out and you want to be careful and socially distance and all of the things, you could wear a mask if you can’t socially distance, but there are a lot of things you can do. But some people want to stay in. And that’s okay. There’s nothing wrong with it. But you’re going to have a vaccine and it’s going to be an incredible success. Wait until you see these vaccines that they’re coming out with, and you’re going to have therapeutics and therapies and cures. To me, the cure or the therapy is more important than the vaccine. Not everybody agrees. I think you go in, and even the fact that it’s there, Regeneron, it had a hell of an effect on me. And somebody said I looked better last night than I used to. And I said, “I think it was Regeneron.” But to me, I don’t know, maybe not everybody agrees, but to me knowing that there’s something that can knock it out, to me, is actually more important than a vaccine. But the vaccines are coming. Therapeutics are already here and coming, and, in my opinion, the therapeutics in some cases are already cures. Under my administration, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world, and now we’re doing it again. So it’s called Make America Great Again, Again. Right? Make America Great Again, Again. So we’re going to change all the hats. You’re going to have to go out to buy a new one. It’s going to have again, again, exclamation point. In my first three years, we increased family income over $6,000, more than five times the gains in all eight years under the last administration. Think of what that means. African American unemployment, Hispanic American unemployment, and Asian American unemployment all reached their lowest levels ever recorded. we lifted nearly seven million Americans out of poverty, including more than 1.5 million Hispanic Americans. And when the virus hit, we experienced the smallest contraction, think of that, the smallest of any major country and the fastest recovery of any country in the world. We’re recovering at a level that nobody’s seen. And that’s despite the fact the Democrat Governors have a lot of their states closed. When you look at Michigan, although we just won the court case against her, the only one that was given freedom was her husband, he was the only one that was allowed to go sailing on the lake. Nobody else could do it. But we just won the case. It was unconstitutional what she was doing. She was running it like a prison camp. And you have Pennsylvania, you have North Carolina, and you have other places, they’ve got to open them up. I guarantee, November 4th they’ll say, “Well, we’ve decided to open.” They just want to keep the numbers down as much as possible. It’s not going to help them. Since April, we’ve created a record 11.4 million jobs. Under Biden, it 30 months to recover more than half of the jobs lost to the crisis. We did it in five months. Think of that. 30 months, my, my. And they had the slowest recovery in history or in 1929, since 1929. They don’t know which, they say it both ways. But 1929’s a long time ago. It was the slowest recovery since 1929. We’ve achieved energy independence, and we’ve done it while protecting our pristine environment. I recently signed an order placing a moratorium on offshore drilling off the coast of Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and I decided to add Florida. Is that okay? We added Florida. We didn’t want to make you too unhappy. No, we added Florida right at the beginning. Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure border in U.S. history and we’re finishing the wall 400 miles and Mexico is paying for the wall. You do know that, okay? They like to say, “After years of fighting for it,” I made a terrible mistake, I should have said, “We will not build the wall. We will never ever build a wall. We will never build the wall,” and the Democrats would have insisted that I build it. We should have done that. If we did that, we’d have no problem. It took me two years to get this thing done. But when you’re a developer from New York or a developer anywhere, getting financing is always not so hard. The Biden-Harris plan would also increase refugee admission by over 700%. Think of that. Refugee admission. This is agreed to this. We call it The Manifesto between Joe and Crazy Bernie, and AOC plus three too. She’s a great student. She drew the environmental plan. She’s a great student of the environment. How many days do you think she spent at her college studying the environment? Three? They pledged to terminate all national security travel bans. They will open the flood gates to radical Islamic terrorism, and you saw what happened in France just the other day. And we send our sincere best wishes to the President Macron who’s doing a good job, not an easy job. I’m keeping the terrorist jihadist and violent extremist out of our country. Keep them the hell out. I instituted a ban and they all said I was a bad guy, but you know what, I’ll be a bad guy. Does anybody object to the ban on having radical Islam come in? The radical Islamic terrorists, no, we do have a ban. We invested $2.5 trillion in rebuilding our US military. It’s the best and strongest it’s ever been, all made in the USA. With the best equipment in the world, hypersonic rockets go seven times faster than what we have right now. Think of it, we have the greatest military than we’ve ever had. And when I came here first, the world’s most overrated general said to me, sir, we have no ammunition. I said, that’s not good. No president should ever hear that. Well, we now have ammunition like we’ve never had ammunition before. And for our veterans, we have veterans here, we passed VA Choice and VA Accountability. Thank you, fellows. Thank you. VA Choice, VA Accountability, and everyone said that could never happen. We just got a 91% approval rating from the Vets. That’s never happened. It’s never been anyone near there. You ever remember, you were growing up, we were living it, every night they’d have on the news these horror stories about the Vets and how bad they were? You don’t see that anymore. Now, they’ll go out and they’ll find a Vet someplace or somehow, and you’ll see it tonight. There he is, look, Uncle Sam is unhappy. Look at this guy. You look good. Wow. Wow. 105-years-old, wow. Beautiful. Beautiful couple. Beautiful. Thank you very much. Wow. Thank you very much. 105. You look like you’re, to me, about 68. You look beautiful. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Beautiful. That’s great. We killed the leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi. We took out the mass murderer of American troops. Soleimani is dead. I withdrew from the last administration’s Iran nuclear deal. I recognize the true capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. And instead of never ending wars in the Middle East, we have now for the first time, very close to Middle East peace without blood all over the sand. We just signed another day. We just signed another one today, UAE, Bahrain and today Sudan, and we have them lined up. Nobody thought this was going to happen. It turns out that I’m the peace president. Nobody thought that. Remember? They used to say, he’ll be at war. Remember? They said North Korea, you would have been had Hillary won, crooked Hillary, you’d be at war, a nuclear war with North Korea. Whatever happened to that war? Remember? Biden will trap us in nothing but endless Middle East wars and other wars because he has no clue. I did more in 47 months and sleepy Joe Biden did in 47 years. It’s true. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans. It’s a vote for the American dream. It really is. It is. It’s a vote for the American dream. Over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world, and we will end our reliance on China once and for all. That’s already started. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults or law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities where we protect criminals. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to life, and we will keep, remember this. We will hold on to our second amendment, let me put it very simply. Because your second amendment is in serious … Your second amendment without me is in serious trouble. I’ll tell you think about this. When you think about it, I said the other day, it’s I’m standing here. We got the Democrats, we got the fake news, we got the lame stream media. We have the big tech. We have the rhinos. We have the deep state. We have bad Republicans, mostly good. We had a 96% approval rating the other day in the Republican Party and 53% overall. Did you see that 53%? That scares them. They don’t like the 53%. 53% does not lose elections. In history, in history when you’re at 53%, you don’t lose elections. So they’re getting a little bit nervous now. But we’ve had all these different groups and here we stand and we have the White House and they don’t. Think of it, we have the White House and they don’t. And we stopped them from doing very bad things. We will strike down terrorists who threatened our citizens and we will keep America out of these endless, ridiculous, long term, foreign wars. 19 years in Afghanistan. They’re all coming home. You’re welcome. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. We will end surprise medical billing, require the biggest thing that you want me to see, price transparency. Doesn’t sound like much. It’s bigger than health. It’s already done, kicks in on January 1st. Further reduce the cost of prescription drugs [inaudible 01:03:40] and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. Always. Always. America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. And NASA is now the most incredible thing that you’ve ever seen. And let me tell you, when I took over three and a half years ago, it was an abandoned mess. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. We live by the timeless words of our national motto, in God we trust. For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now, you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of Florida. For the last four years, I have been going to the battle for you with everything I have. There has never been a president who has been treated so badly as I have. It’s all turning. All just fine. And by the way, this should never happen to another president. We caught them spying on our campaign. We caught them cheating. We caught them doing all sorts of really bad things. They should really honestly, will happen to them what they did us. They spied, they cheated. It’s treason. Let’s see what happens. Let’s see what happens. But it’s a disgrace and it should never, ever happen to another president. But now I am relying on you to get your friends, to get your family, to get your neighbors, get you to coworkers and get out and vote. So important. From Tampa to Tallahassee, from Jacksonville to Fort Lauderdale, places I all know very much. From Pensacola, where I’m going in a little while to the villages. We stand on the shoulders of red blooded American Patriots, who poured out their heart, sweat, and soul, and you did that. You poured out your heart. You poured out your sweat and your soul to secure our liberty, our liberty, right, and defend our great freedom as a nation. We inherit the legacy of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blazed the trails, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, laid down the railroads, dug out the Panama Canal, raised up the great skyscrapers, won two World Wars, defeated fascism and communism. And from here in this beautiful state landed our brave American astronauts on the face of the moon. We made America into the single greatest nation in the history of the world and the best is yet to come. Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. That’s what we’re doing. With your help, your devotion, your drive, we’re going to keep on working, we’re going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement and there has never been a movement like this. There’s never been crowds like this. There’s never been crowds. And this isn’t even a rally. This is a stop at the villages. This isn’t a rally. I have a rally in a little while in Pensacola, but this isn’t a rally. This is a stop at the villages to say hello to people that have been with me so long.. I’ve been seeing it. I’ve been seeing it. You’re willing to get in fights from your golf carts. You’re willing to do whatever the hell. Where is that person? I love that person. I love our people. But this is just as friendly stop at the villages and look what happens. It’s a beautiful thing. It’s a beautiful thing. But there never has been a movement like this. There’s been movements, but you’ve never had. When Joe Biden’s stops, if he has three, four people. I mean, no, seriously, he has the circles, the little circles, which I love. The guy that does the circle is very good. I’m a perfectionist, nice, big, beautiful yellow. They’re very far apart because he can’t get any people. There’s only five of them and they have a hard time filling them up. And here we have thousands of people no matter where we go. There has never been a movement like this. And it’s a movement of loving our country. It’s a movement of not letting these maniacs take over our country and destroy it. So, I just think it’s such a great honor to finally be with the villages. I wanted to do this so long. I wanted to do it last time. And I told you I did, but they gave me this big ballroom. They hold not enough people and the place was packed outside, but this is really great. And I want to thank my people for putting this together. This was great. We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And we gather with the incredible, unbelievable, beautiful people of the villages in Florida. We have made America powerful again. We have made America wealthy again. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again. We have made America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, villages. We love you, villages. Thank you. Great to be here. Thank you. Thank you. Get out and vote.

"95","10-24-20","Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. And hello, Circleville Circleville. And it’s great to be back in Ohio to celebrate the return of Big Ten football with a big victory today for the Buckeyes, 52 to 17, not bad, not bad. Do you remember how this all happened? Sleepy Joe said, “President Trump didn’t want to have football.” I said, “What the hell is he talking about?” Sleepy Joe. So I said, “What’s the problem with football?” They said, “Big Ten football is shut down.” I said, “Well, he said I did it?” Yeah, he blamed me. I said, “I had nothing to do with it.” So then I said, “I got an idea. I’m going to get it open, if it’s shut down.” Right? That’s what happened. I think he even took an ad, “President Trump shut down football.” I didn’t think about it, I must tell you. I’m thinking about China, and I’m thinking about a lot of other things. So I said, “You know what we’ll do? We’ll teach Sleepy Joe and that group that don’t have what it takes, we’ll teach them how to do it.” And I worked hard to bring back Big Ten. And I got together with your commissioner. He did a good job. And we got it back. And today, you won your football game, and we’re very happy about it, because I know that life in Ohio is not complete without the glory of Ohio State football and other football. I’m glad you won the game. I wouldn’t have wanted to come… Can you imagine if you lost the game? And there’s a lot of people in here, but did you see outside? You’re very lucky to be here. Say, “Thank you very much for this wonderful journey, President.” No, you have to see, you have to see, there are tens of thousands of people in the streets out here trying to get in. I think the next time we’ll get a larger field. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Yeah, that’s nice. That’s really nice. Thank you. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. And by the way, we got Pac-12 back. You don’t care about Pac-12, but we got Pac-12. We said, “We might as well do out there too.” Right? And we did a double header. 10 days from now, we’re going to win this great state. And we are going to win four more years in the White House. You remember last time about this state, remember they said… For a year, I had to hear it. You cannot win unless you win the great state of Ohio. I heard it so many times. That was these fake people. Look at all of them over there, all those cameras. Look at all those lights that are on, all those lights that are on. But do you remember that? They would drum it. For a year, I heard, “You cannot win unless you win Ohio.” And then I got a poll and it said we’re doing pretty well in Ohio, by the way. Right? And then we won. Remember they said, “It’s going to be close. It’s going to be hard to win, going to be very, very hard. And Trump, if he doesn’t win Ohio, he’s out.” And then we not only won Ohio, we won Ohio by more than eight points, eight points. And they said, you know the story when it closes, I mean, they do a fast little count if you’re winning big. They said, “The polls in Ohio have closed. Donald Trump has won the state of Ohio.” It was like immediate. It was like in the same sentence. “The polls have closed. Trump has won.” Normally, it would take like hours and whatever if it’s close. No, we won big. And I hear we’re winning big now. And I’m hearing they gave up on the state already. And they’re going to give up on Florida very soon because we’re winning big in Florida, we’re winning big in North Carolina. You don’t want Sleepy Joe to be your president. He draws flies. He’s not drawing anybody. And Obama was there. They called in Obama. They said, “Sir, sir,” this was a few days ago, “Sir, I have bad news.” “What?” “President Obama is going to campaign for Sleepy Joe.” And I said, “Is that good news or bad news?” It’s true. And he said, “Well, he’s going to campaign.” So I guess it started yesterday, the day before, right? They had 42 people show up, 42. We have thousands, tens of thousands, and outside is five times what this is. No, there’s something going on. It happened last time four years ago, this time more. This time more. It happened last time. There was an enthusiasm four years ago, the likes of which the fake news has never seen before. Right? And I’ll have to tell you, and maybe I’ll be wrong, but at least to this point, the enthusiasm is much more, because you know what we’ve all done together? We’ve done a lot. We’ve done it. We’ve done a lot. It’s much more. It’s much more. We got all those tax cuts. We got all the regulation cuts. We got the steel guys back. We put tariffs on all the crap that they were dumping from China, 25%. They were dumping the steel. Then we said, “You can’t do that.” And lots of other things, we’ve done a lot, but it’s far greater today. Look at this field, I mean, as far as the eye can see, it’s far greater today than it was four years ago. And this is the most important election. This is the most important election of your lifetimes. I see a lot of young people up here. So big deal. Like what? 12 years. No. Big deal, right? It’s really the most… It could be the most important election we’ve ever had. I really believe that too. And I didn’t think I’d be saying it because our last win was such a big win, we’ve done so much. Nobody’s done more than what we’ve done. They don’t even question it when I say it, because they like to always, “Oh, he did this, he said that, he said…” They don’t even question. We have done more in the first three and a half years than any administration has done. It’s true. When you look at everything. And it’s an honor, but this is the most important election. I didn’t think I would say it because I viewed the last, what we did four years ago… Can you believe four years ago? Almost. Can you imagine that? Time flies. I’ll never forget the first night in the White House, they said… It’s like a surreal experience to have Abraham Lincoln’s bedroom here. I was talking to the First Lady. I said, “Do you believe this?” Took a little while, it takes a while to get used to it. And then, you know what you have to do? You have to get down to work. You get down to work. And that’s what we did. At the debate this week… Did anybody see the debate? Maybe? Couple of them maybe. But that had a lot. That was like a Super Bowl deal, I guess, with the ratings. That’s okay. We had one poll 91 to nine, it was, 91. With us having the 91. Okay? Yeah. I kept saying, “Hey, Joe, Joe, you want to do all this stuff? Why didn’t you do it? You were there three and a half years ago. Do it. Why didn’t you do it, Joe? You didn’t do much, Joe.” Then I said, “I wouldn’t have run, Joe. I wouldn’t have run if you did a good job. If you two did a good job, I wouldn’t have run. I didn’t need this, Joe. I had a very good life, Joe. I didn’t need this, Joe. I had a good life. I had a very nice life, Joe, but I wouldn’t have run. You did a good job, I wouldn’t have run. And if I did, I wouldn’t have won because you would have done a good job. There would have been no reason. The fact is you didn’t do a good job, Joe. You let us down, Joe.” And he had no idea what I was talking about. He had no clue. But at the debate this week, the American people saw the contrast between a 47-year career politician who used his public office to enrich himself. You know that. I mean, his son was like a human vacuum cleaner. He just follows. “Let’s go to China this week, Dad.” “Okay, son. Here, take out a billion and a half.” You get all the fees in a billion and a half. “How about going to Ukraine? Now, they’ll me 183,000 a month for my great, great services on energy.” ” What do you know about energy, son? I didn’t know…” “I don’t know anything, Dad, but I’ll learn. I’m willing to learn.” For the last half century, Joe Biden has been outsourcing your jobs, opening your borders and sacrificing American blood and treasure in these endless, ridiculous foreign wars. Countries you’ve never even heard of for the most part. I fight for the middle-class. I fight for everyone. I fight for this country. And Biden doesn’t know who he’s fighting for. Now you have to say, this is serious stuff. It is. It is serious stuff, but is there any place better to be than a Trump rally? I mean, seriously, right? I mean, it’s serious, but we have fun. And you know the best way to succeed? You got to love what you’re doing. And we all love it. And we love our country. We love our country. In 2016, Ohio voted to fire this depraved political establishment. And you elected an outsider as your president, who is finally putting America first. That’s what I’m doing. You work hard, you raise your families, you follow our laws, you support your church, that you’re not even allowed to go to. How about that? You can’t go to your church, but you can have a riot down Fifth Avenue. Isn’t that nice? You serve your community, and you give your love and loyalty to our great country. Now, you finally have a president that is loyal to you. Totally loyal to you. Believe me. There are easier ways to spend my life. This was… Nobody told me the swamp was going to be that deep and that vicious. They even impeached me over a perfect phone call. “Hello? How are you doing? Congratulations. Congratulations on your win, Mr. President of Ukraine.” “We’re going to impeach him.” These people are crazy. These people… Oh, now they’re doing it again. The laptop from hell. They found the laptop from hell. This is a laptop that they don’t want to see. How the hell this laptop got freed up, it’s amazing the way God works. The laptop from hell. Right? And now it comes. It’s Adam Shifty Schiff. Yesterday, I saw it for the first time, watermelon. He’s shaped like a watermelon. Adam Schiff, dishonest guy, totally dishonest guy. Made up my conversation. Remember in the halls of Congress, said, “Quid pro quo” eight times. I didn’t say it at all. Isn’t it lucky I had a transcriber? Isn’t it lucky? Otherwise, it would be my word against Shifty Schiff. But think of it, think of it. So Adam Schiff, he’s out there and he’s talking about what’s taken place, and here it is the laptop from hell. He said, “It’s Russia, Russia.” Here we go again. Russia, Russia, Russia. I think Russia must look at us, they say, “These people are stone cold crazy.” This is Russian disinformation. I’ll tell you what, we got to get back to business. This is crazy what’s going on. This is crazy. Russia. I heard it yesterday they got them caught… I think Biden… Didn’t he say at the debate, he said, “Well, this was Russian disinformation.” This is a disaster for them. But let’s see what happens. But see, but we have learned a lot. We’ve learned how corrupt the media is. I already knew they were corrupt. But they don’t want to write anything about it. So listen, so we caught them cold, just like we caught them spying on my campaign. We caught them doing horrible treasonous things. These were treasonous things. Let’s see what happens. Should have gone much faster, I have to be honest with you, but we caught them spying on our campaign, the whole group. And by the way, Obama and Biden, they knew everything about it. They knew everything about it. We caught them with that too. It’s much better if I say, “No, no, no, please.” No, it’s terrible. It’s a terrible thing. Now they’re trying to do it again where they get caught. And they’re trying to say it was Russia. They never say China. You know why? A lot of money comes out of China into their pockets. Do you ever notice? China has not been very good. We did a great trade deal, unbelievable. Two weeks ago, the largest order of corn, the largest order of soybeans, the largest. Yeah. Yeah. Except I feel different. Normally, I would have been here talking about the great trade. But you know what? The ink on the trade deal wasn’t dry. And then all of a sudden, the plague came in from China. That’s more important than trade deals. That’s more important. So it’s no good. With your vote, we will continue to bring back your jobs, lower drug prices at a level that nobody’s ever lowered them before and you… Last year for the first time ever, drug prices went down, but we’re doing what’s called a favored nations clause. The drug companies are not happy with me. This is not supposed to have happened. Favored nations means you’ll pay the lowest price anywhere in the world. You match. Its favored nations, and nobody’s exercised it, because nobody thought of it, probably. But if they did think of it, they couldn’t have done it because the drug companies are so powerful. They are taking… You see all the ads against me? It’s not so much Sleepy Joe. It’s the drug companies because I’ve exercised the favored nations. So if Germany or another country pays 25 cents for a pill, the exact pill, and we pay $2.50. And you’re talking about stuff like that, these are the kinds of differences. We pay for all research and development, everything. So if Germany’s at 10 or somebody, and we’re at much higher, we now pay 10. It’s very simple. It’s called favored nations. We pay the lowest in the world. Your prices could come down 50, 60, 70, 80%. They’ll come down a lot. And I have never had more ads spent because they have unlimited money. So big pharma they call it, right? It’s the number one power in Washington, and I’ve just learned they’re the number one power. And I knew this was going to happen. I said, “I don’t care. I’m put here to do a job. I’m put here to do a job.” They have the middlemen. The drug pricing’s very complicated. It’s very complicated stuff. They have it set so that it’s almost impossible to disengage it. And they have middlemen. You know the middlemen? Nobody ever heard… They never say middlewomen. I’ve never heard middlewomen. I want to be nice. I want to say middlewomen, but I’ve never heard the term, having to do with drug prices. But the middleman gets millions, gets more than the drug companies. At least the drug companies make the drugs, right? These people don’t do anything. They’re very rich. I probably know some of them. I would be not surprised if Hunter Biden was also a middleman. He probably got… On top of everything else, takes in millions and millions. And now we find out that Hunter Biden is a middleman, but these are rich people and they get all this money for nothing. So I worked a deal where Canada, which buys their drugs for exactly 50%, I’m going to let our governors, your governor, governor of Florida, other governors buy their drugs directly from Canada. Nobody’s ever done… Same drug, exactly the same, same lab, same company, same everything. And they’re going to buy it for 50% less. And then by that time, the favored nations will kick in, and you’ll get it for even less. So this has never happened before, but it’s happening. We will support our great police, protect your Second Amendment, defend your borders, and ensure more products are proudly stamped with that beautiful… Isn’t it a beautiful phrase? You didn’t hear it for a long time until Trump came along, made in the USA, made in the USA. You didn’t hear it for a long time, right? Been a long time. When I was young, they used to say made in America, made in… Every car, made in… Now you don’t see it anymore. We’re going to see it. Remember, I was saying today, I was in North Carolina, speaking to a great crowd, and I said, “Remember, when I first started, I said, ‘We’re going to say Merry Christmas again.'” You remember? And remember, all the department stores, many of them are wiped out because of the internet, but these are minor details, right? But all the department stores, they’d say, “Happy new year” and everything but Christmas, they don’t want to say Christmas. I said, “We’re going to say Christmas again.” And you know what? They’re all saying Christmas again. They’re saying, “Merry Christmas.” They’re all saying, “Merry Christmas” again. Going to be there pretty soon. And we have a big day, better get out November 3rd, big, big, big. Who’s voted already? Who’s voted? I just voted. I just voted. Get out and vote. No, this is the biggest election that, I really believe, maybe we’ve ever had, because the radical left has gone crazy. And you know what, when we win this one, I think they’re going to rest. I really do. I think they’re going to say, “Okay, that’s enough. That’s enough.” She goes, “No, they won’t.” You’re probably right. But you know what brings it together? Success. And we’re doing a super V, we’re going up. You see housing starts, and the numbers, the automobile starts, nobody’s ever seen anything like it. The numbers for some things are better than they were pre this plague that came in, the pandemic. I mean, it’s amazing, actually amazing. We have a super V. You’re going to see a number that’s going to be announced just prior to the election, GDP. It was just estimated by the Fed to be 35%. I think the highest we’ve ever had was like seven. Now, who knows if they’re right, maybe they’re… I’ll take 25 right now. Okay? Problem is, I mentioned 35. So if it’s 25, you know what they’ll do? “It was a terrible, terrible upset for the president.” Whatever the… If it was 15, I’d be happy. They just estimated. They think it might be 35%. That’s unheard of. We’re coming back because we built… You know why though? Because we built a strong foundation. We had a strong foundation. If we didn’t, this country would be some mess. And if a guy like Biden gets in, where he wants to raise your taxes, quadrupled. And he wants to put all those ridiculous regulations that… Used to take 20 years to get approval for a highway. Now we got it down to two years, and I’m trying to get it down to one. I think we can, and it might not get built for safety reasons or environmental reasons, but we have it down to a very, very short period of time. It used to take… We have roads 21, 22 years, and then it would get disapproved. They would then raise their hands, not to approve it after 20 years. Now those days are over, but he would put everything back. He’s going to raise your taxes like crazy. I’ve never seen anyone. You know, all my life I’ve been involved indirectly. Usually on the other side, only exclusively. I’ve never seen raising taxes. I’ve seen politicians. “We will lower your tax.” This is the first politician that’s ever running saying, he’s going to quadruple your taxes. What the hell? This the craziest thing I’ve ever seen. I’m looking up. I’m saying, “Is this really like… Is this serious?” First of all, I look at him and I say, “Am I running against this man? I’m running against sleepy Joe.” In primetime, he wasn’t good. Now I’m running against him. This is not prime time. Did you think he did well in the debate the other night? The last question was the best though, right? Because he lied about fracking. He kept going. During the primaries, “There will be no fracking. There will be no fracking.” By the way, you’re a big fracking state. You better hope that he didn’t… You’ve only got about a million. You’ve only got about a million jobs. More importantly than the jobs is you got the lowest energy prices we’ve had. How about your $2 gasoline and less? Right? You wouldn’t mind if it went to nine, $10, $12. You couldn’t get it. Well, they wouldn’t mind because they’d like you to get rid of all your cars. No more airplanes, no more cars, no more cows. You know, cows. I think they took that off the manifesto, right? It was too much, but they would like it. They would like it. No, what we’re doing has been incredible. You can’t have your tax increased. So I’m cutting taxes. We’re doing another big tax cut. That’s what brought everything in. Billions and billions of dollars has come into our country because of what we’ve done. What? You’re going to just chase it all out? These are people without a lot of heart. They go where they make the deal. We brought it down. We brought the middle income taxes down. Child tax credit, $1,000 a child. He said he wants to get rid of it. Okay? He wants to get rid of it. Why does he want to get rid of it? That could only take place in the great state of Ohio. And I worked here for a couple of summers in Cincinnati. I like Cincinnati. I like Ohio. Worked out well. It was a good success. And you know, it’s like, when something works out well, you like it. I was very young. A job in Cincinnati, Swifton Village, had anybody ever hear Swifton? Anyway. And we bought it and we sold it and it worked out nice. And you know, you always have like a good feeling, but I have an even better feeling because of what happened four years ago with Ohio. Even better feeling. And it’s going to happen again. But it’s the first time I’ve ever seen a politician say, “We will raise your taxes.” I’m saying, “Wait a minute. Did he say… ” No seriously. Have you ever heard a politician campaigning going, “I’m going to raise your taxes. And I’m going to put a lot more regulations. But a lot of people don’t know.” You know, I think the regulation cuts we did was actually more important. Maybe not for everybody, but for the business people. And then they hire and jobs all over the place. We had 160 million people working. We’ve never been anywhere close to that number. We’re going to be back very soon, 11.4 million people hired over the year, which was a record. But I think the regulation cuts might’ve been even more important. This election is a choice between a Trump super recovery and a Biden, in my opinion, this is going to happen. I hate to say it. Depression. You’re going to have a depression. And you have 401(k)s. Does anybody have a 401(k)? Throw them away. They’re not going to be worth. It’s a choice between a boom and a lockdown. Did you hear him during the debate? Right? He said, “I’d lock it down, oh yes. I’d… ” No, no. We’re not locking it down. No, no. We’re not. We’ve learned the disease. We did the right thing. We saved millions of lives. We saved two million lives, maybe more than that. We locked it then we opened. But we understand it. Like young people, Barron. He had it. The doctor said… you know, Barron very, very tall young man and a great guy. Right. But he’s young. And the doctor said, “Sir, Barron has tested positive.” I said, “That’s terrible. Barron didn’t even know he was.” He said… Next day the doctor comes in, “Sir, Barron’s fine.” Because they’re young like these guys over here. They’re young because they have strong immune systems. Right? They’re strong. They have these strong, beautiful immune systems. So it was good. I happened to test. Right? You know why? I couldn’t stay in a basement. I’d meet a lot of people. I’m President. I have to get out. I have to get out. No, it’s true. I’d have meetings where I’d go back and say, “You know, that’s got to be dangerous. That’s got to be this or that.” But the fact is I had it. It worked out well. Now I’m immune. I could run up and kiss this whole group of people, men and women. It worked out. By the way, 99.9% is good and then you’re immune and all that stuff. I heard you were immune for life. So when I had it, I said, “I’m immune.” To them, to the fake news. And they said, “But only for four months.” I heard it was for life. With me it was for four months. If it was anybody else they’d say for life. But anyway, no, I had it. First Lady had it. Right. And you get better. We got better. They love the First Lady. Very elegant. Most elegant First Lady. No, it’s amazing. It’s amazing. They don’t treat her very nicely and she’s incredible. The most elegant woman. And she goes, “But that is okay.” She loves the people. I mean, it’s really amazing. Yeah. She’s done a great job and she loves it and she loves the people, but she had it recovered. I had it recovered. Barron had it ,didn’t even know he had it. So it’s one of those things, but we have to lead your life. So when I would be having meetings with Gold Star families, military, lots of other people. I’d have meetings. Right. And I go and I do the meeting and sometimes people would come up and they get close and everything else, mask, no mask. They get close. And at least some of these meetings say, “That could be dangerous. I guess. I don’t know.” But I have to do my job. As I said at the debate, I can’t put myself in the basement of the White House for a year and a half. I can’t do it till this thing goes away. And it is going away. It’s rounding the term. Do you notice they talk about cases, always cases, cases, cases. They don’t talk about the mortality rate down 85%. Because what we have is so incredible, the job we’ve done is so incredible. 85%. Think of that. 85%, but they do it. And you know what? On November 4th, you’re not going to hear the news. The CNN, all they talk about. COVID COVID COVID COVID. If a plane goes down with 500 people, they don’t talk about it. All that talk because they’re trying to scare everybody. You have to lead your life and you have to get out. You have to be vigilant. Be careful, socially distance, get too close. Put the mask on, put it on, get on lots of different things. But really I see what they’re doing. It’s just like they try to hide all of this corruption from the Biden family, by not putting it. They refuse to write it. And I have to give the New York Post, my hometown paper, the New York Post, the oldest newspaper in the country, the fourth largest. I have to give them credit because they went against the grain, and they’re willing to expose all of this corruption. And then you see Big Tech. They won’t put it on. And if you put it on, they delete you. They terminate you. Charlie Kirk, break up Big Tech. Well, they did sue [inaudible 00:08:50], nothing to do with this, of course. But they did sue Google on Thursday. Right? You like it? No, terrible. No, no, but they’ve exposed themselves because nobody knew it was that serious. They won’t put it on. And if you put it on, if you put something on from the New York… I think they… Didn’t they delete the New York Post? They terminated out the New York Post. Can you imagine a newspaper? They won’t put it on. People have learned, they don’t want anything because if Biden got in, they would own the world. If Biden got in, China would own our country. I mean, China. Did you see where the kid was trying to get $10 million a year for introduction purposes? Okay. This was all down in the paper. They say, “Russia did it.” This was all down in a paper. Now confirmed by the guy that ran the company. He’s not… I would say they’re not too happy with him. Wouldn’t you say? I saw him the other day, but it’s all right stuff. I mean, what he’s saying is right. He couldn’t take it anymore. He couldn’t stand the corruption. So let’s see. But can you imagine when people say, “Don’t print it.” In other words, you’ll never hear it, but you know, it ended up backfiring. Because that happened, it’s become a much bigger story. Because you add it all up, it’s actually become… If they would have printed it, who knows what would have happened? You forget it? Something… But it’s become a much bigger… Big Tech, section 230, right? Big Tech is corrupt. The media, the fake news is corrupt. And I’ve been saying it for a long time. Even I didn’t know that you were that corrupt, but look at all of them. Even I didn’t know that you were that corrupt. In the meantime, you watch the television sets go off. Let’s cut. Cut this guy off. Cut the President off. Can you imagine they’re broadcasting this stuff and now they’re saying, “Cut him off,” but it’s okay. I don’t mind because I like telling the truth. Biden and the Democrats will offshore your jobs. Dismantle your police departments, dissolve your borders, confiscate your guns. Second Amendment. They’re after it. Eliminate your private health care. You know, we have 180 million people with private health care. A lot of you have private health care. It’s what you dream of. It’s great. You negotiate. You have many great companies doing it. They compete. You have great private health care. They want to terminate it. They want to terminate your religious liberty. They want to destroy the suburbs. I am the best thing that ever happened to the suburbs. You know, they were talking about this… 60 Minutes. She asked me a question. You saw that I printed out the whole interview. I said, “Put it down.” But she said to me a question, one of her questions, she said, “Why are you begging? Why? Suburban women? You said, “Please love me suburban women, please, please, love me, please. I beg you. Please love me suburban.”” No, I didn’t say that. What I did is I said, “Love me suburban women,” because I saved the suburbs. They had a regulation. They had a regulation that would have brought low-income housing projects and crime right to their doorstep. Would have been right next to it. And I said, “Suburban women, you’re going to love me.” That’s what I said. And I was being sarcastic. They said, “Why are you begging for the love of suburban… ” Suburban women are going to love me. You know why? Because they want security. They want safety and they don’t want a regulation that’s going to destroy suburbia. That’s all. That’s all. Because they said, “He’s not doing well with suburban women.” I said, “What about suburban men? How am I doing?” “Well there, you’re doing okay. You’re doing well with the men. Not the women.” But Biden has vowed to abolish fracking, right? He says, “We’re going to not frack anymore.” He has no idea what it means. We are not no fossil fuels, no nothing. We’re going to close down all our factories. We’re going to go with wind. Wind. Wind is going to be the answer. Kills all our birds, everything else. We’re going to have massive blackouts like they have in California, the whole country. You ever see the brownouts? Crippling power outages. 700,000 Ohio jobs would be destroyed. Biden lies about a lot of things. He lied about that. He lied about social security. You saw that, social security. He also won’t tell you the truth about decades long quest. He had a decades long quest to renegotiate social security and Medicare. And he said he didn’t do it. We have a tape here someplace. Do we have the tape? I hope it works better than the big 10 tape. Okay. Play both videos. So we have one real quick. We have… I only do this you. You said it in the tape. I’ll put it on. Turn it up. Okay. So there he said, “No, fracking.” Social security. We’re starting to use this very expensive means of communication because it’s so much easier than my explaining it. So number one, he said, “There’ll be no fracking, no fracking, no fracking.” He luckily gets a nomination because Elizabeth Warren stayed in for an extra three days, right? If she would have left before Super Tuesday, he wouldn’t have won one state. He would have been out. And then I would have been competing against crazy Bernie instead, which is okay. I don’t care. Well, there would’ve been more energy. I mean, there would have been a lot more… No Bernie has more energy, smaller little face maybe, but have a lot of energy. They’re coming to us because a lot of them, they agree with me so much on trade. We got a lot of them last time. But anyway, so no fracking. Then he goes to Pennsylvania, great place. And he says, “Yeah, you’re going to have fracking. A million jobs.” They want to keep their bills down. Right? The lighting bills and the gasoline. So all of a sudden he goes from no fracking to, “We will frack.” And everyone said, “How the hell?” And the fake news doesn’t call him out on it. They don’t even talk to him about it. So I bring it up because that’s good. It’s expensive to do, but you know what? It’s worth it for the great state of Ohio. Right. Then we hear about Medicare and social security. So all my life I’ve heard, if you even touch social security, you’re out of politics. This guy tried to destroy social security and Medicare and Bernie caught him. I’d like to thank Bernie very much. You know, Bernie is honestly, he’s a good sport. He’s one of the greatest losers in the history of politics, seriously. He lost viciously with Hillary and possibly shouldn’t. I mean, I think she sort of beat him, but he was treated very badly. And then this time he should’ve won, except that she said… I mean, what they did, they quadruple teamed him. And what they did to him was incredible. And he’s got no hard feelings. You know, he just goes back. Bernie is the loser. I mean, I’ve never seen a guy like this. He loves to lose. Some people love to lose. Some people. As long as I’m your President, I will always protect Medicare and social security like I promised. And he won’t and he won’t, and America will continue to be the number one producer of oil and natural gas, anywhere in the world. You don’t have to worry about me with your Ohio fracking. You frack till your heart’s content. By the way, and it’s not up to him just so you understand, it’s not up to him. He switched, but this party is not going to let him frack, okay. They’re not going to let him frack. And he’s got no… And he’s probably not going to be in there too long anyway. They’ve got the dream. They’ve got this Kamala who is the most liberal person. And she said, “There will never be fracking.” Now she’s saying, “Well, I think we can live with it. Yeah.” No, no, no. Go with what they say first. In politics, go with what they say. That’s where they come from. And they don’t have a choice. She doesn’t either. There’s not going to be fracking if they win. There’s going to be a lot of bad things happening. Like socialized medicine, like a lot of bad things are going to happen. Joe Biden has made a corrupt bargain in exchange for his party’s nomination. He has handed control of his party over to the socialists. I hate to say this, the communists, the Marxists and the left wing extremists that you see running up and down the street. And the left wing extremists that you see running up and down the street doing tremendous damage in Portland and various places that we could stop. And Antifa. You’re right, Antifa. I said, “Joe, tell us about Antifa, Joe.” “Oh, that’s just an idea.” Really? When you get hit over the head with a baseball bat, that’s not an idea. No, he doesn’t want to talk about Antifa. I said, “Joe I’ve been endorsed by almost every law enforcement group in the country, almost everyone, sheriffs, police. New York City’s finest, they’ve taken all of that great vim and that enthusiasm. What they’ve done in New York is terrible. All run by Democrats, all run by radical left Democrats or even Democrats. You look at what’s happened to New York crime-wise, you look at what happened to Chicago. Look at Portland, look at Portland. Look at Oakland, look at Baltimore. By the way, Obama talks like his administration. He had stuff. How about Baltimore? How about Oakland? How about Ferguson? How about St. Louis? What he had. And it’s like I said, that’s why I’m here. I’m here because people were not happy. They’re running a slate of the most radical candidates in American history. They are running the most radical people, AOC plus three, AOC. How about AOC? How about in Minnesota, beautiful Minnesota? Omar, Ilhan Omar. And she’s always complaining about the way we run our country. I think we’re going to win. Minnesota hasn’t been won by a Republican since 1972. Does anybody know that? I think we’re going to win Minnesota. First of all, we did a very good job with Minneapolis. That National Guard went in. We have to get a call. We’re not allowed to send them in unless we want to do something much tougher than that, which you don’t want to do. But we have to get a call. So we get a call, but the National Guard went in. In a half an hour, the whole was … To me, it was a beautiful sight. Boom, boom. To me, it was a beautiful sight. They lined up and they just started walking and that was the end of that. They should have been called a week and a half earlier. They could have saved a lot of people and a lot of buildings and a lot of area. If Biden wins, the flag burning rioters on the streets will be running your federal government. I signed into law, when the statues were coming down, our monuments, and at first they were monuments of people we never heard of, and I said, “You know what? You let them get away, they’ll be wanting to take down monuments of George Washington.” Everyone laughed. They thought it was funny. I said, “I’m not kidding.” And they did. If I weren’t president, you would have monuments taken down all over the city of Lincoln, of Washington, of Jefferson. They were going for the Jefferson Memorial. Can you believe this? And we have a mayor in D.C. who formed a commission with recommendations. Her recommendation is take down the Washington Monument, close up the Lincoln Monument. No, no, these are serious. You read about it. I said, “No, thank you. No, thank you. No, thank you, Madam Mayor. We’re going to keep the Washington Monument just the way it is.” These people. These people are crazy. I went to Mount Rushmore, made a speech. I don’t know if you saw my speech, but people liked my Mount Rushmore. But you know why they liked it? Because it was so beautiful. And behind me this mountain is carved so beautifully. It’s beautiful. South Dakota, beautiful. And I’m making a speech, and then I realized they want to take down Mount Rushmore. No, it’s not happening. By the way, don’t tell that to the people of South Dakota. So when I saw the thing with the statues and with the monuments all over the country, I said, “We need a strong, strong law. Not with this Congress we have now, where one day would be too much.” And we took out an old law and it says 10 years in prison if you knock down a monument. And I reenacted it, I signed it. And they were coming in Washington. They wanted to knock down quite a few of our beautiful monuments, including one of Abraham Lincoln, and you remember Jackson, they had the ropes. But the police went in, did a great job. They did a phenomenal job. They went in, these police, they went in. They were unbelievable. It’s true. Remember they had the ropes, they were ready. They were starting to pull it. And they’re pretty rough guys, but the police went in and they’re much rougher. It was over so fast. It was over so fast. Andrew Jackson, who was a great general and a good president, maybe a very good president, take it down. Andrew Jackson, a great battle of New Orleans, a great general and a very good president. Beautiful, right opposite the White House. They wanted to pull it down. They were ready, and the police went in and the police did a great job. They did a great job. But I said, “We need something.” So we signed something that says 10 years. And you know, they were going to march the following day. They were going to have thousands of people come to rip down statues in Washington. And we informed them, “It’s 10 years in jail, 10 years in prison.” They actually used the term prison because it’s a tougher term, right? It’s in prison. Today they don’t use that term today. They use much nicer terms. It says 10 years in prison if you knock down a monument, do anything to damage a monument or a statue. So what happened is they heard about it, and they came in. There were only 24 people. It was supposed to be tens of thousands. 24 people, and they looked around and the 24 people said, “Let’s get the hell out of here.” And that was the end. That was the end of it. It’s amazing. It’s amazing what the pen can do, right? The pen. But you couldn’t go to Congress today and get that because they don’t think this way. Today they don’t think. Today they say, “What? It’s freedom of speech, knocking down a statue, it’s freedom of speech. You can let them do whatever they want to do.” Can’t do that. Can’t do that. So the federal government’s been doing a great job. Now the state governments have to get tougher, and the state governments have to call in the federal government when they have a problem. It’s very simple. The mayor is right. They could use some help. The first thing they’ll do if they win this office, and I don’t think it’s going to happen based on everything I’m seeing, is they’re going to pack the Supreme Court with far left judges who will eliminate your Second Amendment. And if you happen to be pro-life, you can forget that. You can forget that. They will change everything. They will change it. We took our time. I have three Supreme Court justices. We have a great one coming, a great one coming. Three great ones. Many presidents have had none. Think of it. And me, their worst nightmare, has three. Their heads are exploding. No, but just of equal importance in my opinion, by the end of my first term, we’ll have 300, give or take a little bit, 300 federal judges, including court of appeal, 300. A record, it’s a record. No, it’s a record. So think of that. 300 federal judges, I think, close to 60 court of appeals judges, and three Supreme Court justices. I mean, can you believe it? Even I can’t believe it. Even I. It’s a record. If I don’t sound like a typical Washington politician, it’s because I’m not a politician. And if I don’t always play by the rules of the Washington establishment, it’s because I was elected to fight for you and I am fighting for you harder than any president has ever fought. So we’re joined today by a couple of our good friends, state auditor Keith Faber. Where is Keith? Keith. Good job, Keith. Thank you. So Keith has done great job and thank you very much for being here. We appreciate it. That cheering was for you, Keith, I think. Was that for Keith? State supreme court justices, Judy French and Sharon Kennedy. Thank you very much. Congratulations. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you, Judge. And a person that right at the beginning, she was with us. She was right there and she’s fantastic, GOP chairwoman, Jane Timken. Great, Jane. How are we doing, Jane? How does it compare to four years ago? She goes more so. Even more enthusiasm. I mean, it’s true. They’re going to find out on November 3rd. It’s going to say, ” Oh.” Remember four years ago that evening? Was that one of the greatest evenings? They said, “This will be a very, very short evening for Donald Trump.” Then they say, “Donald Trump has won the state of Florida.” “Whoa, what’s that all about?” “Donald Trump has won the state of Ohio.” “What the hell is going on?” “Donald Trump has won.” They had North Carolina. They said that’s their stopgap, that’s the one. “Donald Trump has just won the state of North Carolina.” Then, Georgia and South Carolina, and we just swept that whole place. And then we came in with Michigan, hadn’t been won in decades and decades. And we came in with Wisconsin, hadn’t been won in a long time. And it was one of the most beautiful evenings, wasn’t it? And then they talk about, “If you lose, will this be a friendly transition?” And I said, “Let me ask you a question. When I won, did they give me a friendly transition?” They spied on my campaign. They did all this stuff. That was not a friendly transition was that, huh? I also want to recognize Pickaway County commissioner and Ohio State football legend, oh, Champ Henson. Where the hell is he? Whoa, good looking guy. You look like you could play tomorrow, Champ. Boy. He’s a hell of an athlete. Jeff. Great. That’s great. Champ led the nation in scoring when he played for the great Woody Hayes at Ohio State. Right? Great. It looks good. Handsome guy. Woody Hayes was easy to play for, wasn’t he? He was a nice guy. He goes, “No, he wasn’t.” That’s okay. He was great though, wasn’t he, huh? You know what? He got it done, right? He got it done. Great. Nice to see you, Champ. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. For decades, our politicians spent trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations, right? They would spend money on these foreign nations that didn’t give a damn for us, fighting foreign wars and defending foreign borders. But now we are finally protecting our nation. We are rebuilding our cities and we are bringing our jobs, our factories, and our troops back home to the U.S.A. Our troops are all coming back. Got to fight the deep state all the time. No, but our troops are all coming back. Afghanistan, 19 years, would you say that’s enough? And we’re policemen over there. We’re police. We’re were policemen over there. Under my administration, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world. And now very simply, we are doing it again. We built it. We had to close it down, unbelievably. I couldn’t believe it when they came to my office. And we had to close it down. We did the right thing. We saved all those lives. Now we’re reopening it. And we’re doing it at a level that nobody’s ever seen before. In my first three years, we increased family income. You know, it’s called Make America Great Again, right, like the hat. Make America Great Again. But now I say, Make America Great Again Again, Make America Great Again Again. We increased family income over $6,000, more than five times the gains in all eight years. So we did it in three years under the past administration. Think of that, five times more. African American unemployment, Hispanic American unemployment, and Asian American unemployment all reached their lowest levels in the history of our country. All unemployment. I mean, I’ve seen so many forms of unemployment, with a high school diploma, without a high school diploma, an MBA, a college degree, graduating number one at MIT, everybody was doing better. Women doing unbelievably, unbelievable, breaking every record. But we had to slow it down, close it up, save those lives. Understand this horrible virus that was sent to us by China, but sent to the whole world, sent to the whole world. They stopped it from going into other parts of China, but it came to the U.S. and Europe and all over the world, and we can never forget it. We can never forget it. After the virus hit, we’ve recovered faster than any major nation on earth. We’ve recovered faster economically since April. Since April, we created a record 11.4 million jobs. This week, I signed an order to protect the pensions of workers of Delphi Corporation. Do we have any of those workers here? You are so lucky I’m president. There’s two people here. You are so lucky that I’m president. But when General Motors went bankrupt, Biden and Obama threw these workers really to the wolves. Their pensions were totally wiped out. Their families were left in disarray. It was a terrible thing. So my order is the first step to restoring the pensions and healthcare benefits promised to workers in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Ohio, and congratulations. No, they were treated very unfairly. And they were promised all sorts of things, and then as usual, nothing happened. I will never let anyone rip off our great American worker. We’re not going to let them rip it off. And they have been doing that for a long time. Joe Biden says buy American, but he spent 47 years in Washington sending our jobs to foreign countries. And you’ll also notice he never says hire American. Did you ever notice that? That’s because his plan is to hire foreign workers. He wants open borders and he wants unlimited illegal aliens coming, and we don’t know who they are. So that leaves no jobs for the Americans, so we have that straight dole out. It’s all done. Don’t worry about it. Don’t get upset. In fact, he’s vowed to terminate all of the protections that I’ve given to the American worker. I’ve given you a lot of protections. To save our auto industry, I withdrew from the horrible Transpacific Partnership. It would have been the worst. I ended the NAFTA nightmare, one of the worst trade deals, probably the worst trade deal. Everyone said it would be impossible to do, and proudly signed the brand new USMCA into law, Mexico, Canada. And by the way, just kicked in. The difference is unbelievable. You know how I know it’s good? Because those two countries aren’t quite as happy as we are. But NAFTA was a disaster. We lost 60,000 factories went to different countries. It’s terrible. It was terrible. It was a terrible thing to have signed. And everybody said it would be impossible to terminate. I terminated it. And we have the USMCA, which is great, great for us. And it makes it very, very tough. And the wall is almost complete. He says, “Build the wall.” The press doesn’t talk about the wall anymore because it’s all built. Very soon, it’s going to be completed. And it has created such an unbelievable strong border. You have no idea. And Mexico also, Mexico’s given us 27,000, think of that, 27,000 soldiers to protect our border. I said, “You have to do it. You have to do it because it’s not right. And we don’t have people.” Remember when I came in? Remember the caravans coming in, they were coming in. Thousands and thousands of people were trying to come in. I said, “You can’t do it.” You don’t hear about any of these stories anymore. You don’t hear about the wall anymore. Used to be wall, wall, wall, because they never thought I’d get it built. Once you’re a developer in New York City, this is easy. No, we got it financed. Mexico will be paying for it because we’re going to charge a fee at the base. So it’s very simple. But they’ve been great. Mexico’s treated us very well. They didn’t use to treat us well, but now they treat us well. Joe Biden has vowed that he wants open borders, mass amnesty, and free healthcare for all illegal immigrants coming in. And that was another tape he had, right? They had 16, 17 of these super radical left people running on the Democrat side. That wasn’t so bad. I was waiting. I could hear that. That wasn’t that bad. That’s good because you got a lot of people watching you on television. But remember, they said, “Who is going to give healthcare to illegal immigrants coming into the country?” And they all raised their hands, everybody raised their hands except Joe, because he’s been doing it for 47 years. He knew it was not a good thing. So he did the shoulder. Remember? And then he got the hand up. I said, “Ah, I just won,” because you can’t do it. The problem is, look, we all have a heart, but if you do that, you’re going to have tens and millions of people pouring into our country for healthcare, for college, for school. They want to get free school, free education. They want to give, the new one, they want to give free lawyers to everybody that enters our country illegally. That’s down in the manifesto with Bernie. That’s between those two characters you saw up there, Bernie and Joe, Sleepy Joe. Bernie got taken further left. Can you believe it? Bernie is supposed to be taken to the right. He took Joe further left than anything he ever did. The manifesto we call it. Biden’s also pledged to terminate all national security travel bans. I got travel bans if it’s okay with you, because I did like people that want to come in and blow up our country. Okay. I got it passed. Wasn’t easy. That was not easy. That was a bad one. That was a tough one. They thought I was a bad person. No. I want people to come into our country who love our country, who can help us, not people that want to blow up things and kill people. But travel bans and increase, they want to increase refugees. This is an agreement with Bernie Sanders. Increase refugees, 700%, opening the flood gates to radical Islamic terrorism. No, thank you. No, thank you. We appreciate it, Joe. Thank you very much, but no thanks. I’m keeping the terrorist jihadist and violent extremists out of our country if that’s okay. We invested $2.5 trillion in the US military, including more than $6 billion in contracts. Oh, for Lima. You know, Lima, the army tank plant. Lima. I did that when I was here. That was going to close, that plant. I was President Elect. So I had nothing to do for a little while. There was a little time, I didn’t know I was being spied on. So I had nothing to do. And I heard about this tank plant and I had some friends, a lot of friends in Ohio. And they said about this tank plant that… Jim Jordan, the great Jim Jordan, who we love. He’s one of them. Jim Jordan was a great NCA wrestling champion, too. He was great. He was great. Jim Jordan is a great warrior I will tell you that. Nobody like him. But it’s true. Jim Jordan and others, they said, we have to save this plant. I said, let me take a look. So I actually went to Lima and I saw this plant. And it’s the only plant now that makes army tanks. And a level of sophistication, you wouldn’t believe it. And I went through, I’m good at this stuff. I went through the plant. I said, “If we ever close this plant, you’ll never be able to get the skill, the talent or a facility to do this.” I’m not going to buy our tanks from China. Okay. We were close to that in the steel world. Let’s buy our steel from China. No, thank you. You know, there are certain industries we have to have and we brought that back. So I said, “No, I’m not going to let this be closed.” And I stopped it. And we are making tanks at a record level, all made in the USA. We’re making it at a record level. And you’re right. Jim Jordan was very helpful. You would have never been able to replace that plant, this big, incredible sprawling place. And they make these tanks. They’re so sophisticated. You wouldn’t believe it when you see. I look inside. I said, “No, thanks. I don’t have to go inside. I don’t need that.” You know who tried that? Dukakis, that didn’t work out. I’m slightly larger than him. I might’ve had the opposite problem. But he didn’t look cool. That was not a good picture with him with a helmet. Does anybody remember? Dukakis? He was up 10. After that picture, he was down 15. He went down 20. No, I don’t have to go into the tank, but I did happen to look in and I said, “That’s like a complex machine. That’s incredible what you do. We can’t close this place. You’ll never be able to reproduce this.” And we didn’t close it. So it’s one of a lot of great decisions I think we’ve made for our military and for the people and also for the people of Ohio. And we took over 100% of the ISIS caliphate. You saw that, Syria and Iraq. And for years there were after this blood thirsty killer. They were after, they could never find him, but we found him. We killed the leader, founder of ISIS, al-Baghdadi, we killed him. And then we took out the mass murderer of American troops and many other people, Soleimani is dead. I withdrew from the last administration’s disastrous Iran, nuclear deal. One of the dumbest deals. And I recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem. And instead of never ending wars, you see we just signed yesterday another one, Sudan. So we have Bahrain, Sudan and the United Arab Emirates. Really led by a great leader, Muhammad, a great leader, and we’re getting peace without blood all over the sand. It’s going to happen. We have many other countries that want to come in. Many other countries want to come into that deal. We’ll have peace. I did more in 47 months than sleepy Joe Biden did in 47 years. That’s right. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, a limitless future for all Americans. Really it’s a vote for the American dream. That’s what it is. We’re for the American dream. I’m for the American dream. The Republicans will be with us. Then in conclusion, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. We’ve already started. We will end our reliance on China once and for all. That’s already happening. We will hire more police, increased penalties for assaults on law enforcement. And we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens and we will keep America out of the ridiculous, endless foreign wars if that’s okay. Keep them out. We’ve created the greatest military in the world. The equipment that we bought. 2.5 trillion, 2.5. That was much easier to get, frankly, and the Democrats didn’t want to give anything, but that was much easier to get, believe it or not than the wall. They didn’t want the wall. They said the wall is old fashioned. They wanted drones flying around so you could watch people pour into our border. Okay. And you know I’ve been saying it a lot because it’s true. There are two things that will never get obsolete, a wall and a wheel. Right? I said the wall and that wall is that just has stopped them. But what we’ve done is we’ve created two and a half trillion with a T, trillion dollars. We have the greatest jet fighting planes, tankers, missiles, rockets, submarines. We have greatest weapon in the world, submarines greatest, most powerful weapons in the world. Our nuclear arsenal is fixed and ready and only hope to God we never have to use it, but you know what? We’re much less likely to have to use it because right now we have things. The hydrostatic missiles, I call them the super-duper missiles. They’ll go seven times the speed of a normal quick missile. I mean, these things are amazing. And you know, Russia took things that we had during the Obama Administration, from our great scientists and engineers. And they built, they have hydro sonic, but we have hydro sonic now that they’re fastest in the world. We needed all of this stuff. We have the greatest equipment. We are the envy of the world, whether it’s Russia, China, North Korea, we have the greatest equipment. We have the greatest people. We have the greatest warriors. But our warriors needed the equipment. And when I came into office in my first short period of time, one of the world’s most overrated generals told me, “Sir, we don’t have ammunition.” I said, “That should never be said to another president again.” And now we have so much ammunition, we don’t know what to do with it. So we have totally rebuilt our military. The finest equipment anywhere in the world, nothing even close, no other country has anything even close. The fake news was saying, “You shouldn’t be saying that, you’re giving confidential information.” That’s okay. I’ll say it. There’s nobody. Can you imagine that? They wanted to even call me on that. Maybe they should impeach me for making that statement. And we will ensure peace through strength. We will end surprise medical billing, require the biggest thing there is, price transparency. Remember I said it. Kicks in on January 1st. It’s bigger than healthcare. Wait till you see what you can do when you have transparency, where you can negotiate with your doctors, your hospitals, et cetera. Lower drug prices, as I said, favored nations. And even more, we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions, always. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. And we will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. And so importantly, we will live by the timeless words of our national motto In God We Trust. Amen. For years you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a President who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of Ohio. Thank you. Biden used to say that he’s made a lot of mistakes, because he was never sure where the hell he was. Right? So let’s say, like that line, maybe a lesser version of it. I’m standing up for the great people of Florida. No, they had no palm trees. Now he did that about seven times. Once you do that, walk off the stage, no matter how good a speech you give, it’s no good. You just walk off the stage. Standing up for the great people of Idaho. He had Iowa and Idaho and he couldn’t figure it out. This is not what we need. For the last four years. You have seen me fight for you. And now I am relying on you to deliver another historic victory for our country. Go through Ohio. Vote early, bring your friends, your families, your neighbors, your coworkers, get your boss to go. I don’t care. But you have to get out and vote. Everybody has to get out and vote. From Akron to Columbus, from Dayton to Cleveland, from Cincinnati to right here in Circleville, we stand on the shoulders of red blooded American patriots who poured out their heart, their sweat, their soul to secure our liberty and to defend our freedom. We inherit the legacy of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blazed the trails, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, laid down the railroads, dug out the Panama Canal, raised up the great skyscrapers, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And the best is yet to come. Best is yet to come. Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. That’s what this has all been about. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of Ohio, we have made America powerful again, military. We have made America wealthy again, stock market. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again. We have made America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, Ohio. Go out and vote. Thank you.

"96","10-25-20","Thank you very much. Thank you. What a group. What a group. We love this place. This was my first victory, right? This was our first victory. Remember that beautiful primary that we had and Trump came in and Trump won this incredible great state and it was off to the races, right? Off to the races. So I want to thank you and hello, New Hampshire. It’s great to be with you on this beautiful, on this beautiful day. Nine days from now, we are going to win the state. Can you believe it? Nine days. And we’re going to win four more great years in the White House. We’re going to keep it going. This is the most important election in the history of our country, the most important election. And I never thought I’d say it after what we went through with the last one four years ago, this is a more important election because we’re fighting people that we’ve got to end it. We’ve got to end the fight. We’ve got to put them down. We’ve got to end the fight. Our country will never be a socialist country. We have to end the fight once and for all. For the last half century sleepy Joe Biden has been outsourcing your jobs, opening your borders, and sacrificing American blood and treasure in the endless, horrible, ridiculous foreign wars. Afghanistan, 19 years, 19 years. He voted for the war in Iraq. But for himself, did you know today? You know what happened, right? He put the lid on. You know what the lid is? He’s constantly putting the lid on, constantly putting the lid on. The lid means, I guess it’s referring to a garbage can, right? You put the lid. And he’s putting the lid on. This guy has more lids. I don’t know. There’s something going on. Somebody said it’s strategy. It’s not not, because really strategy would be coming out. And by the way, a lot of things are happening lately. You been noticing? Have you been noticing? I just was asking some people to go back to the fake news and go to the back of the plane. A lot of people up there, a lot of cameras. And I was saying, ” And I wish those cameras would show behind the cameras.” There were thousands of people there, thousands of people there, and thousands of people outside on the street, thousands. There are thousands of people outside. But have you been noticing what’s been happening? People know we’ve done a great job. What’s going to happen? This is going to be as exciting, maybe, I don’t know, you can say more exciting. You remember that beautiful night in November four years ago? Well, I don’t think this one will be as close. I don’t think this is going to be as close. Thank you. No, that’s a chant. In all fairness, I said, “Has anyone in the history of politics,” think about it, Ronald Reagan was popular, but they never had that chant. That is a chant. I won’t even say it because I don’t want to cry, but Ronald Reagan never had that chant. Nobody’s ever had that chant, and you see what we go through. It’s a tough thing. The swamp is deep and it’s vicious. These people are vicious. These people don’t report the truth. It’s very hard. They don’t report the truth. So for instance, I asked them, “Would you please turn the cameras around?” They don’t do that. They never do. They have this shot all the time. I don’t have that big an ego. I don’t want that shot. They have this shot. You know what they show? They show myself and about five people back there. And on occasion, some of the people back there become big stars because they are on camera. But they never move the camera, and I used to think it was the way it is. You couldn’t move it, mechanically you couldn’t do it. And then all of a sudden, we don’t see that anymore. I shouldn’t say it, but we don’t see it anymore. They used to have little fights, right? Little problem. And the camera used to turn like a pretzel to catch it because they viewed that as a bad thing, right, a bad thing. And that camera would turn around. That steel would turn like there’s nothing to it, but they never show the crowds. But you know what? They don’t show Biden’s crowd when seven people show up. And you know what? They don’t show Barack Hussein Obama. He came out to campaign two days ago. Right? And they had 42 people. He drew flies. Did you ever hear the expression? Obama drew flies. But they don’t show that. But we want them to show our crowds because there’s never been anybody, and this is us as a group, anybody, any group, any movement that’s ever gotten the kind of crowds that we have. And I was told about New Hampshire. I have a lot of friends that live up here, but I understand New Hampshire. I was told in New Hampshire, you can’t have big crowds. You have to go to everybody’s dining room and have dinner with them. This was even as I was campaigning. I said, “I’m sorry. It just doesn’t work. You got to get together and all.” And you have guys, they have nothing much to do. They’re politicians, and they’ll go and have dinner with two or three people every night. And they’ll do this for years. And then they come in seventh in the primary or something. I said, “No, we got to do this.” And we’ve been doing this from the beginning. You have the good arena that holds a lot of people, and we pack that all the time. But now with the COVID, what we do, and they keep talking about cases. You know why we have cases so much? Because that’s all we do is test. If we cut our testing down in half, they’d say, well, they wouldn’t say that, but cases would go down. No, we have the best testing and we are coming around. We’re rounding the turn. We have the vaccines. We have everything. We’re rounding the turn. Even without the vaccines we’re rounding the turn. It’s going be over. And you know who got it? I did. Can you believe it? Every time I’d have these meetings, a lot of people, because I can’t put myself in a basement for the next year and a half. Okay? I can’t do it. No I can’t. Or I can’t go to a beautiful bedroom in the White House and lock myself up for a year and a half. You’re president. You have to do your job. And I’d have meetings and I’d leave meetings, and I’d leave a meeting, and I’d say, “That wasn’t good.” A lot of people and there’s a lot of love in the rooms a lot of times. A lot of times there’s no love at all, just the opposite. But I’d say, “That might not be good,” but you got to do your job. And I went and what they do is incredible. The doctors are incredible, and especially when you’re president, because you have more doctors. I don’t know if I could ever get used to this again, going back to a normal where you actually have one doctor. You have a doctor for every single part of your body. It’s true. And they want to touch it, too. They want to grab you. ” Sir, I’m a specialist in this. Could I check this?” I said, “I’d prefer not.” But I didn’t feel good and wonderful doctors. Sean, White House doctors, terrific. They’re all really talented people, but I had 12 of them, literally 12. Johns Hopkins. I had doctors from the best schools, the best hospitals in the world because you’re president, right? And I said, “I’m not feeling too good, fellows. What are we going to do here?” And the following morning, I took something called Regeneron. The following morning, I felt so good. I felt like Superman. I wanted to get back. I didn’t want to cancel anything. Now we didn’t want to be canceling. We didn’t want to be canceling a lot of things, right? Like Biden. I mean, I don’t know what the hell’s wrong with him. He never goes anywhere. And when he does, it’s Delaware. Now, I like Delaware too. But he just wants to say right next to that house. He feels very uncomfortable. Yesterday, he did some kind of a crazy rally with the horns, right? And then the camera made a terrible mistake. The guy’s going to get fired, I’m sure, because the camera turned around and there were so few, there was nobody there. And then he got very agitated, right? You saw that, because you know who was there? Our people were there. Right? And they were screaming and he can’t think too well. He was having a hard time. And he got very angry. And Obama got angry too, because he went out someplace and it was all our people. And today they’re having this incredible rally on long Island. What’s happened to New York is so sad with the crime. Democrat run. Only Democrat run. Where you have Democrat run, you have problems. You have crime. It’s all closed up in many cases, locked down, locked down. By the way, you have an excellent governor here, right? You have an excellent governor. Can I say that? Good. Sometimes I’ll say that and people don’t like it, but you do. You have a good governor, good guy, and he’s with us. And the family is good. And his father is great. His father, I’d see that name Sununu. I said, “Man, he was brutal. He was tough.” And once we won, there was nobody better than him. There was nobody rougher and there was nobody better. But it’s a good family. They really are. They’ve done a good job and you’re opened up and you’re doing business and here we are, here we are. But Biden has the lid on again. I guess he figures if he keeps the lid on, he’s not going to make a stupid statement. He made one yesterday. Yesterday he said, “I’m getting tired of smart people.” No, you got to like smart people. Right? He said that, then he said something much worse. Right? He talked about the fact that we have the most corrupt. He didn’t mean that. They didn’t mean that. But I think maybe we’ll put a clip up. We have a new deal. Oh, there it is. See that little screen? That costs a lot of money. And if we like you, like we do the great state of New Hampshire, if we like you, like we do New Hampshire, we put that up and we have a couple of little clips, like he’s against social security, little things like that. How about his oil comment? And I said, “It took all the way to the end. He was doing okay. I wouldn’t say it was Winston Churchill, but he was doing all right. He was getting through it.” And then all of a sudden it came out, the oil, and he wants to transition. He wants a transition. I said, “Okay, are you listening, Texas? Are you listening, Pennsylvania?” Actually, are you listening? You know why? Because your bills. Because of New York, you have the highest energy bills in the country, New Hampshire, all of new England, because they won’t allow, we’re going to do it anyway, but they won’t allow a pipeline to go through New York up to new England. You know that, right? And because of that, and all it would do is cause jobs because upstate New York has been an economic disaster under Cuomo and people are leaving. But think of it. A pipeline that nobody would see, way underground, would reduce your energy costs by 50, 60, 70%. And Governor Cuomo won’t allow it. So we’re having a little bit of a dispute, and this should’ve been done years ago. I get stuck with everything. I get stuck. But we’ll get it done, we’ll get it done. If we do that, we can get your energy cost down 50%, 60%. So it means a lot to everybody. Sleepy Joe. Are you turning the cameras around? Could I ask you to turn, because you have never seen. People don’t even believe it. Look at them. Look at them. People don’t even believe it. I only get disappointed because honestly, the media, the fake news, is too close to me. If they were further back, we’d get more people up here, my people. I’m saying this to my representatives. If they move that back, they have magnifying lenses that are very good. If you move them back, you can have people. They wouldn’t be blocked out by the fake news. Our lives are blocked out by the fake news, right? But Sleepy Joe voted for NAFTA, which was the worst thing that ever happened to your state and all of new England more than any place. Your factories are still, some of them, empty. And China’s entry into the world trade organization. He shuttered your factories, shipped away your industries, and he allowed deadly drugs. One thing I learned more than any other place, New Hampshire drugs. For some reason, you get hit harder than anybody else. We brought it down 19%. We took it down. Now, we got set back because when the plague came in, all of a sudden we’re looking at different things, but we got it down 19%. I met with your police. We went to the precincts. For some reason, your drug problem, opioids, everything else, is greater than most other states proportionately. And we focused very hard in New Hampshire. We got it down 19%. It’s coming down further. Had a setback when the plague came in from China, but we got it down to 19 and we’re going to get it down a hell of a lot lower than 19 before we’re finished, believe me. And he allowed drugs, deadly drugs, really deadly drugs, opioids, and fentanyl to pour across our borders and flood into to your schools and your towns and communities, and more in New Hampshire proportionately, as I said, than any other place. In 2016, you voted to fire the depraved political establishment and you elected an outsider as your president who is finally putting America first. This is not the crowd that comes in second, okay? When you leave, it’s like a poll, right, except much more accurate, when you leave a place like this, where you have thousands and thousands of people and more people than all of this outside, unfortunately. Can’t get in, which I feel badly about. We put speakers out there, but they can’t get in. But when you leave, you say, “This is not a state where you’re going to come in second.” It’s just not because come in second. If Joe came in, even if he came in in that beautiful Air Force One, is that beautiful? I’ll tell you a quick. We have plenty of time today, right? Is there any football game? We don’t watch football as much anymore, right? Until they stand and honor our country, we don’t do it. Until they honor that. But, when I first came in, I said, “How old is Air Force One?” Now we have the greatest people in the world in our military. They’re incredible. Look at the condition. That plane looks like it’s two days old, right? But it’s 30 years. Can you believe it? So I said, “So what’s going on?” “Well, they’re negotiating with one and they signed a contract for $5.7 billion.” It’s actually two planes. People don’t realize this. Air Force One is two planes, okay? You always have two. You’re very spoiled when you have this job. I guess they figure if it’s ever a little bit off for a little broken, you just rip out the second one for two and a half billion. But it’s a most incredible machine. So anyway, so I said, “Well, but 30 years is a long time.” I’m not talking about for me. I’m talking it’s long time. And I’m good at airplanes, okay? Been very good at airplanes. I said, “So what’s the price?” “5.7 billion.” I said, “You got to be kidding.” For two airplanes, okay? I have friends they order a gulf stream and they pay $ 78 million. I said, “Half of an engine costs more than that.” So 5.7. So I met with the head of Boeing, good man, and I said, “This is the first week.” I said, “We’re not going to buy it.” Signed contract, all done. 5.7 billion. I said, “Too much money. We’re not buying it.” They said, “Why do you say it’s too much?” I said, “Because Obama agreed to it, so it has to be too much.” It’s the only thing I knew. I didn’t know anything about it. I didn’t know anything about it, but I knew if they were buying it, it was too much money. So I said, “Nope, I’m not going to do it.” I said, “Cancel the order.” So I went to a general, I said, “General, I want to cancel the order.” “Yes sir.” And I said, “Why can’t we keep using this 30 years, sir?” And he’s right. Look, planes would come in from especially other countries, but from Arab countries, and it would be a brand new, what’s called a 747 800. That’s brand new right off the thing. It’s actually a much different plane. It’s much longer. It’s got a much bigger wingspan. You wouldn’t believe it. See the top the way it is? It’s a much longer top. I hope you people are interested in this. No, isn’t this better than being on a teleprompter, right? No, but see the front? It’s second floor is much longer. As beautiful as that is, it’s far more beautiful, bigger, more impressive, more everything, and it’s the right thing. So I said, “So general, it’s a signed contract. I want to terminate the contract.” “Yes sir.” I said, “By the way, you can terminate it no problem, right?” “Yes, sir. Very proud of it, sir.” “Good. You don’t have to pay anything, do you?” “Yes, sir. We have a termination fee.” “Oh. How much is the termination fee, general?” “Sir? We pay $250 million then we’re allowed to terminate the contract. It’s 5.7 billion. So for 250 million … ” I said, “Wait a minute, general, wait. Wait, wait. They haven’t built it yet. They haven’t even started it yet. We have to pay $250 million to terminate the contract? I don’t like that deal, general. General, don’t terminate it, because I want to get it. But I don’t want to pay 250. Just don’t terminate it. Just tell them we don’t want it.” “Yes, sir.” So he told them. Then I told them, I said, “Nope, I don’t want it.” And we negotiated for about a month. And I said to the head of Boeing, really good guy, I said, ” Hey Dennis, look, it’s five, seven. It’s got to have a three in front of it.” Now I don’t know anything about it. And it’s very, very special. What they have in this plane they don’t have in any plane in the world, okay? This is incredible, the kind of equipment. The equipment costs more than the plane. So I said, “No, Dennis. It has to have a three in front of it. So this has 5.7, a five.” I said, “Got to have it. In other words, we got to skip the fours. We got to have a three.” “No sir. I can’t do it.” So then he comes back a couple of weeks later. He takes a hundred million off. I said, “Nope, it’s got to have a three.” I said, “Cancel it. I don’t care.” “Don’t cancel it in writing.” I said, “We don’t want the planes.” I was very careful. “We don’t want the planes.” “Are you canceling the order?” I said, “No, no, no. We don’t want the plane,” because I don’t want to pay 250 of your money, if you don’t mind. And by the way, I could tell you about 300 of these stories, all right? These are stories that are all different things. This one, I just see the plane sitting there so beautiful. So I said, “No, we don’t want the plane.” Now I can’t really go to Europe and order the comparable plane because there is no comparable plane, but I can’t. I can’t say, “I’m going to buy it in Europe. I’m going to buy Air Force One in Europe.” Somehow that doesn’t work, so I can’t. I said, “No, we’re going to get used to this. We’re going to have this plane. We’ll fix it up. It’ll be just fine.” So time goes by and they raise it. They bring it down another couple of hundred. They bring it down another couple. And then all of a sudden it started dropping like a rock. And we agreed to 3.95. Somebody said, “Well, that must be a totally different plane.” Nope. In fact, I actually had one generator added. It’s not a big deal, one generator added. Then Boeing came to me. So is 3.9, as opposed to 5.7. Now that took about two months, three months. But isn’t it really nice, right? The same exact plane, except with a different paint job. Our plane is going to be as beautiful as that looks, Jackie O. Our plane is going to be red, white, and blue. Doesn’t that make sense? Red white. And then they came to me and the general came to me. The general came to me and he said, “Sir, I know the way you like everything to be perfect. And sir, instead of coming down, see the big stairway on the left, you’re really up there. When you’re at that stairway, you’re on a three story building, right. And sir, if it’s rainy or bad weather or it’s blowing,” and I’m thinking about my hair, right. Oh, sometimes by the time I get down the big one, the little one is a different deal, but the big one, which we use 95%, by the time I come down that big stairway, sometimes I am wiped out. The wind is blowing. I said, “Is there any wind outside?” Yes sir. 50 miles an hour. That’s good. The stairs are shaking. I’m shaking. The whole thing. By the time I get into the car, I end up running the last… By the time I get into that car, I’m wiped out. Okay, I got to say, “Does anybody have a mirror?” So the general said, “Sir, we can build a new stairway under the plane, sir. It’s a spiral stairway.” I said, “Wow, that’s a great idea.” You’d be totally protected, sir. I said, “Fantastic. How much?” 50. I said, “Wow, 50. That’s a great deal. I’ll take it.” I said, “I’ll take it.” I said, “By the way, so for $50,000, I can build.” No, sir, $50 million. I said, “I don’t want this stairway for $50 million.” I tell you this because you people understand business. No, he said, “We can build it for 50.” I thought he meant $50,000. That’s a lot of money for a stairway. No, we can do it for 50 million. So if you don’t mind, I decided let my hair get messed up, right. So that’s the story. That’s a long story on the beautiful Air Force One. So we have it coming in and can you imagine after all that I better win this damn contest. Can you imagine if I saw Sleepy, Joe? He wouldn’t even know it’s a different plane. He’d get on. Oh this is very nice. Where am I? Where am I? You’re on Air Force One. Oh, I didn’t know that. This is very nice. How old is this plane, he’d say? I’d say, “Brand new, sir. It’s brand new. Just…” If I see that gorgeous, you have to see the striping. It’s incredible. There’ll be nothing like it. And I don’t want to see it. He won’t appreciate it. He won’t appreciate it because he won’t understand it. But anyway, so that’s the story that I tell. I could tell a hundred stories like that. It’s all the same. The waste, it’s all the same. And it was all coming together and then we had to spend $3 trillion on the plague. Can you believe it? With all of that peanuts we’re talking, we had to spend and we signed a trade deal with China, which was so great, but the ink wasn’t dry when we got hit by the China plague and we’ll never forget it. We’ll never forget it. You watch. Sleepy Joe Biden doesn’t care about New Hampshire. I saw that. He left this state before the primary was even over. He abandoned you. He likes to say Pennsylvania. Well, he left them too when he was nine years old. And based on the polls, I’m seeing the people of Pennsylvania understand that very much. And as I said at the very beginning, a lot of strange things. We’re way up in Florida. We’re doing fantastic in Iowa, fantastic in North Carolina. We think really good in Pennsylvania. We’re doing great in the great state of Texas and these aren’t poles. These are people now. Now you don’t need polls so much. These are people. We’re doing great all over. Georgia is looking very good. We’re doing great all over. This could be a very interesting evening on November 3rd. Now the biggest risk we have are the fake ballots. To me, they send millions of ballots all over the country. They found some in a garbage can, military ballots. The name Trump was written in by the military and they found them in a garbage can, thousands and thousands, 500,000 incorrect applications in Virginia, thousands and thousands of things. I say the biggest risk we have are the fake ballots. I voted yesterday in Florida and I went and I voted in person because I like to vote in person, call me old fashioned, but a lot of our people want to vote in person. They want to vote. So I went to Florida. Sir, do you have identification? They said that. And no, and they didn’t mean to be rude. They want to go through like they would. I took out a passport. I gave them a passport. I took out an ID. Wouldn’t it be nice to have voter ID by the way? So the woman who was great, very smart. And I gave her the passport. I gave her the ID. She said, “Sir, I think you might be President Trump.” Okay, so I qualify. And then I sat and they gave me the voting thing slips, very computerized, very good. I went through everyone. They said, “Sir, is this it?” Yes. Good. And then I signed my name on something else. Sir, you can go to the booth and please, here’s a pad. You can keep it secret. I said, “I don’t want to keep it secret. I voted for Donald Trump.” I don’t want to keep it secret. Now if I voted for Sleepy Joe, that would be a story, right. That I would want to keep secret. No, but I went in, the people were fantastic. And I went in, really professional people, great people. I went in, I took it. I took it out of the folder. I mean, they wanted me to put it in a folder just to walk it 20 feet to a machine. I took it out. I put it in that. I put it in again, two pages, certain things they had and a lot of different races, the presidency and other races, good races, congressperson, good races. Put them in. And I said, “Wow, there was no cheating. There was no way you could cheat. There was no way anything could go wrong. It was like a perfect deal.” Now, they send. Think of that. So that’s one way. The other way they send millions of ballots. We don’t know who’s sending them. We don’t know where they’re going. We don’t know who’s bringing them back. We don’t know who signed them. In Nevada, they want to have a thing where you don’t have to have any verification of the signature. It is so terrible. And you know who knows it more than us? The Democrats, all Democrat run states are the ones that are the problem and they know it. And they say, “He’s against our freedom. He’s against our freedom.” No, no. I want to have a real election. I don’t want to have millions of votes sent to millions of different people. And I call them unsolicited. I say, “Solicited is good.” That’s where you write in. You want, they send it to you, et cetera, which still is not as good as being there, but it’s pretty good. But when you have unsolicited, meaning you don’t want them, they call them universal. I said, “That name doesn’t make sense.” What does it mean? It doesn’t mean anything. They call it different names. I came up with a name. They have millions of unsolicited ballots being sent all over and it’s no good. It’s no good. And there’s tremendous. Every day you pick up the newspaper and you read about the only good thing is we have people watching them like crazy, both law enforcement and yourselves and everybody, but in Philadelphia, which is notorious for what goes on, we want to have poll watchers. They won’t let us have poll watchers. So we’re in court over poll watchers. Why won’t they let you have a poll watcher? What’s wrong? Think of it. What’s wrong? Philadelphia has been unbelievable. When a candidate, very wonderful candidate happened to lose very badly, Ren, a number of years ago and a man named Mitt Romney. Did anybody ever hear of Mitt Romney? He did so badly in Philadelphia. Almost nobody voted for him. Now you know that’s not so, but they gave almost no votes for him, almost nothing. And you know that’s not so and it’s not right. And we want poll watchers in Philadelphia and they won’t let us have them so we’re in court. But think of it, when they won’t let you have a poll watcher, what’s that all about? What’s that all about? So we’re watching it very closely, but I was really impressed yesterday in Florida because there was no way there could be any cheating. There was no way. These people were great. The system is great and there was no way you’re voting twice, you’re voting 20 times or you’re not voting at all. It was a beautiful thing to see, but the ballots are not that way. The ballots get handled by many, many people by the time they even get there and it shouldn’t be allowed. And the Democrats know it’s a hoax and they know and it’s going to cause problems. Then we have a ruling from a court. I won’t say which court, a ruling that the ballots can go beyond November 3rd and then they can take time too, in the state of Pennsylvania, which we love, which we think we’re going to win. I love Pennsylvania. I won it the last time against crooked Hillary, right. It was the first time in a long time that somebody won. And we have a situation where they have their ballots and they have a long time to count the ballots. A lot of bad things will happen during that period of time. Terrible things will happen, crooked, dishonest things. But that means that Pennsylvania, a major state, an important state, very important to me, I’m there all the time. I went to school there, Pennsylvania. So if we don’t know the result on November 3rd, that means unlike has always been where you generally find out the election that night or soon, we could be going on forever with this. It’s the craziest thing. And it’s frankly, it’s a crazy ruling and we shouldn’t let it happen. We shouldn’t let it happen. I think that’s my biggest fear. My biggest risk for this election is the unsolicited, the millions of unsolicited ballots they’re sending out. In California, they’re sending millions and millions and millions of ballots. People are getting ballots that don’t want them. People are getting ballots that don’t even know why they’re getting them. It’s a terrible thing. Sleepy Joe Biden works for big tech and big donors. And I’ll tell you, when you watch what’s happened, how he’s being protected because you see what’s going on. He is a corrupt politician. And one of the reasons, and I would say the primary reason he’s put the lid on again is because he can’t answer the questions. No, he can’t answer these questions. He goes to China, the family makes a fortune. He goes to Ukraine, his son gets put on a board for $183,000 a month. How about Russia? Russia, the wife of the mayor of Moscow pays him three and a half million dollars for the son and then he has stuff that he has to give his father 10%. Then he has another one where it’s 50%. What the hell is going on? Terrible. And then the media refuses to write it. They refuse except for the New York Post by the way, who’s stock has gone way up. I have a lot of respect for the New York Post. What they’ve done is incredible. So I’m not just running against Joe Biden, I’m running against the left wing media and Silicon Valley, censors who want to manipulate and control the American people. No, it’s unbelievable. And if you say anything bad about Biden, they block you, they take you down or they make it so you can’t go on any of these sites, Twitter or any of them. It’s unbelievable. Some high quality people. They put up a story from the New York Post, fourth largest newspaper in the country and the oldest by far founded by Alexander Hamilton, somebody puts up a story about this Biden corruption, which is incredible, and they block the story and take down his site. It’s unbelievable. The great Charlie Kirk, Charlie Kirk, but many of them. With your vote, we will continue to fight for American workers, lower drug prices. We are bringing drug prices down, way down. It’s already happened. Support our great police, protect the 2nd Amendment, defend our borders that ensure more products are proudly stamped with that very beautiful phrase made in the USA like the old days, right. We go back to the old days sometimes. Made in the USA, people used to be so proud of that. We are again. We will deliver record prosperity, epic job growth, groundbreaking therapies, the therapies are unbelievable. By the way, here I am. Now, I don’t know, maybe I didn’t need it. Maybe I didn’t need it, but I’m happy. I took that Regeneron. Regeneron, Superman, and a safe vaccine. And we have many of our greatest companies and labs are coming out very quickly with the vaccines. They’re doing great. Very shortly, very quickly. It’s going to be delivered fast. That will quickly end the pandemic. It’s ending anyway. We’re rounding the turn, but the vaccine will get it down fast because we want normal life to resume, normal life. We just want normal. Normal life, normal life. And next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country. Last year, New Hampshire had by far the best year economically that you’ve ever had. And I can say that for I think every state in the Union. I really think just about, I don’t have to go check. I don’t have to be like Joe, where he has no idea. You just say no, it’s uniform. I think just about every state in the Union and you see what’s happening now. We have a super V. We’re recovering at a level, housing starts. The Atlanta Fed just predicted, now this is not a forecast by me, this is the Atlanta Fed, that GDP will rise for the third quarter, which will end by the way. I think the number will be produced on November 1st, which is just before, but hopefully you’ll have voted by that time. That’s the crazy thing. Everybody will have voted before some of this incredible news comes in, but the news has been very good anyway. They’re predicting GDP up 35%. Nobody’s ever had that, right. I think 8%. I don’t know what the record is, but like eight or nine or something maybe as a record, but this is 35% up, faster than any other country anywhere in the world. We went down less and we’ve gone up faster. So within my first year in office, I delivered the largest tax cuts and reform in the history of our country. We cut taxes $2,200 a year so that’s for the typical American family. We doubled the child tax credit $1,000 a child, and we increased median household income to the highest levels ever recorded. Highest. Then we had to close it up, save millions of lives, at least 2 million lives, and now we’re opening it up. The radical Biden Harris agenda. What do you think of Harris? Oh boy. More liberal than Crazy Bernie, could you believe it? So you have Crazy Bernie. He’s crazy, there’s no question, but he’s a good sport. He’s a great sport. No, no. Have you ever seen anybody lose so much and be so happy about it? It’s happened now twice. Is Bernie running again in four years? Media, is Bernie Sanders projected to run again in four years? I think so. He’ll be up there. One thing about him, he fights. He fights, but he somehow doesn’t mind losing because Elizabeth Warren, a neighbor of yours. No, Elizabeth Warren super radical left, not as bad as Bernie, and by the way, not even close to Kamala, but if she would have, and I say all the time, if she would have left because she was gone. She was gone. If she would have left before Super Tuesday, Bernie would have won every single state that Sleepy Joe. He was shocked when he won. They said, “Joe, you won.” What? What? I did? How? What happened? Well, Elizabeth Warren stayed in the race, Joe. So when people voted, they voted, they split the vote. So Bernie Sanders would’ve gotten all of it. He didn’t have to get all. If he got just a few of her votes, he would’ve won everything. I mean, literally, but he would’ve gotten almost all of them. He said, “Oh, okay. Explain? How does that work?” They said, ” Forget it Joe.” He wanted to know how that worked. The radical Biden Harris agenda is projected to slash the typical American’s income. And you saw this in the Wall Street Journal, income by $6,500 a year over a short period of time. And also, it will destroy at least 5 million jobs. Joe Biden is promising the largest tax hike in American history. This is the first time, I said it last night, we were in Ohio. We were in Wisconsin, we were in North Carolina. I’m doing three or four of these suckers a day. That’s not bad, right. And he’s got the lid on every… I said, “Where is he campaigning?” Sir, he’s decided. You can’t have a president in this world where you have President Xi, President Putin, Kim Jong-Un, and lots of people. You cannot have a low energy president. Now, there’s a reason he’s got the lid and I’m trying to figure it out. And I have a feeling it’s because of the corruption because he can’t have. Did you see where he walked out in primetime right after it happened holding ice cream, right? And the press asked him, “What flavor is it, sir? What flavor?” Uh, I think it’s vanilla and chocolate. That was the question. They don’t ask me questions like that. What flavor, sir? I don’t think he likes me too much. We better win. No, he’s not a nice guy. He’s not. No, people that knew him in primetime. People that knew him in primetime. He was never a nice guy, phony guy. He was never a nice guy. I don’t think he’s a nice guy, but now he’s probably more agitated than ever before. Biden’s $4 trillion tax increase is a missile aimed at the heart of the middle-class and middle-class families. That’s all it is. You’re going to lose all your jobs. These companies are all going to go back where they came from. We brought in tremendous numbers of companies. I mean, look at the auto business. We hadn’t had a factory in 40 years and now they’re opening up all over Michigan, all over the place. Ohio, North Carolina, South Carolina. I’d say to the Prime Minister Abe, a great, great gentleman who retired. He had a problem, medical problem, but he retired. I’d say, “Shinzo, you got to open some factories in Michigan. You got to open up some factories in the US. I don’t care where, you’re going to open up factories, Shinzo. You’re selling too many cars made in Japan. You got to make them in the US.” Then he’d say, “Well, I don’t do that. I mean, look, we don’t have anything to do with that. This is done by the private sector.” I said, “Shinzo, you’re a powerful man. You can do it.” I really can’t. I said, “You have to do it.” Next day, they announced five companies were opening up factories so that was the end of that. And he’s a great guy, Shinzo, and I hope he’s going to be well. He was a great leader of Japan. In my second term, I will pass another historic middle class tax cut. It’s already… Biden, all my life I’ve been studying politics. I watched it. I was on the other side. I was a contributor to like everybody. They came to my office. I was a contributor to everybody. And they would come in, but all my life I watched and I’d watch Texas. And I’ve never seen this before where somebody goes, “We will raise your taxes. Vote for me.” No, it’s never happened. I’ve always watched politicians. We will cut your taxes. We will cut your taxes. We will cut your taxes. Biden gets up, “We will raise your taxes.” And people say, ” Oh.” A lot of people don’t get it. They’ll go like, “Oh, did I hear that right?” No, he’s going to raise your taxes. So Biden wants to eliminate oil. Think of it in Texas. You saw him in the debate the other night. Now, he can’t get away with that. I said, “So tell me, because he almost made it.” And then that last question got him. And Kristin, who is not particularly in my camp, I thought she did a good job to be honest. I thought she did a good job. She looks at him. She goes, “Why would you do that?” And then I said, “Yeah, why would you do that?” And unfortunately for his party, he said he will transition out of oil. And I said, “Are you listening, Texas, right? Are you listening Pennsylvania? And are all the people in the country because we have an energy independent country right now.” And once we get New Hampshire and New England, the pipeline cutting across New York, which we’re very close to getting, you will have energy prices that will be low, very low. Very low. And nobody else will be able to get that pipeline, that I can tell you, nobody else. That means that no heat in New Hampshire winters. $5 a gallon gasoline, much more than that I think. Think of it, what are you now? $2. And you’ll go under $2, right, $2, right. Armenia, you know Armenia? We’re working on that. You know we’re working. We did it with Kosovo and Serbia. Do you believe I got three nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize? Can you believe it? The Middle East, we’re doing peace. I did it the opposite way of what these fools did for years. We just signed the third Sudan yesterday. We signed. So we will have Bahrain, UAE, United Arab Emirates led by a great gentleman, a great leader, a great warrior, actually, Muhammad. And yesterday we got Sudan. I mean, no blood in the sand, no cost, no this, no that. The opposite way. And then we got one, Serbia. We had Serbia, because this relates to Armenia. We had Serbia, Kosovo. We’re doing a trade deal. I said, “Wait a minute. These people, right, Serbia, these people have been killing themselves. They’ve been killing each other for years and years and decades. And we’re dealing with both of them unrelated.” I said, “Fellas, if you don’t get your act together, we’re not going to deal with you. What the hell do we have to deal for? We don’t have to. We’re doing trade deals.” I said, “Wait a minute.” They’ve been fighting each other and killing each other for years. I told my people, “Tell them they got to work a deal. Otherwise, we’re not going to do a deal with either of them.” Cost us nothing. And you know what? They hugged and they kissed in the Oval Office and they were so happy. And this is after many years. Nobody thought they could come together. Nobody thought they’d come together. That deal was worse than Israel, if you think about it, and the Palestinians. Israel and the Palestinians, they say can’t, it’ll come together. It’ll come together. We stopped paying. We used to give the Palestinians $750 million a year. And I said, “Look, we’re not going to pay you if you’re not going to make a deal. Why would we pay?” And other people said that was a terrible thing. It wasn’t a terrible thing because they’d say death to America, death to Israel, et cetera, et cetera. And now they want to talk. They all want to talk. So we have three countries. We have many countries lined up. You’ll end up with peace in the Middle East with nothing but for nothing. And a neighbor of yours, John Kerry, said two years ago, “It would be impossible to do the deal that way.” No, no. That’s the only way you can do the deal. It’s all coming together beautifully. We’re going to have peace in the Middle East. What we’ve done is pretty amazing. But with Serbia, Kosovo, so we signed a deal. So they gave me a Nobel Prize for that. They gave me a Nobel Prize for something else. They should give me a Nobel Prize for what I did in Syria. When I say Nobel Prize, nomination, I don’t know. I don’t know. But with Serbia. So now we have Armenia. Look at the Armenia. They are incredible people. They’re fighting like hell, right? They’re fighting like hell. And you know what? We’re going to get something done because, thank you. And I love you, too. You know the Armenians have had a tough go. In fact, I was in yesterday, Ohio, actually. I was in Ohio because I went to various stops. But in Ohio we had a tremendous group of Armenians with the flag and the whole thing, the spirit. And the problems that they have and the death and the fighting and everything else, we’ll get that straightened out. I call that an easy one. Okay? We’ll get that. Go back and tell your people. Go back and tell your people. All right? We’ll get that straightened out. Armenia. Why not? It’s easy. If you know what you’re doing, it’s like that. If you know what you’re doing, it’s easy. But we will. But think of that, with Kosovo, Serbia I said, “Well, we’re doing these two. We’re not doing either deal unless they put it together.” And they actually, they both came back. The prime ministers, they came back, they were in the Oval Office two weeks ago, hugging and kissing. It was an incredible thing, very historic. And what are we doing? We’re saving a lot of lives. We’re saving a lot of good people from being killed. See, normally I wouldn’t tell you all this stuff, but we’re in the afternoon. Where are we going from here? There’s no more NFL that you watch. Where the hell are we going? Biden has also vowed. Do you think sleepy Joe would be doing these things? I don’t think so. I don’t think. He’ll go back to bed. Hillary used to spend a lot of time in bed too, but she had more energy than him. She did. They said, “What’s the difference between crooked Hillary Clinton and Biden?” I said, “Well, obviously they’re both crooked, but let’s get out of that.” The big difference is she had more energy, but not much. And she’s a more intelligent person. I will say that. She’s a much more intelligent person. Until she used the word deplorables, I thought she was very smart. Biden has also vowed to impose the highest business tax rate in the developed world on companies that created jobs in our country. They came over here. They created jobs. They’ll be gone in two minutes. It would trigger a mass exodus of companies and jobs out of America and back into the places they came for or other places. That’s what happens. They would leave. And we don’t want people to leave. We want them to stay. And we want those jobs and we want that income. You’ve had them leave already under NAFTA. Biden also pledged to eliminate our tariffs on China. We’re taking in tens of billions of dollars. We taxed them where they dumped the steel. We taxed them where they targeted our farmers. I gave our farmers, this doesn’t pertain too much to you, but a little bit. I gave our farmers $28 billion from China because they were targeted and it kept our farmers solvent and actually strong. In other words, he wants to raise taxes on American factories and give preferential treatment to Chinese factories. There’s nobody that wants to see us raise taxes on companies more than China and other countries, because they’re going to pick up the business. So remember this. If Biden wins, China wins. If we win, New Hampshire wins and America wins. It’s very simple. It’s very simple. Besides that, how could he make a deal with China when he’s taking a lot of money out of China, right? For himself and his family. His son walked away with a billion and a half dollars. He gets fees on a billion and a half. So how can a guy like that, seriously? Did you see the letter? Oh, that laptop he’s got. You know the laptop? You know what it’s called? I said it last night in Wisconsin. It’s called the laptop from hell. Right? That laptop. That laptop is not good. But did you see that he wants $10 million a year from China for introductory reasons? In other words, he’s going to introduce him to people. You know who the people are going to be? His father. Going to introduce him to his father. So this guy was, we won’t say why and how, sadly no longer in the Navy. Right? Empty years, nothing. And then his father becomes Vice President and now he’s making tens of millions of dollars. It’s wrong. It’s wrong. And Joe’s making it too, by the way. Joe’s making it, too. 10%. We got to give 10% to the big guy. Oh, what does that mean? Tell us. What is 10% to the big guy mean? Explain that. That’s why Joe has the lid on. The Biden tax hikes will also reimpose Obamacare’s individual mandate penalty, which I ended. I ended the individual mandate, most unpopular part, which really makes it not even Obamacare anymore. We took the most egregious thing, and Obamacare was the individual mandate. You had to pay a fortune for the privileges of not paying a fortune to have terrible health insurance. All right? And in the meantime, we’ve brought the rates down. We’ve done it well, we’ve done a great job with it, but much better would be if we come up with brand new healthcare. We’ll see what happens in the Supreme Court. Always protecting people with pre-existing conditions. Always. 80% of this tax would fall on Americans making less than 50,000 a year. He keeps talking about the 400. It doesn’t work that way. And he knows that. Well, he doesn’t know it, but the people surrounding him. There’s virtually no aspect of American life that Joe Biden does not want to tax and regulate into oblivion. And worse will be the regulations because the taxes will go through the roof. But I think that the biggest reason we were successful is that I took off more regulations than any president, whether it’s four years, eight years, or in one case, more. He’s always wanted to do this, massively cut your social security and your Medicare. And it’s all part of the war on the middle-class. I don’t know. I don’t know what he’s thinking. I’ve never seen a politician that wants to hurt social security that survives, and then he denied it. But you’ll see in a second, because you don’t have to take my word for it. Just listen to Biden explain his crazy views and crazy plans just a little while ago. So roll out the video. I do this because I love this state. I spent a fortune for that. So I hope it works. I hope it works. So he did try and cut your social security. Just like he said for a year, there will be no fracking, and then he got through that and he goes to Pennsylvania and he says, “You can frack.” And then he denied it. And the media never did anything about it. They don’t ask him the question. But the other day, fortunately, in the debate in one of the better parts of the debate, he said he’s getting rid of it. He will not let you frack. It’s not him. His party will never let you frack. Okay? It’s a million jobs in Pennsylvania. And for you, it’s billions of dollars in energy costs. I will cut your taxes, not raise them. And I will always protect Medicare and social security, just like I’ve been doing. This election is a choice between a Trump recovery, and I call it a Trump super recovery, because that’s what’s happening. You see the name. And a Biden depression. If he gets in, you’re going to have a depression, the likes of which you’ve never seen before with the possible exception of 1929. He’s going to raise your taxes through the sky. He’s going to put all those regulations. It would take 18 years to get a highway approved. We have it down to two. We’re trying to get it down to one and it may not get approved for environmental or for safety reasons, but you’re going to know very quickly. We have regulation cuts. Nobody’s ever seen anything like it. He wants to put all that garbage back in. All that wasted, wasted stuff. And we have more cuts to come and we need regulation. We’re going to have regulation, but it’s going to be reasonable. It’s not going to be where it’s impossible to build a simple road from point A to point B. So you have a choice, New Hampshire, between a Trump boom or a Biden lockdown. He wants to lock it down. He said, “No, I’d lock it down.” We’re not locking down. We understand the disease. We’re going to take such, and we’ve been, taking care of our elderly, especially with heart or diabetes problems. And we’re going to take care of it. And we’re going to be careful, and we’re going to be vigilant, but we’re not locking down. He would lock it down in a heartbeat. He would. The Biden lockdown would permanently destroy the lives and dreams of tens of millions of our citizens. Wipe out what will be, and what’s turning out to be, the greatest economic comeback of all time. You see what’s happening. Desperately hurt our small businesses, inflict lasting harm on our children and massively reduce life expectancy for the American people, life expectancy. So, for the American people, you see what happens. And I came up with a statement. I don’t know, I think it was me. They’ll try and find somebody else said it 25 years ago, the cure cannot be worse than the problem itself. When you look at what’s happening with these lockdowns, right? I mean, look at Michigan, how she’s so vicious. She’s vicious to everybody but her husband, he can do whatever he wants. He can go sailing. He could do whatever he wants now. No, but look, and we won that case in the Supreme Court. Michigan has to open. It was unconstitutional. She was running like jail cells over there and Pennsylvania, right? And so many other places. But fortunately you people are in good shape. You’re in good shape. You have no complaints. Lockdowns will also lead to a surge in drug overdoses. That’s what’s happening. Drugs, alcohol, depression, suicides all over the place. Tremendous family disputes like they’ve never had before. It’s a horrible thing that happens. The cure can’t be worse. Under my leadership, we have marshaled the full power of government in our fight to end the opioid epidemic, to help those addicted and to keep our precious children from getting hooked on drugs. It’s had a tremendous impact. And it’s really because this was one of the first states I really worked hard on and campaigned in. I learned so much about that whole drug problem from New Hampshire. This is really the place. And you have incredible law enforcement police, fire departments, where I met with them. And they know this problem better than the experts. Biden is the shutdown candidate. The Democrats are the shutdown party. They will shut down your job, shut down your schools, your businesses, your police departments, your energy. They’ll shut down your freedom. And they will shut down the greatest economic comeback in the history of our country. That’s what we’re doing. Do you know how hard it was for me to say, “We’ll shut it down”? We have the greatest economy in history. We’re blowing away China. China was supposed to overtake us 10 years ago. 2019 they were going to overtake us. They were so far behind. We left them in the dust. Now all of a sudden we have to shut it down. But we saved, remember, 2.2 million people were going to die. We saved 2 million people and now we’re opening up and it was a great honor. We had such incredible people. Ventilators, what we did with ventilators. We didn’t have ventilators and now we’re making them for the entire world. We have all we can use in our country. We got along great with a lot of the governors. Some governors, they were all thankful of the phone. “Sir, this is incredible what you’ve done for this state, that state.” If they happen to be not good people, they would then go out and see the reporters. These people right there. And they’d say, “We’re not happy with the job the President is doing.” We got them gowns and masks and goggles and ventilators and everything else. But now we have the vaccines coming way ahead of schedule. If this were another administration, you wouldn’t have vaccines for three years. If this were another administration, you wouldn’t have Regeneron that nobody heard of four months ago. You wouldn’t have these new super drugs. And you look at the mortality rate down 85%. 85. That’s incredible. And then you look at Europe and what’s going on. They always used to use Europe. Now they’re not using it anymore. Yet as we’ve seen from surging cases in Europe, their never ending shutdowns. It just never stops. Europe shut it down tight, shut it down tight. And now they have a surge. And it’ll work out, but it should have never happened. Should have never happened from China. They closed up most of China, but they didn’t close the world. They let it come to Europe, the US, the rest of the world. Joe Biden has made a corrupt bargain in exchange for his party’s nomination. He’s handed control of his party over to the socialists. He’s handed it over to some very, very bad people. They are filled, and I’ve seen it, they are filled with rage and desperate for power. This election day, the people of New Hampshire must stop the anti-American radicals by giving Joe Biden, and it’s really not Joe Biden, it’s the people that control him, the people that surround him, because Joe doesn’t have a clue. Joe doesn’t have a clue. I really believe he doesn’t have a clue. We can be nice and we can say, “Oh, it’s okay,” or, “Let’s vote for him. We feel sorry.” There’s nothing to feel sorry about. This is our democracy. This is our country. We have to do what’s right. And he’s not a nice person. He’s not a nice person. We have to give the Democrats a thundering defeat. And that includes Congress. That includes your Senate. By the way, you have a very good Senate candidate. I hope you’re going to get out there because Corky, where is he? Is he here? Corky. Corky Messner. Where is Corky? Corky Messner is doing great. I hear he’s doing great, right? Is he? He better do great. He’s running for somebody that doesn’t help our nation very much, I will tell you that. So I hope you’re going to be able to get out and vote for Corky and Congressional Candidates, Matt Bowers and Steve Negron. Right? Great. Where are they? Where are they? Where are they? Hello, fellas. Thank you very much. Good luck. Good luck. And also a friend of mine who’s been with me from day one, GOP Chairman, Steve Stepanek. Where is Steve? Where is Steve? Steve, are we doing okay? Because otherwise you’re going to be fired so fast. We’re doing good? Steve is great. He loves this state and he loves our country and he’s the head of the GOP. And he tells us we’re going to win. He said, “Sir, could you come up for a rally?” I said, “When would you like it?” “How about Sunday?” I said, “That’s great.” So I got in. It’s okay. So I got it about one o’clock in the morning, just left. Actually four states. Left Florida, right, where I voted. I went to North Carolina, I went to Ohio. I did a big one in Ohio. The crowds were unbelievable. It’s an unbelievable state. We got Big Ten football back. I got it back. You know why? Because Biden and his group said, “Donald Trump killed Big Ten football.” I said, “What do I have to do with Big Ten? What’s this all about?” And then I said, “Well, not only didn’t we kill, I didn’t even know they weren’t going to open. I’m more focused on China, if you don’t mind.” And when I heard that, I said, “That’s terrible.” I called the commissioner of football, the commissioner of Big Ten, nice guy, Warren. I said, “Commissioner, we got to get it back.” And he was good. And we worked very hard. I had a great group of people, Tim Pataki and some others, and we got it back. And then we got PAC-12 back, too. I said, “Get it back, get it back. We got to get it back.” So we have Big Ten opened up. Ohio State won and Wisconsin won so they both won. It’s nice that they won. I wouldn’t have wanted to go there if they lost, but they don’t lose too often. But Steve has been with us from the beginning and he’s been fantastic. He was with us for the great primary win, which was so good. And another man who’s been incredible, he was from day one. He said, ‘Sir, you’re going to win.” I said, “Say it again.” “You’re going to win, sir.” And he’s a real character, and he’s a really good guy and his name, I’m sure nobody ever heard of him, Corey Lewandowski. Where’s Corey? Where is he? Oh, there they are. I’m looking for these people. Hi, Corey. Are you doing okay, Corey? Are we going to win, Corey? You better win, Corey. I’ll never speak to you again. I’ll never speak to you again. Hey Corey, next time you could take a bigger chunk of the runway, please. We’d get everybody. Okay? Pretty good crowd. Right? But even bigger is what’s outside. What’s outside. No, Corey’s been a friend of mine for a long time. He’s great. He does. He loves his state and he loves our country and he’s a great person. He’s a great person. In my first three years, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world. And now we are doing it again. You know, I see the hat, Make America Great Again Again, Make America Great Again Again. I’m going to add another again. This way I can sell you all an extra hat. It all goes to the campaign. Make America Great Again Again. No, we did. We had it. We had the greatest economy. And I’ll tell you something, we were coming together. You’ve heard me say this. I was getting calls from people that normally I wouldn’t be getting calls from. We had the best numbers, the best everything in every way, and things were happening. Success will bring us together and we’re going to soon have that same. We will soon be in that position again. Very soon. We increased family income over $6,000, more than five times the gains in all eight years. So think of that. In three and a half years, we did more than they did in eight years, times five. I mean, think of that. African American unemployment, Hispanic American unemployment, and Asian American unemployment all reached the lowest levels ever recorded. Women had unbelievable numbers and more women were working than ever at any time before. Think of it. Think of it. Think of that. And by the way, suburban women, you know that. I got rid of the regulation. You know, they keep saying, he’s not going to do well with suburban women. And you know why they say that? WhY Because I’m going to stop crime. You know, their next spot, the Antifa people, it only happens with the Democrat run areas, right? But like in Portland, but their next stop is suburbia. But I got rid of the regulation that will allow projects to be built right alongside of your home. And I think that I have a feeling suburban women are going to be voting for Trump. And you know, if Biden gets in, they’re putting that regulation, very specific, they’re putting that regulation back, and you’re going to have low-income housing and projects built. You’re going to have crime like you never saw. And you’re going to want to get the hell out of suburbia. So I think we’re going to do very well with suburban women. And I think it’s going to be one of the surprise. Remember last time, four years ago, we listened. I suffered with this for six months. My wife would say, our First Lady, by the way says hello to everybody. She tested positive also. How about that? She was positive and then she was better within a few days, you know? But she, thank you, but she’s, she’s great. People love, they love Melania. Every time I go, they have signs, we love our First Lady. We love our First Lady. She’s great. Great First Lady. She represents you well, I can tell you. They don’t treat her fairly, but that’s all right. She understands it very well. She’s done a great job, very popular. But when you look at what we’ve done, and the last time, right, four years ago, he will not do well with women. Right, Corey? Remember that? He will not do well with women. And then they said, wow, he did well with women. They’re crying. They crying. They said, “What happened? What happened?” He did well with women. Was that the greatest evening, really? Remember? Remember? I wasn’t going to win Florida. I wasn’t going to win North Carolina. I wasn’t going to win Pennsylvania. Michigan wasn’t even talked about. Nobody had won Michigan for decades and decades, republican. Wasn’t going to win Wisconsin, same thing. All of a sudden they start, the evening begins, “Donald Trump has won the state of Ohio by eight points.” Nobody ever thought possible. That hasn’t happened. So I started off with Ohio and they all said, “Eight points. What’s going on?” That’s when we knew there was something happening. Eight points. Donald Trump won. Then we won Florida. We won Georgia. We won South Carolina. Then we won their firewall. They called it North Carolina. They spent a fortune. They spent a fortune in North Carolina. We won North Carolina and then we just ran it up. It was a beautiful, right? And then you saw these very unbiased anchors with the tears coming down. They were very unbiased. Remember John King with the red board, right? His hand was shaking at the end. He was like, “Well, this is not that bad that he lost Florida, that Hillary lost Florida. She could do.” But then when we started getting into Pennsylvania, North Carolina, they started getting a little bit worried. Right? No, that was an amazing evening. And we’re going to have an even more amazing evening in 10 days. After the virus hit, we recovered faster than any major nation in the world. We’re in the process now, but there’s no nation in the world that’s recovered like we’ve recovered. Since April, we created a record 11.4 million jobs. We’ve spent the last four years reversing the damage Joe Biden and Obama inflicted. Look. Look. We’ve done more in 47 months than sleepy Joe has done in 47 years, and I really mean it, too. I really do. Biden is the living embodiment of the corrupt and treacherous political class that I’ve had to deal with. Nobody told me the swamp was going to be that vicious or that deep. Swamp creatures, I can’t even believe it. I thought it would be a lot easier. They’re tougher, smarter, more vicious, and we’re beating the hell out of them. We’re beating the hell out of them. And they got rich by bleeding America dry. These same wealthy interests are now funding my opponent’s campaign. By the way, you know all the money he raises? I could raise much more. I could sit for one day in the White House and call up every guy on Wall Street, the heads of every firm. I need $10 million. I need $25 million right now. Give it to the campaign. I’d have money. I would set every record in the book. I don’t want to do that because when you do that, when you do that, number one, we don’t need it. You remember, last time we had, I mean, Hillary spent three or four times more money. It’s not about the money. In fact, recently I was criticized. They said, Hillary Clinton raised more money than Donald Trump. I said, “What the hell?” Because you know, we won, and they’re bragging that she raised more money. My father taught me a long time ago, if you can win and spend less money, that’s a good thing, not a bad thing. Right? That’s a good thing. But I would have those donors. They would be talking, “Trump raised $900 million.” I could do that so easy, but I don’t want to do that. If I do that, you’ll see there’s something wrong. I’m the President of the United States. I know many of these people. Every time he raises big money like that, they’ve made deals. They’ve made deals. They’re very simple. I serve the people. Joe Biden is proven to be a corrupt politician, whether you like it or not. He’s a corrupt politician. And if I don’t sound like a typical Washington politician it’s because I’m not a politician. And People of New Hampshire, you had a lot to do with it because that was a very big win we had here in that primary. And you don’t want a politician. If I don’t always play by the rules of the Washington establishment, it’s because I was elected to fight for you, and I fight harder than any President has ever fought before. I ended the NAFTA nightmare, and you know it better than anybody else. You have the scars of it better than almost any other place in the United States, and proudly signed the brand new USMCA, which has just kicked in, whole different ball game. I wouldn’t say Mexico and Canada are thrilled with that deal, but that’s okay. I took the toughest ever action to stand up to China. Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure border in U.S. history. And the wall is going to be finished very shortly, over 400 miles. We’re doing 10 miles a week. 10 miles a week. We’re doing 10 miles a week. Biden and Harris, the wall, you notice they don’t talk about the wall anymore. They used to say, “The wall will never get built.” Every day, front page hammering me, hammering me. I had a major party, the Democrats along with the fake news media, and now we find out Big Tech, and the RINOs, too. The RINOs. You know, the RINOs in many ways, are worse than all of them. That’s Republican in name only. Does anybody know? No, I had this major group of guys and they used to hammer me. The wall will not happen. It will not happen. Then I won a couple of cases. They kept saying, then the wall started. Now they never mentioned the wall anymore. And by the way, Mexico is paying for the wall and you do know that, okay? A fee. Biden and Harris have put forward the most radical immigration plan ever conceived by a major party, including nationwide catch and release, which means open borders. It’s a disaster. Catch, you catch a murderer, you catch a rapist, you know they’re murderers, you know their rapists and you release them only into our country. If you don’t mind, I ended it. And it was very tough to end it. It was very tough. And then Joe said the other night, “And they come back to court.” No, no, no. They never come back. I told him only a very low IQ individual comes back. They never come back. He said, “They come back for a trial.” They say, “Come back in four years.” And then nobody comes back. Why would they come back? There’s no reason to come back. They would never come back. Only, I’m serious, like 1%, a tiny fraction comes back. And he so solid on that. Right? You saw that. “They then come back for a trial.” He was making it sound, catch and release was a disaster. I’ve ended it. We’re not letting criminals into our country. Our country would surrender control of our border, and we would surrender control to the cartels in Mexico who are vicious. The Biden border plan would be the biggest gift in the history. There’s never been anything like it to drug traffickers, to human traffickers. They traffick in women, not so much children, not men almost at all. They traffick in women. And because of the wall, they can’t come in. This is a problem, by the way, that’s all over the world. This is not just us and Southern border. This is a modern day problem at a level that it’s never been before. They traffick in women all over the world. And it’s because of the internet, because of the computer, but it’s because of the internet and children to a much lesser extent, but women. But the drug traffickers would be allowed to freely infiltrate our country and pump their poison into our towns and schools, especially places like New Hampshire, where it was so prevalent before I came onto the scene, and it’s been a lot better, and we’re going to get it much, much better. Under my administration, over the last three years, Border Patrol and ICE have seized over two million pounds of deadly narcotics. That’s a number that is unthinkable. We even have our Navy, our ships are now in the Gulf and in the Pacific getting it, because when we closed up the border, they went by water. Okay? They don’t miss a trick. They’re very smart, but we’re seizing tremendous amounts in the ocean and in the Gulf. Working with Colombian officials, we’ve also seized or disrupted 227 tons of poisonous narcotics since April. That’s just since April. And then Joe Biden goes out and says the other day that America is nothing more than an idea. No. America is a great country. That’s what it is. It’s not an idea. It’s a great country. And you can’t have a great country unless you have borders, unless you have borders. We invested $2.5 trillion in the U.S. military, all made in the USA, much of it in New Hampshire. And we have weaponry, missiles, rockets, tanks, planes, tankers, submarines, submarines. We have weapons. We’re the envy of the world, Russia, China, North Korea. We’re the envy of the world and they all know it. Our nuclear plants are all brought back to perfect condition, or new, and just hope to God we never have to use it. But you know what? It’s going to be far less likely to use when we have it. But it’s all been brought back. We have the greatest weapons, the hydrosonic missiles that go seven times faster than a normal, very fast missile. We have the greatest equipment. We’re the envy of the world and hopefully, hope to God, we don’t have to use it. We passed big veteran area. Where’s big Al? Where’s Al? I used to love that guy. We passed VA Choice and VA Accountability. We got it done. Right? We got it done. So now instead of waiting online for weeks and weeks and days and days, we have your VA choice. You go to a doctor. You get yourself taken care of. We pay the bill. And it’s just been a great thing. We just got a 91% approval rating from the vets. The highest we’ve ever had by a lot. How’s Al? Is he around? Where’s Al? Where’s Al? Where is Al? Al, did I do a good job with the vets? Look at him. Al was great. Al was so depressed when I first started running. I saw him. I just liked him. A big vet, he headed up some groups, and he was telling me how badly the vets were treated. So Al, we got 91% approval rating from the vets. Thank you, Al. And I hope you’re feeling good. You’re feeling all right, right? He went through a lot. We killed the leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi. We killed him. Took out 100% of the ISIS caliphate. And we took out the mass murderer of American troops and many others, Soleimani is dead. The both of them, dead. Worst terrorists. I withdrew from the last administration’s disastrous Iran nuclear deal, $150 billion, $1.8 billion in cash, I withdrew. That deal was nothing. And by the way, the first call I get if we win, will be from the leaders of Iran. They want to make a deal because their country is going to hell with the sanctions. They’re down 26 or 27% in GDP, which I think is a record also. I recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. And instead of never ending wars, we are forging peace in the Middle East. No more blood on the sand. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans. Do me a favor. Vote for your Senator, please. He’s going to be such a great Senator. I don’t know. It’s probably a tough race, but you should vote. He will be fantastic. He’s what we need. And in conclusion, I want to just say this. A vote for Republicans is really a vote for the American dream because we’re about the American dream. And in conclusion, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world, and we will end our reliance on China once and for all. It’s already happening. It’s already happening. That’s already happened. We will hire more police. We love our police. Increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement. And we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms. And we’re giving you a great new Supreme Court Justice, by the way. That’ll take place on Monday. The Democrats are thrilled. Monday. Three of them, all great. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. That’s what we have. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency, already signed and done. Goes into effect on January 1st. Lower drug prices, Favored Nations, lowest prices in the world. I’m instituting Favored Nations. The drug companies do not love me too much. They’re taken more ads than anybody’s ever taken, but that’s okay. People understand. And we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. Always. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, In God We Trust. For years, you had a President who apologized for America, now you have a President who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of New Hampshire. I’m standing up. For the last four years you’ve seen me fight for you, and now I’m relying on you to deliver another historic victory for our country. Get your friends. Get your family. Get your neighbors. Get your coworkers, even get your bosses. Say, “Boss, you got to come with me,” and get out and vote. You got to get out and vote. From Nashua to Dixville, from Portsmouth to Plymouth, from Concord to Claremont, and from Meredith to right here in Manchester, I like Manchester. We inherit the legacy of red-blooded New Hampshire Patriots who live by that immortal motto, Live Free or Die. Live Free or Die. That’s probably about as good as it gets, right? That’s good. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who cross our oceans, settle the continent, tame the wilderness, lay down the railroads, raise up the skyscrapers, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And the best is yet to come. The best is yet to come. Proud citizens like you help build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. It’s happening very quickly. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we’re going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of New Hampshire, we have made America powerful again, our military. We have made America wealthy again, our stock market, 401(k)s. How are your 401(k)s doing? We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again. We have made America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, New Hampshire. Thank you. Thank you. Go vote.

"97","10-26-20","Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Thank you very much. Distinguished guests and my fellow citizens, this is a momentous day for America, for the United States Constitution and for the fair and impartial rule of law. The Constitution is the ultimate defense of American liberty. The faithful application of the law is the cornerstone of our republic. That is why as President, I have no more solemn obligation and no greater honor than to appoint Supreme Court Justices. On this October evening, and it is so beautiful, the First Lady and I welcome you to the White House to bear witness to history. In a few moments, we will proudly swear in the newest member of the United States Supreme Court, Justice Amy Coney Barrett. She was one of our nation’s most brilliant legal scholars, and she will make an outstanding justice on the highest court in our land. Justice Barrett’s oath will be administered by the court’s longest serving member currently on the bench, a man whose allegiance to the law has earned him the respect and gratitude of all Americans, Justice Clarence Thomas. Our country owes a great debt of thanks to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. We appreciate it very much, Mitch. Thank you. And we are grateful as well to the Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsay Graham. Thank you, Lindsey. Also with us, Senators Marsha Blackburn, Mike Braun, Bill Cassidy, Kevin Cramer, Ted Cruz, Steve Daines, Ron Johnson, James Lankford, Mike Lee, and Martha McSally. And I hope I didn’t leave anybody out. And a very special thanks to our great Vice President, Mike Pence. Thank you, Mike. Also, I want to thank White House Counsel, Pat Cipollone. Thank you, Pat. And very importantly, I want to welcome Justice Barrett’s husband, Jesse. Thank you, Jesse. Thank you. Let me also recognize your seven children, your great, beautiful children who have become really just very, very popular in this nation. People have been watching them and loving them and they’re watching right now back home in Indiana. Thank you very much. And I speak to everyone when I say that the Barrett family is captured America’s heart. It is highly fitting that Justice Barrett fills the seat of a true pioneer for women, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Tonight, Justice Barrett becomes not only the fifth women to serve on our nation’s highest court, but the very first mother of school-aged children to become a Supreme Court Justice. Very important. Over the past few weeks, the entire world has seen Justice Barrett’s deep knowledge, tremendous poise, and towering intellect. She answered questions for hours on end. Throughout her entire confirmation, her impeccable credentials were unquestioned, unchallenged, and obvious to all. Justice Barrett earned a full academic scholarship to Notre Dame Law School, graduated first in her class and served as a clerk for Justice Antonin Scalia. She was a beloved professor at Notre Dame Law School for 15 years before I very proudly appointed her to the US Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in 2017. The American people have been profoundly impressed to learn of her achievements, her compassion, her generosity, her faith, and her sterling character. Justice Barrett made clear she will issue rulings based solely upon a faithful reading of the law and the Constitution as written, not legislate from the bench. The equal, impartial and constitutional rule of law that we enjoy every day in America is one of the crowning achievements in the history of human civilization. It is the triumph of reason, experience, and the values which are eternal and everlasting. Our devotion to this inheritance is what has made America the most just, exceptional, and glorious nation ever to exist. I want to every American child watching to understand that this is a very special and important ceremony. We are fulfilling the duty that passes to each new generation to sustained the national traditions and virtues that make possible everything we have achieved before that we will do tomorrow. Because of our Constitution and our culture of freedom, you live in a land where anything is possible and where any dream can come true. No matter who you are, no matter your background, in America everyone is entitled to equal protection under our laws, and your sacred rights can never, ever be taken away. The march of liberty that began with the American Revolution continues onward this evening. Tonight at the White House, we carry forward the cause of freedom, equality, and justice for which so many generations of Americans have given so much. We honor the cause for which men died to win the Civil War and for which they jumped out of airplanes and shed their blood on distant battlefields. We honor the immortal principles, inspired millions in the struggle for Civil Rights. And we take special pride in the nation that inspires billions of people all over the world. We must never take this radiant inheritance for granted. We must never lose confidence in our history, our heritage, or in our heroes. To reach for the stars, we must stand upon the strong and sturdy foundation built by those incredible Americans who came before. Justice Barrett, as you take your oath tonight, the legacy of our ancestors falls to you. The American people put their trust in you and their faith in you, as you take up the task of defending our laws, our Constitution, and this country that we all love. We ask God to give you wisdom and courage. I know you will make us all very, very proud. As long as we are loyal to our founding and to our fellow citizens, America’s future will be bright. America’s destiny will be great and America’s people will forever and always be free. I now ask Justice Thomas to administer the oath. Thank you very much.

"98","10-27-20","Thank you. That’s a lot of people. That’s a lot of people. Look at that. That’s incredible. I hope the fake news media is turning their cameras way, way back there. That’s incredible. Hello, Omaha. And I have to also say, because a lot of people are here from Iowa. Hello, Iowa. Okay. Wait a minute. Who’s from Iowa? Raise, go. Who’s from Omaha? You know what? We’re going to be in Iowa soon. We’ll do that one separately. That’s a big difference. Seven days from now, we’re going to win Nebraska, and we’re going to win four more years in the great White House. That’s beautiful, beautiful White House. This is… Look at this. I can’t believe this. 29,000 people can you believe it? 29,000. You know, we have to win both Nebraska’s, you know that right? You have two, you’re cut. We’re going to win both. This election is a choice between the Trump super recovery, which is what we’re having, or a Biden depression, sad to say. And some bad news just came out on Biden. But I won’t tell you about that. You’ll find that out tomorrow. Look at you. Man, that’s something. Biden has pledged the biggest tax hike in the history of our country. First man, that I’ve ever seen campaign on the fact, “I’m going to raise your taxes.” What’s going on? I gave working families, record-setting tax cuts, and in my second term, I will cut middle class taxes, very substantially more. By the way, a lot of things are going on. You’re seeing those poll numbers, they’re going through the roof. I hate to tell. Where is the fake news? It’s over there? Oh, that’s a lot of cameras. No, it’s going up. They’re very concerned. They’re very, very concerned. All over. Florida is looking great. Now, Nebraska we know is looking great. Okay? I mean, in theory, I didn’t really have to be here, but it’s nice to be with your friends. With your vote we will continue to bring back our jobs, support our police, defend our second amendment, which is under siege, secure our borders, maintain American energy independence, expand school choice, and ensure more products are proudly stamped with the phrase, that beautiful phrase, beautiful phrase, made in the USA, right? I will deliver record prosperity, epic job growth, and a safe vaccine that eradicates the virus and quickly ends the pandemic. We’re making that final turn. They don’t want to hear it. We’re making that turn. You know that right? We’re going to have the vaccine anyway with, or without it, we’re making the turn. Normal life will fully resume. That’s all we want. We want normal life, normal life, go back seven months, we’ll take normal life, greatest economy we ever had. We want normal life and next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country. That’s where we’re heading. Super V. Joe Biden doesn’t even respect you enough to campaign. He never came here, right? Did he come here? Oh. All right, so that’s the end of that. I’ll see you guys, I don’t have… Moments ago, we learned about the other reason Joe Biden has been hiding in his basement, in a national television interview… Do you want me to tell you the rest? The Biden family’s business partner revealed shocking, disturbing, and explosive information about Joe Biden’s corrupt and illicit foreign business dealings while he was Vice President. The business partner made clear that Biden’s denial of involvement in his son’s corrupt business dealings was a blatant lie with proof. He stated with firsthand knowledge, that Vice President Biden was directly and personally involved in establishing corrupt business dealings with China and getting money for it. This all happened at the same time as Biden was letting China steal American jobs and plunder American wealth. You saw that for eight years. If Biden wins, China wins, and China will own the USA. If Biden wins he will do bad things. By the way, he’s not a good guy. Just so you understand. Is there any place you would rather be than a Trump rally on about a 10 degree evening? 10 degrees. Yeah, it’s cold out here, but that’s okay. You know, we just left Wisconsin? It was cold. And we left Michigan, it was cold and raining. And I said, “I won’t put on a hat because I’m going to show you how tough we are.” That was a tough one. It was pouring. It was pouring and it was freezing. And it’s the coldest right here. Right? It’s a little later. It’s an honor to be with you I have to say. When we win, you win, Nebraska wins, and all of America wins, and that’s the way we want it. Joe Biden has spent the last 47 years, think of it, 47. 47 years outsourcing your jobs, opening your borders, and sacrificing American blood and treasure in endless foreign, ridiculous wars. Countries you’ve never even heard of. In 2016, Nebraska voted to fire this corrupt political establishment, and you elected an outsider as president who finally put America first. And if I don’t sound like a typical Washington politician it’s because I’m not a politician. If I don’t always play by the rules of the Washington establishment, it’s because I was elected to fight for you. And I fought harder for you than any president who’s ever held this wonderful, beautiful office. That I can tell you. This election is a matter of economic survival for Omaha and for communities all across our country. Joe Biden’s agenda, and I’m not sure it’s only Biden’s agenda, let’s face it. It’s not his agenda. It sounds nice, Biden’s agenda. The guys shot. He’s shot. He’s so gonzo. You saw him yesterday, they took him away. I was in Pennsylvania with these tremendous, crowds like this, tremendous rallies; and he had the lid on, right? You know, the lid, like from a garbage can, they call it the lid. They saw what was happening, because I went to three of them. I did three of them yesterday in Pennsylvania. So he went from Delaware to the closest point where Pennsylvania hits Delaware, which was about five minutes away from his basement. He made a speech, just before that he called me George. He said, “George,” I think he was talking about Georgia. His wife was sitting next to him and you could see she was not happy. But it’s hard to correct him, the camera’s on, but he called me George. Then he did the little speech and it wasn’t good. They sort of just moved him out. They took him away, his own people, brush him off. They took them off stage. This is not what you can have. We have the greatest country in the world. We have more potential than any country in the world. We can’t play games. We can’t play games. So the Democrats, let’s say the Democrats, the radical left Democrats, they have an extreme agenda. He’s just a vehicle. He’ll be there for about four weeks or so. Then you’ll have Kamala, Kamala. That will not be the first woman president. You’re going to have a woman president, maybe soon, maybe soon, but you’re not going to have a Kamala. Can’t be Kamala. She’s further left by far then crazy Bernie. Bernie is like a conservative compared to her, but Biden’s extreme agenda includes a radical vision to destroy suburbs across our nation. How are your suburbs doing? Don’t ask. Are they good? They won’t be good for longer, if they get it. And to completely dismantle law enforcement and cripple police departments nationwide, you know what’s going on. You see it better than anybody. You don’t have to take my word for it. Biden’s plan to destroy suburbs and police just take a look, roll the tape. We do this view on this freezing cold night. The prior administration piled up more than 600 major new regulations, a cruel and punishing regulatory burden that cost the average American an additional $2,300 per year. Think of that. The average American, $2,300, regulation, hitting low-income Americans by far the hardest. Our historic regulatory relief is providing the average American household an extra $3,100 every single year. I will cut taxes even further for hard working moms and dads. I will not raise taxes. I will cut them. Thank you. Thank you very much. Well, that’s pretty effective. You know what that costs to bring to you tonight? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Pretty effective, right? You see it. It saves me a lot of words. I can sit here, watch. I say, “See?” No, he’s not the right guy. He’s not the right guy. He’s not right for this country. He’s not the guy for this country. This election is a choice between the American dream, which is what we want and a socialist nightmare, which is where you would head if you ever did that, which I don’t believe you’ll do. It’s a choice between a Trump boom and a Biden lockdown. He wants to lock it all down. No. We closed it up. We understand the disease. It’s a terrible thing. Should never have been allowed to come here from China. Should never have been allowed. Joe Biden will delay the vaccine, postpone therapies, prolong the pandemic, shutter your schools, right? Shutter your schools, destroy your small businesses and shut down our country. We’re not doing that. Look, we are setting records, 11.4 million people. It’s all opened up. We understand it. And we are doing a job. We are literally setting records on employment. Look at housing, look at automobile production. Look at how you’re doing in Nebraska. Look at how you’re doing in Nebraska. Biden even wants to lock down young and healthy Americans yet for those under the age of 50, I hate to say this, under the age of 50. How many are under the age of 50? Pretty young. Well, I have good news for you. 99.99, okay, you know what that means? That means you’re in good shape. That’s what that means. But you notice the fake news now, right? All they talk about is COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID and we’ve made such progress. It’s incredible. Excuse me. I’m here. Right? I’m here. Right? I mean, I wasn’t exactly feeling great. It’s been a long time. I wasn’t exactly feeling great. Man, I met with great doctors. One thing when you’re president, you got plenty of doctors. We have one of them here tonight, I think. Right? We have our great White House doctors traveling. Sean, he’s become very famous. Where is Sean? He’s become … Oh, is that Sean. Look at Sean. Look at him. Wow. You know, he’s got a big ego. He loves it when I mention his name. No, he’s a great doctor. They were great doctors from Johns Hopkins and from Walter Reed and everything else. And what we know today is like so different than what we knew six months ago. Incredible. The progress they’ve made and with the vaccines, which are coming immediately, even without, we’re turning that corner. You know, at some point we’re turning that corner and it’s been pretty amazing. Florida had a rough time. Boom, it stepped back. It’s all the way down. Texas, all the way down. Arizona, great governors, all the way down. Biden’s cruel and senseless lock downs would cause countless deaths from suicide, drug overdose and delayed medical care, alcohol. I’ve been so many, so many different problems. Remember, I’d say the cure can not be worse than the problem itself. That’s what you have. When I banned traveled from China, remember he said now. He says, “Oh, we should have done it sooner.” Except when I banned it. For two and a half months, he said he shouldn’t do that. He’s xenophobic. Right? And now he says, “Oh, I should’ve done it earlier.” And he had a thing called the swine flu. It was a disaster, much less lethal. It was a disaster. He was a disaster. He’s still a disaster actually. If we listen to Joe, countless more people would have died. They were anticipating it could be 2.2 million. You don’t hear that, 2.2 million. And you know the number. It’s still one is too many as far as I’m concerned. One is too many. It shouldn’t have happened. One is too many, but it could have been 2.2. It could have been more than that. Biden was willing to sacrifice your lives on the altar of open borders. He wants open borders. Without borders, you don’t have a country. By the way, the wall is now over 400 miles long and we’re building 10 miles a week and it’s very soon going to be finished. So we have the strongest southern border we’ve ever had. And we want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally and they have to come in through Marin. Marin. Biden has no plan, no idea, no clue. He has no clue. That’s for sure. And he just wants to lock up and throw away the keys, letting rioters and looters run wild. And you know, it’s interesting. They call them peaceful protestors. They burn down your cities. They do things that nobody’s seen before all in radical left Democrat run cities and states, but cities, all of them, all of them. And every time we go in, we were going to go into Seattle. We let them know we’re coming in. The night before we came in, they gave up, they left. They took over a piece of Seattle. That wasn’t going to last. Minneapolis, the same thing. We went into Minneapolis. We went in, you know, we have to be asked in theory, by the state. We went into Minneapolis and it all ended. It took about, what do you think? 25 minutes or so. It was just boom, right down the street. Now, the Republican run cities are doing very well. The Republican run cities. And I hope you agree because I know he’s here, but you have a very good Republican governor. You do know that, yeah? Whoa. Listen to that. Good. Good. Hi, Pete. Good. You know, I’m glad they did that. You know, I want to do the … Otherwise, I just wouldn’t introduce you later. You know, keep it quiet. They like you, Pete. The Biden plan will crush you and crush your family. My plan will crush the virus and you will see economic benefits like we’ve never seen in our country before. That’s what we’re having. When the China plague arrived, we moved heaven and earth to fight the disease. We airlifted medical supplies, pioneered groundbreaking therapies, reduced the fatality rate 85%. Think of that and saved over two million lives. Our excess mortality rate has been 42% less than Europe. You hear about Europe, 42% less, much better than Europe. I’m working to make the breakthrough treatment that I received. I did. I had this thing called Regeneron. I don’t know. I’d like to say it had nothing to do. I’d like to say my immune system is just like Baron Trump. You know, first lady had it. I had it. Baron had it. They said, “Sir, Baron has tested positive.” Like 12 minutes later, I said, “How’s Baron doing?” “Oh, he’s okay now, sir. He threw it away.” He just took that, threw it away, you know? They’re young and they have strong immune systems, but I’d like to say the treatment didn’t do anything for me. Doctor, do you hear that? I just threw it away like Baron. But you know what? I wasn’t going to take my chance. I said, “You have something, give it to me.” And it was effective because I woke up the next morning after being with these doctors, they wanted to touch every single part of your body and I didn’t like it. Twelve of them. Each one was a specialist, right? Every single one, but they were great. No, they were great. But I woke up the next morning and I tell you, I felt like, “Get me out of here. It was amazing.” So, I really think this thing was great. It’s great. I think it was great. And you know, I don’t have the luxury of staying in a basement. I’m president of the United States. I don’t. I can’t be staying. I really can’t. You can’t stay. I had a lot of meetings. I meet a lot of people. As president, I have that obligation. So we have basements in the White House I could stay. We have beautiful bedrooms upstairs at the White House I could stay for a year and a half. I can’t do that. I have to be working for you. And if something happens, it happens. And I get, you know, they came in, they said, “Sir, you’ve tested positive.” I said, “Tested positive for what?” Then you go into one of the 27 different names, corona, this, this, this, China virus, the China plague, the China plague. That’s what I tested positive for. But it was amazing. And it was actually an experience. And until I came along, you were supposed to have lifetime immunity. Right? I said, “Well, I’m recovered. I feel great. And I’m immune.” I could jump right into this road. I could kiss every man and woman, every man and woman. But because it was me, the press said, “No, it’s not for a lifetime. It’s only for four months. Immunity is only now for four months.” They brought it down, right? It was always going to be for a lifetime, now it’s four months. So what are you going to do? What are you going to do? It’s one of those things, but I guarantee you this. On November 4th, you won’t be hearing as much about this. It’s going to be … right now, it’s, COVID, COVID, COVID no matter what happens. COVID, COVID. And on November 4th, you’ll probably try and find some information about it. No, we’re rounding the turn. We’re rounding that beautiful turn and it’s going to be very good. The vaccines all going to make it go away a lot faster and they’re going to be great. The greatest companies, the greatest companies of their kind in the world, they’re doing it. Really good. Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, they really are great. Pfizer. Thanks to our relentless efforts, 97% of all current emergency room visits are for something other than the virus. Think of that, 97%. We’re in great shape. And in the one areas, the Midwest, a little areas in the Midwest, certain areas that are heated up right now, they’ll go down. They’ll go down very quickly. There’ll be down within two weeks they’re figuring. They’ll go down just like they did in Florida, Texas, Arizona and so many others. We’re on track to deliver 100 million doses of a safe vaccine and a great vaccine. And that’s all set. We’re all set logistically. Our military is going to deliver it. It’ll be done very quickly. We will vanquish the vaccine and we will get rid of this whole thing. We will get rid of this virus. It’ll be very, you watch, it’s going to happen very quickly and we’re going to have our country back. And the whole world is going to be coming back. This was a terrible, terrible thing that happened, terrible thing that happened. Terrible thing that happened. Joe Biden has made a corrupt bargain, in exchange for his party’s nomination he has handed control of his party over to the rage filled socialist, Marxists, and left wing extremists. And could we put another name in there? Starts with a C, communist, yes. No, we got a couple of them too, unfortunately. If Biden wins, the flag burning extremists on the streets will be running your government, it’s not going to happen. By the way, just so you know, we are so far… You listen to the fakers back there, look at them. You listen to the fake news, we are so far ahead, this is going to be bigger than four years ago. By the way, get out and vote, that the only thing I’m standing here freezing, I ask you one little favor, get that hell out and vote. The great red wave. At least you’re down there with each other, I’m all up here and that wind is blowing. This election day you must stop the anti-American radicals and, really, I mean, that’s what they are, they’re radicals. We can solve these problems so quickly if the governments would just say, “Would you please come in federal government?” We’d stop it in a matter of minutes, it goes so fast. The radical’s delivering Joe Biden, you have to do this, you have to deliver them a message, the far left, a thundering defeat at the ballot box on November 3rd. It’s got to be a big one, we’ve got to win big. And we’re going to win big, I watching them and they’re getting… Like three weeks ago, I don’t know, they were doing these fake polls and they felt very good. And then a week ago they were feeling okay, they’re not feeling so good right now. They’re saying, “These are not good numbers.” Was that one of the greatest evenings ever four years ago? And you know, the difference is, and I say this is easier, there’s more… Look at this crowd, I mean, we had big crowds, we didn’t have crowds like this. Look at this crowd 29,000. You have 29, 000 people in Omaha, that’s pretty good. And you’re all on television. Say, “Hello.” You’re on national television. See all the red lights? That means the cameras are going, that means those cameras are going. 29,000 people, they say, 29,000. Yeah. You know who spoke today? President Barack Hussein Obama. He had 12 people in seven cars, did you hear the… No, he draws flies. I’ve never seen… He draws… He had no people, I thought he’d have some people. And he bought Bon Jovi along, you know what happened to Bon Jovi? They increased the crowd by 22 people, can you believe that? And then Joe spoke and that crowd left and we have 29,000 people here and we had a tremendous crowd in Michigan, had a tremendous crowd in Wisconsin. And they’re trying to figure out like, if Trump is getting these crowds and if Biden’s getting like 12 people, you know the circles, he fills in the circles, they got like five of them. And a lot of times they put reporters in there cause they have no people. But today he tried to blame that on COVID also. He said, “No, no, we don’t seek large crowds,” because of the virus, right? They don’t want the large crowd. That’s not the reason, okay? That’s not the reason. It’s a hell of an excuse, but it’s not the reason. We’re thrilled to be joined by the man we were just talking about, he’s a friend of mine, he loves his state, he loves his country and he’s a great governor, Pete Ricketts. Pete, Great job. Great job. What a good guy. What a good man. How’s your state doing, Pete? All right, good. How are we doing? By the way, we’re going to be okay here, right? He says, “Good.” Good, thank you very much, Pete. And his brother Todd, another one really good. Now there’s only two people that are better, Joe and Marlene. Now Todd is great, but they will both admit Joe and Marlene are better, right? And you’re here. Hi Joe. I like the hat, Hi Joe. You got to be proud of your boys, they’re doing a great job, thank you very much. Thank you very much, great family. Here as well are Senators, Deb Fischer, who’s fantastic. She is my favorite Senator from the State of Nebraska, by far, by far. She’s fantastic. She is. I’ll tell you what she calls me, it doesn’t stop. Between her and Joni Ernst from Iowa, who I think is here, where’s Joni? Joni. Joni. They call, “Sir, we need help with ethanol. Sir, we need help with corn. We need…” It’s always… But you know what? That’s what a great Senator, that’s what a great Representative is supposed to do, right? Joni, thank you very much. And I heard you doing very well, I just saw some very nice numbers. And Deb, you don’t have to worry about numbers, right? You don’t have to worry about numbers. I’m with you all the time. Thank you both. And yeah, it looks very good in Iowa. Thank you very much. Good. Add Representatives, Jeff Fortenberry, a warrior, where’s Jeff? Thank you, Jeff. Great guy. Don Bacon. Whoa, what’s this? Wow. Wow. Well, I like him too, but I don’t know if I like him that much. That’s very good. I’ll tell you, you better get me on Omaha, you understand that? Now I know, I wouldn’t have asked him, but now I’m going to say, “Make sure we win this side too,” right? Good. How are we doing Don, I hear good. Good, huh? Good. I’m very impressed, that’s about as good as I’ve heard in a long time. And Adrian Smith. Adrian, great job. Great job. Great to have you here. It’s a great group of people and these are warriors, they fought with me a lot. They fought with me, we keep winning over there, but it’s not easy, right? But it gets easier and easier all the time. Thank you very much, I appreciate it. For decades, our politicians spent trillions and trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign Wars, and defending foreign borders, but now we are finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities and we are bringing our jobs, our factories, and our troops back home to the USA. Our troops are coming home. Thank you. No, our troops are coming back home, that’s enough. 19 years in Afghanistan and we have it worked in they’re coming home and it’s a great thing. And they’re home from Syria, they’re home, I left some because we kept the oil, if you don’t mind, there was some oil and we captured it, we kept it. And coming home from Iraq. It’s enough, it’s enough, we want to have them all home. We have a lot of other countries too, we were in many, many, many countries, most of which you’ve never even heard of, right? You never even heard of, it’s ridiculous. And, by the way, making our military stronger by far than ever before. I ended the NAFTA nightmare and proudly signed the brand new USMCA, which is turning out to be phenomenal, it’s a great deal. It’s a great deal, just kicked in now. And you know what? Companies will not be leaving Nebraska and Iowa and all of our places, there is a very big disincentive for them to do that. When China targeted our farmers, I delivered $28 billion to our incredible farmers here in Nebraska, and Iowa, and all across the country. Don’t forget to tell the people of Iowa that, please. $28 billion, I said to the Secretary, Sonny Perdue, of Agriculture. Sonny is great. I said, “Sonny, how much were the farmers targeted?” And he said, “$12 billion, sir and $16 billion,” two years, 12 and 16. I said, “28, good.” So I tariffed $28 billion, took it from China and distributed it to our farmers, nobody else is going to do that. In fact, some people say our farmers do better now than they did when they actually had to farm. But we did, we had the biggest order of corn two weeks ago in the history of our country, the biggest order of soybeans, and the biggest beef order, right? Two weeks ago. Joe Biden’s running mate, the most liberal member of the US Senate, you know who that is, sponsors the insane Green New Deal, $100 trillion, you too can have no windows in your buildings. Which would wipe out the ethanol industry, Joni, it would totally wipe out that industry. We worked hard on that industry and then now in good shape. Devastating Nebraska and devastating Iowa, as president I will always defend ethanol, okay? All right? Does Nebraska like ethanol too, by the way? Okay good, I need that little assurance. I need that little bit of assurance. Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure border in us history, our Southern border, largely because of the wall. My opponent’s insane immigration plan would completely eliminate US borders. Open borders they want to have, let’s have open borders so everyone can just pour it like they used to. He would make every community into a sanctuary city for violent criminals. So we invested $2.5 trillion, a lot of it right here from this state and from Joni, from Iowa, $2.5 trillion, new equipment, our military is in the best shape it’s ever been in, we have the greatest equipment anywhere in the world. We are the envy of every other country: Russia, China, North Korea. We have the best missiles, and rockets, and tanks, and planes, and fighter jets, F-35s, submarines, and our nuclear weapons are now renovated and/or new and fixed, and we only hope to God we never have to use them. Hope to God. Our military was very much in bad shape. It was depleted. It was depleted. It was exhausted, it was ridiculous. We killed the leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi, they were looking for him for a long time. And we took out the world’s top terrorist, Soleimani is dead. I withdrew from the last administration’s disastrous and ridiculous Iran Nuclear Deal, $150 billion we paid, for nothing. And $1.8 billion in cash, I’m more impressed with that. What do you think, pop? I think I’m more impressed, $ 150 billion or $1.8 billion in cash, I think I’m more impressed with the cash. You ever hear everything like that? That’s what we gave to Iran for nothing, we got nothing. I recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem. And I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, think on that. They kept that they worked on that for 52 years, I got it done in two hours. And instead of never ending Wars in the Middle East, you see what’s happening, already three countries, we have five lined up and we’re going to have another, it’s going to be… it’s an easy one, it’s a lot easier than you would think. They worked on this for 35 years, they had the wrong people, they had the wrong concepts. But I got nominated for three Nobel Peace Prizes, can you believe it? Can you believe it? And for all different regions, like Kosovo and Serbia were doing deals, trade deals, just normally we’re doing trade deals, I said, “Wait a minute, aren’t they always fighting each other?” ""Yeah."" ""Aren't they always killing each other?"" “Yeah, for many decades, sir, how did you know?” I said, “I know, they’re killing… They fight each other all the time. Tell him we’re not going to do any business with them. They want our business, right? And we’re not going to do any business unless we make a deal where they stop killing each other.” And you know what? It took about 20 minutes. They’ve been fighting for 40 years, I think they’d been fighting for 400 years, you want to know the truth, but they’ve been fighting for a long time. They want to make a deal. All of a sudden, two months ago, they’re in the Oval Office hugging and kissing and [inaudible 00:00:14]. That was easy, Joe. Right? That was easy. It just makes sense. I just said, “Hey, why don’t we get them together? I mean, we’re going to do these two deals. Tell them to stop fighting, and we save a lot of lives. That’s a good thing.” But we’re forging peace in the Middle East without blood all over the sand, and we’re not spending money. You’re doing it either… Something very nice is we’re pulling out. A vote for Republicans is a vote for the American dream. It’s a vote for acknowledgement that Abraham Lincoln was a Republican. Is that nice? People don’t know that. A lot of people don’t know that. So in conclusion, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world, and we will end our reliance on China. And that’s already begun, largely already begun. We will hire more police, increased penalties for assaults on law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. We will defend religious liberty, free speech, the right to life, and the right to keep and bear arms. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. And that’s what we have now, with what we have. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency. That’s bigger than healthcare. You watch. Already signed, kicks in on January 1st. Lower drug prices even more. We signed favored nations. That means we’re going to get the lowest price anywhere in the world. Right now, we’re by far the highest. And we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. America will land the first woman on the moon, and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. And NASA is the number one space center anywhere in the world again. It was a mess three and a half years ago. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students, and restore patriotic education to our school. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, “In God We Trust.” For years, you had a president who apologized to America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America, and standing up for the great people of Nebraska and Iowa. So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, and get your coworkers. Get your boss and say, “Boss, get out of here, boss. Get out and vote. You got to vote.” The red wave is coming. The great red wave. Now we’re doing very well. Those early ballots…You know the whole ballot hoax. You see what’s going on. There’s so many bad things happening, but we’re doing very well. You know, we’re supposed to be a little behind, and they were a little bit above. But that wave comes, and now we go to the front of everything. I think we’re going to win everything. We didn’t come this far and fight this hard to surrender our country back to the corrupt Washington swamp. So on November 3rd, we must finish the job that we started. We have done a job like nobody. There has been no administration, nobody, and it’s us all together. There has been… No administration has done in the first three and a half years what this administration has done. Not even close. Not even close. Not even close. From Norfolk to Hastings, from Grand Island to Lincoln, and from Scottsbluff to right here in Omaha, we inherit the legacy of Nebraska patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for this beloved nation. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the ocean, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, laid down the railroads, raised up the great skyscrapers, won two World Wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And the best is yet to come. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together, we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We’re going to keep on fighting, and we’re going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God, and together with the incredible people of Nebraska and Iowa, we have made America powerful again. We have made America wealthy again. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again. We have made America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you Nebraska. Thank you Iowa. Thank you both. Thank you. Get out and vote.

"99","10-28-20","Wow. Thank you very much. And hello, Goodyear. Hello, Phoenix. Six days, can you believe this? Six days from now we are going to win Arizona and we are going to win four more years in our great, beautiful White House. A vote for me is a vote for massive tax cuts, regulation cuts, fair trade, strong borders, our Second Amendment, we will save our Second Amendment, and American energy independence. It’s a vote to support our police, our military, stand up to China, which we’ve been doing. They gave $28 billion to our farmers. That’s very nice. Thank you very much, China. And ensure more products that are proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase, “Made in the U.S.A.” We will deliver record prosperity, epic job growth, and a safe vaccine that eradicates the virus, the China Plague is what it is, and quickly end the pandemic. Normal life, which is what we want, we just want normal life, like we had seven months ago. We’ll fully resume, and next year we will be the greatest economic power. We are going to be stronger than we’ve ever been before. And you see that all happening. Next year will be the best economic year in our country’s history. And last year was, and then we were interrupted. We were interrupted. It’s called Make America Great Again, Again. A vote for Joe Biden, Sleepy Joe, is a vote for the biggest tax hike in history. I’ve never seen this before, a man who’s campaigning on the fact that he’s going to raise your taxes. I have seen. They’re going to crush, regulations, it will be crushing. You have no idea what they want to do. We’ve took off more regulations than any administration in the history of our country. They are going to put those regulations back, and all they do is cause waste and a lot of other problems, slash Medicare and social security, and they want to abolish American energy. You know what he said, “No fracking.” He said, “No fracking.” Until he went to Pennsylvania, then he said, “Maybe we can frack.” His people won’t let them frack and Joe doesn’t have any clue where he is. You know that. “Where am I? Where am I? What state am I in?” He’s only got it wrong about seven times. “Where am I? Is this Arizona or is this Nevada? Where am I? Tell me, where am I? Is this Iowa? Oh, oh, oh, oh, it’s very hot. I know where I am. This is Florida, isn’t it?” “No, Joe. No Joe.” A vote for Biden is a vote for open borders, offshoring jobs, shredding the Second Amendment, confiscating your guns, and eliminating private healthcare. 180 million people on private healthcare. It’s called bye-bye. And they love their private healthcare. Biden and the Democrat socialists will delay the vaccine, prolong the pandemic, shutter your schools and shut down our country. And your state is open, right? Your state is nice and open. Your state is nice and open. Thank you. Your Governor did a good job. I don’t know if you appreciate it, but he did a good job. You had a spike, and he just did what he had to do. And your state is fully open. Good job. He may be here. He may be in this crowd of about 25,000 people. He may be here. I may get lucky and introduce them in a little while. He is here. He’s a great Governor. This election is a choice between the American dream and a socialist nightmare. As long as I am President, America will never, ever be a socialist country. I am fighting for the dreams of all Americans, including millions of truly amazing, and they like me, my poll numbers are through the roof with, Hispanic Americans, right? Through the roof. I always knew they liked me. It’s a big story. They say, “What’s going on?” I just saw it. “What’s going on with Trump and the Hispanics? What’s going on with Trump? His poll numbers.” They’re getting very nervous. Our poll numbers are looking very good. We had one little upset this morning. We’re doing very well in Wisconsin, right? I was there yesterday. We had 25,000 people at least. And I will tell you, it was cold. I did three of these yesterday. Don’t make me cry. Don’t make me cry. They’ll say, “The president was crying.” I don’t know. I don’t know if I want a President that cries. But it’s okay. But that’s the phrase, one of the greatest men in the country right here, did you ever hear that phrase before? I don’t think so. Oh, we have Mike Lee here too. And we have Rand Paul here and Sergio, and the King of Europe we have right here. Rand, did you ever hear that phrase for a politician? Rand would like that phrase, I can tell you right now. So we’ve got some great polls and we are getting great polls. We are doing great in Florida. Doing great in North Carolina. Doing great I think in Pennsylvania, I think. I think it’s going to be great. We won it last time. First time in many years, a Republican won. We’ve done good. Brought a lot of business there. They had a lot of business went back to Pennsylvania, so I think they appreciate it, but haven’t seen the numbers. They vote late. They vote on Tuesday. That’s what they like. I like that too. But we’re doing good all over. We’re doing good in Wisconsin. We have a poll. We’re one up in Wisconsin. Don’t clap yet. Today, the fake Washington Post, ABC, you’d think they come out that he’s four down, he’s five down. “17 down in Wisconsin.” I don’t think so. I had the same fraudsters here four years ago, they had me 12 down a week before the election, right? Remember that, I was 12 down? ABC, Washington Post, I mean, just dishonest people. And we sent them a legal letter and by the time we got to the election, we were even. I wonder what happened. But they interviewed slightly more Democrats and Republicans. We looked at it. I think there’s some kind of a law that you have to do that. They interviewed a few more, a number that you wouldn’t even believe. I agree. I agree. I agree. But they’re all in that bag. ABC, terrible. NBC is probably the worst of all. It’s called Concast. C-O-N, not Com. C-O-N, Concast, because they’re cons. It’s a big con job. It’s a big con job. They spend all that money for public relations, and then I talk about them, that’s the end of the public relations. Con job. How did you guys do today, please, on Section 230. Mike Lee, how are you doing? You know what? What they’re doing is a disgrace. Joe Biden is a corrupt politician and they refuse to talk about it. You’ve got to do it. You’ve got to do it. I mean, it’s crazy. They’re getting away, what the big tech is getting away with. They will not allow anybody to even discuss it. With me, they write false stories, they can do whatever they want. Section 230, Rand. I hope you’re all looking at it, okay? I hope you’re all looking at it. Because there was a lot of stuff today. They were up there and they were very nervous in front of the Senate. They were very nervous. I have to tell you that. They were shaken up a little bit, because without Section 230, they don’t even exist. They don’t even exist. For 47 years, Joe Biden betrayed the American people and he betrayed Hispanic Americans. Over the last four years, I’ve been delivering for Hispanic Americans like never before. And Hispanic American unemployment reached an all time low prior to the pandemic. It’s crazy. I love you too. Nobody knows what happened. The fake news, look at all of them back there. That’s a lot of fake news back there. Look at that. Those red lights just went off. Anytime I refer to them, they turn the light off very quickly. They don’t want to have it broadcast when I call CNN bad names. Hispanic American families saw their net worth skyrocket by 64%. And I’m sitting in the hottest sun I’ve ever felt. This is hot. My last stop also in your great state, it had a different problem. The sun was hot. I’ve never seen wind like that. It’s lucky I don’t need teleprompters like Sleepy Joe because the teleprompters were falling down. They were going all over the place. I was getting a headache. I’m trying to look. But I have a good memory. I remember things unlike the sleepy one. He’s in a lid again. Did you know that, fellas? He’s in lid. This guy’s in a lid every single day. Lid, that refers to a garbage can. They put the lid on the can. He’s in his basement. By the way, I’d like to be in a basement. I’d like to be in some place. I’d like to be in a beautiful bedroom, nice for a year and a half, two years, never come out of the White House. But I’m your President, I have to. I have to come out. I have to meet people. I have to meet people. We have to meet people. And I said, “This could be a little bit shaky, to meet a lot of people, but we have no choice.” And you probably haven’t heard, but I caught it. I caught it. Did anybody know that? I caught it. And then you get better and you’re immune. And they say, “You’re immune for a year.” They used to say you’re immune forever, but when I got it, I said, “I’m immune.” They said, “It’s only for four months.” I don’t know what happened. They said, “You’re immune for a lifetime,” right? Remember? Until I had it. Once I had it, now it’s only up to four months. But I got better. Great doctors at the White House. We have great doctors. Great doctors all over the country. I had doctors from all over the country. One thing I learned quickly, when you’re the President and you’re not feeling too good, I didn’t feel great, you have more doctors than you’ve ever seen in your life before. It was like a public place. And they were gathered around my bed. They said, “What’s the problem?” I said, “I don’t know, doc, but I’m not feeling too good. And I’ve got to get back on the trail.” You know what the trail is, right? The campaign trail. “I’ve got to get back on the trail. Get me the hell out of here, doc.” John’s Hopkins was great. We have all the great hospitals represented. And I’ll tell you, Walter Reed is incredible. I’ve seen what they do to the soldiers. They come back so badly wounded and they fix them. Thank you. Thank you. Walter Reed is so great, but they’re all around and they’re saying, “Sir, I think you’re going to have to take it easy for a little while.” Then they gave me something called Regeneron. Did you ever hear of Regeneron? And we’re going to make it available to everybody that needs it free. Free, right? Free. Antibodies. And all I know, and I don’t want to give any credit to this drug, I want to say it was me, because I’m in perfect physical condition, and I’m very young. I’m very young and I’m in perfect physical shape. Perfect. I said that jokingly. I said that a couple of weeks ago. CNN, fake news CNN, went crazy. “He’s not in perfect shape and he’s not young.” They went crazy. They thought it was horrible. A horrible, horrible statement. No, we did a great job, and I would like to say that the antibody, what they gave me, didn’t help, but it probably did, because I woke up the next morning and I felt like Superman. I wanted to rip my shirt off, just like Clark Kent. Anybody ever hear of Clark Kent? Just like the legendary Clark Kent. We’re going to win the election. You know that. We’re going to win. This is much more so than four years ago. I’m looking at some of our great Senators. We’re going to win this election. We’re going to have a great victory. And a lot of people want to go out on Tuesday, they don’t want to go out early. It’s called the Great Red Wave. Wait until you see. They always say, “Sir, could you please ask them to go out on Monday, Sunday?” Because you could go out now, you can vote, right? But I said, “They don’t really want that.” They want to make it a little more convenient for you, but when those boosts open up, you’re going to see something that probably has never seen before. You’ve never seen. In Florida, they’re not doing well. They had to get that lead. That lead’s going to be taken over I think very, very quickly. The biggest problem we have is if they cheat with the ballots. That’s my biggest problem. That’s the only thing I worry about. If they cheat with the ballots, right? If they cheat with the ballots. And they did find some in a garbage can from the military, military ballots. It had the name Trump written, they wanted to go for Trump. They found them in a garbage can, hundreds of thousands every day. You don’t wake up and not read a story about it. Every day there’s cheating with the ballots. And you have governors, Democrat Governors, that are players, wise guys. Wise guys and it’s a disgrace. In Nevada, we like Nevada, but you’ve got a Governor There that’s a player. And even if you want to speak, they make it very hard to find a location. But we found one and 50,000 people showed up a couple of weeks ago. Latino home ownership is now at an all time high, all time high. By the way, if you look at new houses, if you look at automobile production, it’s hard to believe, it literally is superseding what we had prior to the pandemic, and nobody is even imagining that. To bring even greater opportunity and prosperity to Latinos and the Latino community, and I say the Latinos and I say the Hispanics, and I have a lot of friends, I say, “What do you like better?” They said, “You can call us anything.” The Latino community in Arizona and around the country, today, I’m announcing the American Dream Plan. Over the next four years, the American Dream Plan will bring more than two million new jobs to Hispanic communities, create over a half a million new Hispanic owned, small businesses, which will end up being large businesses if I know you, and I know you well, great business people, great natural business people, expand opportunities for federal contracting, it’s going to be much easier for you to get some of those jobs, and increase access to capital by hundreds of billions of dollars. You’re going to be in great shape. You’re going to say, “I liked him very much.” No, if Sleepy Joe gets in, they’re going to ask him about it. He’s not going to have a clue. He’s not going to be able to tell you this. More Hispanic Americans be able to buy a home, to afford quality health insurance, and to raise their families in a beautiful, safe neighborhood. And I will provide school choice to every parent in America, school choice. Joe Biden would obliterate everything Hispanic Americans have worked for, wiping out your small businesses with lock downs and regulations, gutting your police departments, and devastating your families with massive tax hikes. He will attack Catholic organizations. By the way, Hispanics, generally speaking, don’t like that too much. And ban charter schools fund, extreme late term abortion, and surrender your country to the violent socialist mob. And you see that happening. How about Portland, right? You know how quick we can fix that? Mike Lee, we can fix that in about, what, 30 minutes, right? The Governor has to call up. He said, “Maybe a little bit less.” That’s why we’re going to win a record share of the Hispanic vote this election day. We are going to win a number that’s never been won by a Republican, and maybe, maybe we’re going to beat the Democrats, that will be incredible. That means you’re on your way to great business. In 2016, Arizona voted to fire our failed and corrupt political establishment and you elected an outsider as President who is finally putting America first. Taken a long time and if I don’t sound like a typical Washington politician, it’s because I’m not a politician. And if I don’t always play by the rules of the Washington establishment it’s because I was elected to fight for you harder than any President has ever fought for their constituents before. To show you how corrupt the Washington media is, I was just, and did you see this? This was just revealed. It was just revealed that, you know anonymous, you know this anonymous that everybody’s been looking for? That law enforcement could have found early if they wanted to, but everybody was looking for anonymous, turned out to be a low level staffer, a sleazebag who’s never worked in the white house. Anonymous was a nobody, a disgruntled employee who was quickly removed from his job a long time ago for, they tell me in competence, I don’t know what for, but they tell me in competence, you know where he works now? He works at CNN, can you believe it? He works at CNN. He wrote a phony book, if you heard about anonymous, it was like somebody that was right next to me. I thought it might’ve been Hope Hicks. I thought I might’ve been Jared, I thought a might’ve been Mike Lee from the great state of Utah. I was extremely worried about Rand Paul, maybe it was Rand. I say, low level, low life that I don’t know. I have no idea who he is other than I got to see him a little while ago on television and I think they threw them out a long time ago. His phony book was just based on fake articles and left wing outlets. He worked with the, listen to this, the fake news, New York Times. And he’s an employee of Google, he works for Google, isn’t that nice? Google, the people that you guys are looking at right now, the whole thing was just one more giant hoax from the Washington swamp and a corrupt special interest group. I’ll tell you what, this guy, in my opinion, he should be prosecuted. He should be prosecuted. The left wing media and the swamp are doing everything in their power to try and stop us and by the way, we’re here and they’re not, and their heads are exploding, their heads are exploding. The media has been peddling their lies for the last four years and they’ve had a lot to say, but in the meantime, here we are, and we’re going to win the greatest election and you know what? This election is more important than any election in the history of our country, including the last one and I never thought I’d say that. But you get the last word on November 3rd. You can ensure that when the results pour in, the corrupt media, are you guys ready for this? Look at all of them. Look at all of those corrupt people. Look at all of those corrupt people. The corrupt media, I used to call them the fake news, I thought it was one of the great terms I made, but it’s not strong enough. The corrupt media is bowing their heads in shame, not cheering for sleepy Joe. I can’t imagine why they want him, I mean, I can’t figure it. That one I can’t figure, but it’s up to you. This is your country and you have to save and create a great, beautiful pathway for your country. Get out and vote. You’re going to show up in record numbers, vote for America and against the corrupt media and against the swamp. And nobody ever told me the swamp was that deep or that vicious, swamp creatures, they are. And some of the worst creatures in the swamp are the rhinos, we got some rhinos. But they are a dying breed, they are a dying breed. They’re getting a little tired, they’re getting a little tired of calling it wrong, it’s incredible. Under Biden’s cruel and senseless lockdowns countless Americans will die from suicide, drug overdose, deferred medical care, alcoholism, abuse, so many different things. The cure cannot be worse than the problem itself, we would say that, we talked about that Rand, right? Rand knows, that’s what happens, what happens to a society, what happens to a country. You take a look at Michigan where she has everybody locked down, we won a case in the Supreme Court, Michigan, the constitutionality we wanted, they said it was unconstitutional but in the meantime, she goes on with the appeals. The only one that’s free to roam in Michigan is her husband, he’s the only one. He’s allowed to go boating and do whatever he wants. We got to open up Pennsylvania, we got to open up North Carolina, we got to open up California, got to open up New York. If I lived in California, New York, Illinois, I’d vote for Trump. And you know what I used to say? And this comes so well, our relationship because of criminal justice reform and prison reform and all the other things with the African American community, I used to say, what the hell do you have to lose? And they agreed with me and we’re doing incredible. The relationship, what we’ve done is incredible. What we’ve done is incredible. But I say the same thing to the people living in New York, California, Illinois, automatic wins for the Democrats, I say, “Vote for Trump. We’ll cut your taxes. We’ll get you back. We’ll bring it back.” I say, “What the hell do you have to lose? Vote for Trump.” It’s tough when you have those three big States, it’s automatically put into it, it doesn’t matter who runs. No matter who, if we brought back the late great Abraham Lincoln, New York, California, Illinois. So we got to run the gauntlet. We got to run the coast, right? And that’s what happened last time, we won Florida and we won South Carolina and we won Georgia, we won North Carolina. Remember that was going to be their firewall. That didn’t work out too well for them. And we won Pennsylvania and we just ran the coast, didn’t we? That was one of the most exciting evenings Mike Lee, right? Mike Lee, Utah. And we won Utah, right? And we won them all. We won them all. They said there is no way to 270, remember 270, you need 270. There is no way for Donald Trump, this was at 5 o’clock before the polls. There is no way for Donald Trump to get to 270, we’re wasting our time. I said, “I don’t think so.” But they turned out to be right, we couldn’t get to 270, but we did get to 306. There is no way, remember that? We won Ohio, Ohio is great, won by eight points. They thought we were going to tie, they thought it was going to be close and they called immediately, Donald Trump has won the state of Ohio. And then they said, “Not only won, he’s won by eight points.” That was the beginning. They said, “What’s going on here?” We’re going to have a bigger surprise in six days, Tuesday. If you vote for Biden, it means no kids in school, no graduations, no weddings, no Thanksgiving, no Christmas, and no 4th of July together, other than that, you’ll have a wonderful life. Can’t see anybody, but that’s all right, you’ll have a wonderful life. He wants everyone to, and again, it’s not him. I’m using this but it’s not him. Who said puppet? He is a puppet, he’s a puppet but he’s a beauty, I’ll tell you. Look, look, look, I shouldn’t say this because it’s very disrespectful, but I don’t care because he’s not a nice guy. We have some historians here, true American historians here. He is the worst candidate ever to run in the history of a Presidential election, he is. He’s the worst. That’s why there’s tremendous pressure on me. I wish he was a good candidate. At least if you lost, you could say, “Hey, you lost to a good candidate.” How the hell do you lose to a guy like this? I don’t care, I don’t care. We’re going to win. We got to win! You’re going to lose your country if we don’t win. The worst in Presidential politics, now you’re going to lose your country, it’ll be a disaster. He’s not going to be running things, you have Kamala. If you don’t pronounce her name exactly right she gets very angry at you. And you know what she does when she gets angry? She starts laughing like she did on 60 minutes. Uncontrollable laughs. That means she’s angry. Sleepy Joe wants to keep everyone locked down forever, including young people, which will cause enormous harm to Hispanic Americans, African Americans, Asian Americans, women, men, everybody. The Biden plan will crush you and your family, my plan will crush the virus and we’re going to be stronger, stronger than ever. Our country will be stronger than ever before. Biden is the candidate of layoffs, lockdowns, and misery. I am the candidate of jobs, vaccines and prosperity. Our early and aggressive action saved over 2 million American lives. We saw it, we had to make a decision, we closed it up, we understood it. Remember, it was supposed to be 2.2 million people we’re going to die. We started doing ventilators, we didn’t have ventilators, we became the King of ventilators, all over the world we’re now sending ventilators, all over the world. We did a great job. We weren’t acknowledged. We have governors saying what a great job we did. Everybody was saying what a great job. We did a great job, wasn’t acknowledged and that’s okay. But the generals, the admirals, Mike Pence, all of these people that worked on this, they should be acknowledged. We did a job. Remember, Joe Biden with the H1N1, which he always reverses. H1N1, right? He goes, “N1H1,” I said, “No, Joe it’s the other way.” The Swine Flu, right? It’s the Swine Flu. He was a disaster, his chief of staff said they didn’t know what the hell they were doing. And now he’s always telling me I should have acted quicker except when I closed our country to China, because it was so heavily affected and Europe, he was totally against it. He said I’m xenophobic. I said, “Do me a favor? Give me a definition, Joe.” He couldn’t do that because he had no idea what it meant. But here are some of the governors talking about what a great job we’ve all done, we’ve done but what a great job we’ve done in fighting the China virus. It saves a lot of words. In fact, I can go home now. Goodbye everybody. Thank you. We only bring those very expensive boards to a very special group of people, it’s quite costly but it does save a lot of talk, doesn’t it? Joe Biden has surrendered his party to the rage, filled Socialists and Marxists and left wing extremists. The Democrats know that Biden is just a vessel to implement their Socialist take over and that’s what they’re trying to do, we can’t let that happen. That’s why his running mate is the number one most Liberal member of the U.S. Senate, a sponsor of this insane, green new deal, $100 trillion, $100 trillion. If we had the greatest 100 years in history, we couldn’t pay $100 trillion dollars. This was made up by AOC plus three, who, I don’t know if she’s ever even studied the environment, has she ever taken a course on the environment? I doubt it. Biden and his party has spent the entire year inciting violence and hatred against our police, our great police. Last night, the city of Philadelphia was ransacked by violent mobs of Biden supporters for a second night in a row. We could have stopped that, that one we could have stopped in 12 minutes. Stores were looted, nearly a dozen people were shot, and dozens of officers were injured, it would have been so easy, we’re waiting for a call. We’ll send in the federal government, have to get a call, we’ll send in the federal government, we’ll solve that problem so quickly. In Seattle, they took over a big part of the city, we said, “Finally, we have to go in.” We didn’t have the permit, we’re doing it anyway. We let them know what going in. As soon as we let them go, “We’re going in tomorrow morning,” we told them, as soon as we did that, they held up their hands and they said, “We’re going home.” In Minneapolis, we went in a week and a half later and I give the governor some credit, he said, “Let’s go.” But it should have been a week earlier, a week and a half earlier and they formed a line and it ended in 25 minutes, it was all over. Minneapolis. That’s why we’re going to win the great state of Minnesota. We’re going to win Minnesota because of that. For two reasons we’re going to win because of that and Ilhan Omar, we’re going to win because of her too. How the hell did she get elected? She does not like our country, I can tell you. Biden and Harris stand with the rioters and the vandals. I stand with the heroes of law enforcement. And I think I’ve been endorsed by almost every major police group in the United States. And during the debate, I asked him, I said, “Joe, who endorsed you? Any of the law enforcement groups?” He couldn’t name one. He couldn’t name one. Then I said, “Joe, say the words, law enforcement. Say the words, law and order.” He wouldn’t do it. He wouldn’t do it. Number one, he couldn’t remember the two words in conjunction, but more importantly, he didn’t want to lose the radical left because if he says those words, he loses the radical left. This election day, you must stop the anti-American radicals. I mean, these are radicals. From delivering the far left in thundering defeat, you have to deliver them a defeat like they haven’t seen before. Not just a little one. We don’t want to win this close. Joe Biden is a corrupt politician. Last night, we learned that Joe was intimately involved in the Biden family’s corrupt business deals with China while he shipped American jobs to China by the thousands. If Biden wins, China wins. When we win, you win. Arizona wins and America wins. And you know that as big as that story was last night, not one mention on social media, not one mention in big tech, not one mention in any of the major outlets, not one mention on any of the networks. Only Fox had it. Fox had it. Tucker did a good job. Sean did a good job. Laura did a good job. Not one mention. So it’s not freedom of the press. It’s you know what we have? Suppression of the press. This is no longer freedom of the press. This is suppression of the press. And we have some very powerful people right here. We cannot let this go on. It’s suppression. It’s unthinkable what’s going on. And yet they’ll write the littlest thing if somebody else does anything or doesn’t have to do it, they make up fake stories. We’re thrilled to be joined by somebody that’s done a great job and been your great governor, Doug Ducey. Done a great job. Thank you, Doug. Great job. A woman who’s running for the Senate. Currently a Senator respected by everybody. Her opponent wants to terminate your Second Amendment. Martha McSally. Martha. Great. Martha. Martha, go ahead. Martha, come up just fast. Fast. Fast. Come on quick. You got one minute, one minute, Martha’s sake. They don’t want to hear this, Martha. Com on let’s go quick, quick, quick, quick. Come on. Let’s go. Thank you. Thank you, Martha. Thank you. Very important. And you know, you can think of a lot of things, but think about your Second Amendment. His sole function is to terminate your Second Amendment, and all of them, that’s what they want to do and they’re in lockstep. A friend of mine, a great Senator, somebody that has extraordinary common sense. That’s one of the reasons he’s a successful man at what he does. Senator Rand Paul. Come on up, Rand. Look at him. Look at this guy. Come on up. Come on. Two immune people. Thank you. That's right. Thank you, Rand. What a good guy. Great job, Rand. Thank you very much. We have another great Senator from the State of Utah and he’s a smart one, he’s a good one, he’s a respected one. Mike Lee, come on up. Come on, Mike. Thank you, Mike. Good job. Thank you very much, Rand and Mike. What a job. Thank you. That’s why they’re successful senators and respected by everybody. Thank you. We have another great friend. I think he’s going to be replacing Nancy Pelosi soon. I really believe that. House Minority Leader, Kevin McCarthy. Come up, Kevin. Where’s Kevin? He’s going to replace craziness. He’s an incredible guy. My friend. Thank you. Wow. Kevin McCarthy. Thank you, Kevin. Beautiful. Really beautiful. Thank you. So two people that have fought hard, love your state, they’re tough. They’re brilliant and they are warriors, Andy Biggs and Debbie Lesko. Where are you? Look at you. Thanks, Andy. Thanks, Debbie. A friend of mine, a lot of people say one of the most powerful men in Europe, Nigel Farage. Come on up, Nigel. He’s a very non-controversial person too. That’s all he’s got. Come on, Nigel. He’s very shy. Thank you, Nigel. That’s something. Wow. I’m glad I called him up. Thank you very much, Nigel. That’s something. He’s responsible for a lot of things that have happened over in Europe. Very positive things too. Thank you very much. A friend of mine who is a brilliant, brilliant gentleman, he loves fights. He just loves fighting. He’s somebody that’s made a lot of money with fighting. A lot of people say, “Oh, let’s not fight,” but he disagrees. He owns that he’s the head of the UFC. You know what that is? Dana White. The great Dana White. Thank you, Dana. Thank you. This guy is something, I’ll tell you. What a job he’s done. State treasurer, Kimberly Yee. Kimberly. Kimberly. Where’s Kimberly? Thank you, Kimberly. Good job, you’re doing. How are the finances? Okay? You’re doing well? Good. Maricopa County Supervisor, Clint Hickman. Thank you, Clint. Good job, Clint. GOP chair, she’s tough, she’s smart and she’s with us and she’s always been with us. She works hard. Kelli Ward. He's great. He's great. So thank you all very much. That was very interesting. I didn’t think I’d have anyone speak, but it was one after another I’m glad they did it, right? That was great. We don’t usually do that. Usually it gets a little boring when people speak and this group was a hell of a group. Thank you all. Thank you all very much. Together, we built the greatest economy in history and now we’re doing it again. We increased middle-class family income over $5,000, more than five times the gains under the last administration. After the virus arrived, we passed $3 trillion of economic relief and saved over 50 million jobs, many in your state, many, many in your state. We’ve experienced the smallest contraction and the fastest recovery economically by far of any major nation in the world. That’s a big thing. And our numbers are going to be coming out very shortly, very soon. GDP, and the Fed in Atlanta just made a prediction, they said 35%. Now, I’ll take 25 right now. 35 would be many times larger than the largest number we’ve ever had. GDP, the all-important GDP, 35 is what they predict and let’s see what happens. And it’ll be three days before the election. So I’ll make you a deal. If the number’s a bad number, you don’t have to vote for me. Okay? But I think it’s going to be incredible. If you look at housing starts, if you look at automobile and all the productivity that we’ve had, if you looked at hiring, 11.4 million people over a short period of time. Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure border in US history. And we built over 400 miles of new wall, including 200 miles right here in the State of Arizona, 200 miles. It goes down very deep and it goes up very high. There are two reasons it goes down deep. One is to hold it up, and the other is for tunnels. You never had it so good. And your numbers are fantastic. Joe Biden has pledged to open borders. He even said, “Maybe we’ll rip down the wall.” I don’t think that’s going to happen. He wants open borders. If you don’t have borders, you don’t have a country. His plan would completely eliminate our borders, by implementing nationwide catch and release. You catch them, killer, a rapist, whoever it is, and you release them into our country. And then in the debate, he said, “Oh, but they come back for trial.” No, they don’t, Joe. They don’t come back. You don’t see them again. This would trigger a tsunami of illegal immigration from every corner, all over the world. He’s also pledged to, and you know what he wants to do, give free healthcare and mass amnesty for all illegal border crosses, bankrupting your Medicare and your social security systems. I don’t think so. And we all have a heart. We want to take care of people, but everybody all over the world would pour into our country. We wouldn’t be able to do it. Under Biden’s plan, you’ll have no borders, no healthcare, no middle-class. You’ll have no country, frankly. We invested $2.5 trillion in the US military, including nearly $1 billion to build the world’s most advanced guided missiles. Guess where we’re building them? Right here in Arizona. Right? We also passed the VA Choice and VA Accountability, things said that, “You’ll never get them done, sir. You’ll never get it done.” We got them both done. Accountability, where we can fire bad people that work at the VA, that don’t love our vets. We take care of our vets and now they don’t have to wait for two weeks, three weeks, five weeks, seven weeks. Now they go, and if they can’t get good service… We have great doctors in the VA. But if you can’t get the service, you go to a local doctor, a local hospital, we take care of the bill. We have a 91% approval rating now, the highest ever by far with our guys. We took 100% of the ISIS caliphate and we killed the leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi. We took out the world’s top terrorist. Soleimani is dead. I withdrew from the last administration’s disastrous Iran nuclear deal. $150 billion for nothing, for nothing. I recognized the capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem and even got it built. And even got it built. Right? I even got it built. Got it built for, supposed to cost $2 billion, we did it for 500,000, a slight cost underrun. That was called the cost underrun. You don’t see that in government too much. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. They’ve been working on that for 52 years. I got it done in about two hours. Every president promised these things, but they never got them done. There’s a lot of pressure on people when you have that Jerusalem, Golan Heights, a lot of pressure, but we got them done. And instead of never ending wars, we are forging peace in the Middle East. We are forging peace. And I’ve said this, and I’ve said it a lot, but I meet it with every breath, I’ve done more in 47 months then sleepy Joe Biden has done in 47 years and it’s true. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs and the American dream. Abraham Lincoln was a great Republican, and [inaudible 01:01:32] remember that. I can be more presidential than any president other than possibly Abraham Lincoln, when he’s wearing the hat. That’s a tough one. No, he was a great Republican. Over the next four years, in conclusion, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we will end our reliance on China once and for all. That’s already started. We will make our medical supplies right here in the United States, right here in Arizona. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement. And we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. We will defend religious liberty free speech, the right to life and the right to keep and bear arms, Second Amendment. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. That’s what we have. And the 2.5 trillion, all made in the USA, we have the finest missiles and rockets and tanks and submarines and jets, the F-35 stealth. You can’t see it. “Sir, you can’t see it. That makes it good.” I said, “I think that makes it good. What do I know?” But I know if you’re the opponent and you can’t see the jet, you know what? You got a little advantage there. Now we have the best in the world and our nuclear arsenal has been refurbished and restocked and hope to God, we never have to use it. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency. Already completed, goes into effect… Bigger than healthcare, you watch on January 1st. Lower drug prices, even more. First year in 52 years, that drug prices, prescription went down, when I instituted what’s called a favored-nations clause. We pay the most in the world. We’re now going to be tied for the lowest price in the world. We will protect your social security and your Medicare. And we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. And NASA is now again the preeminent space station. There’s nothing like what we have. What a job they’ve all done, including our great Vice President, Mike Pence. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, “In God we trust.” For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now, you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the people of Arizona. From tombstone to Tucson, right? Tucson, does anybody come from Tucson? My friend comes from Tucson. From Mesa to Yuma, from Prescott to right here in Goodyear. Good year. We inherit the legacy of red blooded American patriots, who poured out their heart, sweat and soul to secure our liberty and defend our freedom. This great state was settled by some of the toughest men and strongest women ever to walk the face of this great, wonderful, beautiful planet. Arizona’s where Wyatt Earp and Doc Holiday became American legends. It’s where the great American West became the American dream. And Arizona is the state where generations of pioneers and prospectors, miners and ranchers, cowboys, and cattle hands, marshals and lawman, tamed the frontier, braved the blazing sun, like I’m doing right now, and showed the entire world how the west was won. They helped make America into the greatest nation in the history of the world. And the best is yet to come. Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of Arizona… Go out and vote. Go out and vote. We have made America powerful again. We have made America wealthy again. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again, proud. We have made America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you very much. Thank you, Arizona. Go out and vote. Thank you.

"100","10-29-20","Wow. Thank you very much. That was a little bit of a surprise. That was a surprise. Thank you, Melania. Good job. They love our first lady. They love our first lady. And America is blessed to have you. Thank you very much, honey. That was great. So I’m thrilled to be here in my, our, home state, Florida. I love this state and I love the people of this state. And five days from now, we are going to win Florida and we are going to win four more years in the White House. And we’re going on to win a record share of the Hispanic American vote. You see what’s happening. Ah, they’re very concerned back there. The fake news, they are so concerned. Melania, you don’t know too much about them. You’ve seen enough. But they are very unhappy. You know what’s happening, don’t you? You see what’s happening? We’ve led Florida every single day. What’s going on? This is a terrible thing for them. Actually, it’s a good thing for them. They just don’t know it. They haven’t quite figured that out yet. No, we’re doing incredibly in Florida. We’re doing incredibly all over. And this isn’t based on polls, this is based on facts. This is based on votes that are coming in. But you have to get out and vote. We are creating the greatest red wave in the history of our country. Oh, it’s been amazing. We’ll talk about it a little while. I want to get some of the little introductions and introductory things out, but we have to talk about what’s going on in our country with the big tech, the power of big tech. They’re incredible. They’re incredible. No, no, no. I heard about the power for a long time. The power of big tech. I heard about it four years ago. “Sir, big tech is against you. They’re tremendously powerful. You can’t beat them.” Then we had the election and we won. I said, “Oh, how did that happen?” And the fake news media, 94% of the stories about us are negative. Think of it. Think of it. 64% of the stories about Sleepy Joe are positive. How the hell do you have a positive story about this guy? How do you have a positive story about him? This election is a choice between my plan to deliver historics. And you know what this is going to be, right? Historic. This is historic prosperity. Another major tax cut to go along with the biggest tax cut in the history of our country. And record job growth. And Joe Biden’s plan is to deliver punishing lockdown. She’s going to lock you down. And Florida’s all opened up. You have a great governor. Did he speak too long today or not? No? No, I watched him on the plane. I said, “Oh, look, there’s Ron.” They have the little thing in the box. I said, “Oh look, there’s Ron. He’s speaking.” He looked like he was up there a long time. She said yes. He’s a great governor. You have a great governor. He’s a great guy. They want to give you massive tax hikes. The first time that I’ve ever seen … I’ve been with politics all my life, essentially. Only doing this for a few years on this side of it. But we’ve done well, haven’t we? What do you think? A senator came into my office, said, “Sir.” An older guy, nice guy, pro, total pro. “Sir, I’ve been in nine races and I’ve won seven of them. So now I’m a United States Senator.” I said, “Senator, I’ve been in one race and I’ve won one. Now we want to win two. But I won one. But it was the presidency.” We took them all by surprise, didn’t we? We took them by surprise. They’re still trying to recover. And you will have a crippling depression, the likes of which you’ve never seen, if Sleepy Joe becomes your president. And your 401Ks, throw them out the window because you know what’s going to happen. And you know our stock market has a big headwind. The headwind is if he wins, and we are doing great. You see the number today? 33.1 GDP. The biggest in the history of our country by almost triple, right? Almost triple. Now it’s very much bigger than any GDP we’ve ever had. You have to go back to the 1950s, and then it’s less than half. This is the greatest number, 33.1%. If you asked me two weeks ago, I would’ve said I’ll take 12%. 12% would have been very nice. Nobody ever heard of 12%. 33.1. And let me tell you what they’re going to do. I never even thought of this one. They won’t even talk about it. This is the biggest event in business in 50 years. Nobody’s ever seen a number like this. This is bigger than any nation. No nation has a number like that. Other nations right now, they’re … Look, we were compared to Europe. Germany is doing so well, France is doing so well, everyone’s doing so well. No, they’re not doing well. And you take a look at what’s going on. And we want the best for them, we’re on their team. We want to work with them and everything else, but they’re not doing well. They’re spiking up big, they’re shutting down, they’re locking down. I disagree with that because we’re never going to lockdown again. We locked down, we understood the disease. And now we’re open for business. And that’s what it is. And that’s what it is. This explosive economic growth is four times greater than what the experts expected. They expected a number that would be like 7%, 8%. But here’s what’s going to happen. You’re going to go back home. You’re going to say, “That was incredible. Melania was unbelievable. The governor was incredible. I’ve never heard anybody speak like that. Trump was okay too. But we have no choice. We have to vote for Trump because it’s between Trump and Sleepy Joe. And anybody beats Sleepy Joe.” I can take a couple of these guys, they’re friends of mine. They’re not good people. They’re better than Joe. I will tell you. Now, do you believe what I’m running against? I’m running against the worst candidate in the history of presidential politics. I don’t care. Win, lose, or draw. This is the worst candidate in the history. He shouldn’t be there. Because Pocahontas kept going instead of getting out. Then it would have been against Bernie, which would have been fine too. You know what? You would have had a more energetic base if we had Bernie. That’s one thing. Because I don’t know if they have a base. Here’s what’s happened. He goes for a speech. They’re showing you thousands. And look, as far as all the way back to that building, as far as the eye can see. And Biden is leaving his basement today, he took the lid off. You know what he does? He takes the lid off, runs to the closest part of Delaware, like if he can get a little piece of Pennsylvania. People in Pennsylvania are wise to him. They know all about his no fracking, no fracking, no fracking. Then he gets to Pennsylvania. He learns it’s a million jobs. And by the way, Pennsylvania, they give us that you can fire up your factories. They give us the energy. And it’s inexpensive energy. So he goes to Pennsylvania. All of a sudden, he changes. “Yeah, so I have nothing against fracking.” And the press doesn’t call him out on it. Right? And they don’t call them out on where’s Hunter? They don’t call him out, where’s Hunter? Where’s Hunter? Is Hunter in the crowd? They don’t call him out. They don’t call him out on where’s Hunter? It’s crazy. It’s crazy. Some people said, I get a call from all the experts, right? Guys that ran for president six, seven, eight times. Never got past the first round, but they’re calling me up, “Sir, you shouldn’t be speaking about Hunter. You shouldn’t be saying bad things about Biden because nobody cares.” I disagree. Maybe that’s why I’m here and they’re not. But they say, ” Talk about your economic success. Talk about 33.1%, the greatest in history.” Now, look, if I do, I mean, how many times can I say it? I’ll say it five or six times during the speech. 33.1. But you look at that and you look at Tucker Carlson, what he did the other night. Great. Great. And followed up by Sean and followed up by Laura. And the next day, nothing at all, right? Nothing. Nothing in the New York Times, the fake New York Times. Hey, how about Anonymous? Did we see Anonymous? A low staffer. Anonymous turned out to be a guy. I’m trying to figure out, I don’t know who the hell this guy is. So the New York Times said, “A senior white house official.” Nobody knew who he was. Look, we are in big trouble with the press. They are truly the enemy of the people. They are the enemy of the people. So this guy goes out, this low life. Well, I never saw him. I think he has a picture of me standing there like I do with thousands of people. This low life goes out and he writes a book. By the way, when he left, he had nothing but praise for the Trump. Oh, it’s incredible. Incredible. Then somebody gets him at the New York Times, the fake New York Times. And all of a sudden, he becomes nasty and he writes. And they say, “A top White House official.” Well, he was a staffer, low, had nothing to do with the White House. He had nothing to do. And he goes in, and you know what? There should be major criminal liability for some scum like this. And for a year, everybody walks into my office, Secretary of State Pompeo. I could name every one of them, all good people. I’m looking at them and say, “I wonder if that could be the one.” And it turns out to be this low life that nobody knows who the hell he is. He had nothing to do with us. I don’t think I ever met him. And I might’ve met him. I think somebody said he has a picture of me standing someplace. This is a disgrace to our country. It shouldn’t happen. And he should be prosecuted. Are you listening to me back in Washington? He should be prosecuted along with the New York Times because it was a story made up, it was fake news made up by the New York Times. And you know who he works for now? CNN. He works for CNN Right there. See the camera right there with the light that just went off? See that, honey? That red light just went off. Fake news, CNN. And Anderson Cooper asked him, “Are you Anonymous?” And he lied to him. He said, “No,” essentially. Said, “No, I’m not.” And he works for CNN. I would think CNN would be firing him for that, but this is a real low life. You know who else he works for? Google. He works for Google. I think Google should fire him very quickly because bad things are going to happen to him. But think of what he does to our government. Right? It’s like a horrible, treasonous, horrible thing that you can do this and you can get away with it. Weekly jobless claims, this is boring but it’s really good, just hit a seven month low. In other words, from the beginning of the pandemic seven months ago. We’re going to have next year the best year we’ve ever had economically. And it’s true. Biden is holding back the stock market because it’s an election, crazy things can happen. Maybe 100% of the people in Florida decide not to vote. You never know. But we have a headwind. So it’s gone down a little bit over the last few days because you’re coming close. And it could be. We’re going to win this election so big. You watch. You watch. We’re going to win so big. And that’s the only reason the market’s going down. The market’s going down because if he gets in, seriously, you’re going to have one of the worst depressions we’ve ever had. You’re going to have. And John Roberts from Fox is back there. And I think he agrees. And John Roberts is very unhappy because he doesn’t want his 401K to go down the tubes. No, John’s treated us very fairly. Not perfect. He’s not perfect, I will say, but he’s been overall pretty good. He’s pretty good. So, CNN, Google, we got to do something about all of it. New York Times is fake. It’s fake. They write so many fake stories. Thanks to our policies, America is experiencing the fastest and biggest recovery. We’re having the best recovery anywhere in the world. No other country, small or large is recovering like us. Think of that. In the past five months, we’ve created a record 11.4 million American jobs, the fastest job growth in the history of our country. Our job growth has been 23 times faster than the first five months under Obama/Biden recovery, which was, by the way, the worst recovery since the Great Depression. You do know that, right? And just so you know, because all Biden does is talks about COVID. Right? He doesn’t call it the China virus. You know why? Because China has him paid off. He can’t use that term. They gave his son one and a half billion to manage. He makes millions of dollars a year, I assume. Right? The smartest guys in Wall Street said, “No, sir, that could not have happened. We can’t get it.” No, took him about, what, 10 minutes? He walked in, he walked out with one and a half billion. Hey, maybe he’s not so stupid after all. Right? That’s the only thing. I thought he was so dumb. Maybe he’s not as dumb as we think. Look, he cannot take on China. I didn’t say anything. I didn’t say… The biggest story, no, the second biggest story, the worst was when they spied on my campaign and they got caught. That’s the biggest political corruption story in the history of our country, but this could very well be second. And we have what’s called the laptop from hell, the laptop from hell. From what I’ve understood, you only have seen a tiny portion of it, but you know what the press is now doing? They’re blaming Russia. It’s Russia did it. Russia is the one that created the laptop. And Russia brought it into that little shop to have it fixed. Russia. I think Russia’s looking at us, they’re saying, “Those people are stone cold crazy. This is…” No, it was Russia’s fault. They said it. Loud and clear. It was Russia, Russia, Russia. Aren’t we tired of this crap? I saw a Schiff the other day, two days ago, watermelon, he looks like a watermelon head. Right? Remember he lied in the halls of Congress. He read my conversation with the president of Ukraine, but it wasn’t my conversation. Hey, how great do we love those people that took down the language, professional military people, word for word for word. If I didn’t have it, it would have been my word against shifty Schiff. Right? Eight times he said quid pro quo. Think of what that means. Eight times you’ve asked for the same thing. After the third time, the guy on the other side would say, “He’s got some serious problems.” I don’t even know him. I called him to say congratulations on becoming president of Ukraine, and for that, I got impeached. But you know what we have, we have a lot of great Republicans, and I hope you’re going to be voting for those Republicans, also. Great Republicans. We have one of them here, Mark Meadows. Has anyone ever heard of Mark Meadows? Took me three years to get them out of Congress and become chief of staff. He’s great. He’s here. He was one of our great ones. And you know who helped me a lot? Honestly, in fact, I said, “Don’t run for governor, Ron. Stay exactly where…” He was a Congressman, your governor. Right? There he is. Look at Mark. He’s out there working with the phone. He’s got the phone going. He uses two at one time. Right? But your governor was another one. He stood up… He’s Harvard and Yale. Do you know that? Your governor. He doesn’t talk about it. He doesn’t talk about it. But he would be on television defending me and fighting for me. There was a group…Jim Jordan. Did anyone ever hear of Jim Jordan? Jim Jordan, 128 and one. Jim was an NCA wrestling champion. One of the best, one of the best. He was a great one. He was a great one. And when you win like he won, he won everything. When you win like that, it’s also right here. It’s muscle, but it’s got to be muscle attached to a lot of brain. Right? You guys know, the athletes know it. But Jim was great, but Ron was fantastic, your governor. He asked me, he said, “Would you support me for governor?” I said, “No, not really. I’d rather have you stay right where you are. You’re doing a good job of defending me.” But think of it, what we had to do, and we got 197 to nothing in the House. Think of that. 197 to nothing. And then we went to the Senate, and we had 52 and a half to a half. You know who the half? But that’s okay. That was the guy that Sleepy Joe Biden he couldn’t remember his name. Remember he said the guy from… The guy from, isn’t he the governor from that place? Utah. Utah. I don’t know his name. I can’t remember his name. It was Romney. No, Sleepy Joe’s a little bit off. Let’s face it, Sleepy Joe is shot. And I’m not a fan of his, and he’s not a nice guy. If he was a nice guy I couldn’t say these things. He’s not a nice guy. Now he doesn’t remember whether or not he used to be a nice guy. He was never considered smart. He was a touchy feely guy. You know those guys? Touchy feely. But not a nice guy. Not a smart guy. Our incredible First Lady is sitting here right now, and she’s saying to herself, “I wonder if all rallies are like this.” No, most of them are a little bit different, but that’s okay. You know why, honey? We’re in Florida. This is like home. This is home. Right? This is home. We say it like it is. We say it like it is. We created the greatest economy in history, and now we are doing it again. See, oh, that hat, that beautiful hat? Let’s make America great again. Right? We’re going to make a new one. Let’s make America great again, again. We did it. We did it. Now we’re doing it again. My First Lady wants to do it again. Under my leadership, the Florida tourism industry and hospitality industry will come roaring back very soon. It’s ready to happen. We’re making the turn. We’ve got the vaccines coming very soon. The FDA has worked miracles. They had no choice, they had… This would have taken, if Joe was in charge, you wouldn’t have a vaccine for four years. I was going to say he was in charge of the swine flu. He calls it N1H1. It’s actually H1N1. I say, “Joe, it’s not. It’s H1. H comes…” It’s easy because H comes before N. I said, “Joe, Joe, that’s what it is.” I said, “Just go with swine flu. You don’t have to call it… The numbers are too complicated.” Three days ago he said, “I’m a proud Democrat running for the United States Senate, and I hope I have your support.” Look, we can’t games. You’ve seen enough. Haven’t you seen enough? This is crazy. But based on the early numbers I’ve seen, I think you understand exactly what I’m talking about. We have the potential. We have the greatest country in the world, but we have the potential to go to places that we’ve never been in a positive manner. The potential of our country is so incredible, and you see it happening already. You look at Germany, you look at all of these countries, they’re now locked down, they’ve got a lot of problems. You look at our numbers, look at our recovery, fastest recovery. We went down ,the least economically went down by [inaudible 00:08:57]. As much as it’s painful and terrible, we went down the least. We’ve done an incredible job. It was projected that we would lose 2.2 million people. Right? The projections were 2.2 million. By the way, we shouldn’t have lost one person. China should have never let this happen, they should have never let it escape, and we will not forget. We will not forget. Biden’s agenda will devastate the Hispanic-American community. He betrayed Hispanic-Americans for 47 years. He’s been very bad to the Hispanic-Americans, and what is happening with those poll numbers? I have the highest numbers. We are now, according to the polls I’m shown, which our real polls, we are now beating the Democrats for the first time ever with Hispanic-Americans. First time ever. First time ever. And I’ve always loved them, and I think they’ve always loved me. First time ever. First time ever. And the fakers back there are going crazy. And now Biden wants to close your small businesses and confiscate your guns. Second Amendment. Don’t worry about it, your Second Amendment. We’re letting far left rioters, looters, and vandals roam free. Look what he’s doing in Philadelphia. Look what’s happening. Those are people that he supported. He couldn’t even come out against them yesterday. They asked him a question, he said, “What’s Philadelphia? Where is it? Where is it?” He didn’t know what state it was in. Other than that, he’s doing a wonderful job. Could you imagine losing to this guy? Could you imagine? Our First Lady will have to say, “Darling, I don’t know. This is impossible.” But you have to be very careful when you say that. Whenever I say anything that even uses the word losing, the fake news said, “He is thinking about losing. This is a big story. President Trump thinks she’s going to lose.” No, I don’t. I don’t. I think you’re going to lose, and I think you’ve lost all credibility. And our elegant First Lady sits and she says, “What the hell is happening again?” This election is a choice between the American dream and a socialist nightmare. That’s what it is. It’s socialism. I used to say Venezuela on steroids. This would be, if they got in, a very, very, very large version of Venezuela, and it can happen with the Green New Deal and all these crazy… Look, AOC plus three, I heard she’s very insulted that I call her AOC. I’m not. I call her AOC plus three. That’s the three characters that… Ilhan Omar. I’m going to win Minnesota because of Ilhan Omar. She tells us how to run our country. She’s telling us how to run our country. I don’t think so. Ilhan Omar. So, we’re going to win the state of Minnesota for two reasons, her and the fact that when Minneapolis had their problem, they should’ve called us sooner. But when they called us, how long did it take? 25 minutes? It was extinguished. We could have done it the first hour instead of waiting for a week and a half. But the governors, they have to call, and I give the governor credit. He eventually called, He eventually called. They should call us, I’ll tell you, Oregon. They should call us in Portland. Oh, would I love to go in with the anarchists. They would last 15 minutes. Our guys, you got to hold them back. They want to… ” Let us in, sir. We’d like to go in.” I meet them. I see troops. “Sir, we’d like to go into Oregon. We’ll take care of it.” I say, “Just calm down. Just calm down.” It wouldn’t take them long. It would take them about 15… How long? And then we’d, well, we’d do things, and then, eventually, they’ end up going home about 10 years later, back home to mom and dad where they started in the basement. Antifa. You know Antifa? So, Biden called it an idea. He said, “Antifa’s just an idea.” I said, “No, when you get hit over the head behind your back with a baseball bat, that’s not an idea. That’s not an idea.” Didn’t he call the United States, he called the United States an idea, too. I said, “No, no, it’s not an idea. The United States is a great nation. That’s what it is. It’s not an idea.” He called us an idea, so he puts us in the same category as Antifa. As long as I am president, America will never be a socialist country, and I say it all the Time. This election will decide whether our children will be condemned to the misery of socialism or whether they will inherit the glorious legacy of American freedom. This election will decide whether the Biden Harris…How about her? How about her? I’ll tell you what, when our great vice president Mike Pence debated her, it was a total… You know the expression, if it were a fight, they would have ended it. Within two days they were saying, the fake news, “She did magnificently well against Mike Pence.” No, no. No. That’s what happens. You do great, great, great. Two days later, you realize they have it down that you lost now. Mike did fantastically. He’s a great vice president. He works very hard. I’ll tell you one thing. His kids are in the military, and they’re teachers. I guarantee you one thing, Mike Pence has not made hundreds of millions of dollars by scamming foreign countries, because that’s what they’ve done. They’ve made hundreds of millions of dollars, and nobody wants to talk about it. Look at that. Oh, are they doing that on purpose? Are they friend or foe? I don’t know. Actually, it felt good. I felt water on my face. I said, “Where the hell is that coming from?” They may be doing that on purpose. Let’s find out if they’re friend or foe, and if their foe, let’s take care of those sons of bitches. Look at that. Are you okay? Oh, look, they’re hitting the press. That’s okay. Oh, there go the cameras. There goes a million dollars worth of equipment. Look at that. Wow. That’s cool, actually. And I’ll tell the media, “I have nothing to do with that,” but it is cooling. I’m feeling a little… It’s amazing. It’s amazing. And I say it all the time, because we’ve liked Ronald Reagan, we’ve liked a lot of… Mostly they’re stiffs. Mostly. Generally speaking, they don’t do the job. Right? But we’ve had good ones like Ronald Reagan. He’s the one I think about. But nobody ever chanted… First of all, he’d never get a crowd like this. He’d have two or 300 people, they’d be in a ballroom. That was like the norm. You got to see yesterday. We had 35, 40,000 people. We were in Arizona the day before, two days before. We were in Pennsylvania. We did three in Pennsylvania, one bigger than the next, like this. And you know what’s common? The love. It’s all the same. The love is incredible. Love for our country. It’s the love for our country. But there’s never been a chance we love you… I’m watching this guy here. He looks like he could take on anybody in the world. He’s a big, strong guy. I don’t think he’s ever cried in his life before, and I see him wiping away tears. We love you. We love you. This guy, he hasn’t cried since he was a baby and probably didn’t cry then either, and now he’s crying. No, there has never been that chance before, and I appreciate it. And I’m crying. That’s why I ended early. I’m crying, except I don’t want them to say, “You’re president broke down in tears today.” I don’t know. That’s not cool. We don’t want President Xi of China to say, “Gee, I just saw something that surprises me.” We’ve taken billions and billions of dollars out of China. We gave 28 billion to our farmers, 28, right out of China. I don’t want to have… But then the plague came in, right? Then the plague came in. That [inaudible 00:43:08] everything… We made a great deal with China. The ink wasn’t dry before the plague came in, so it’s a whole different feeling. I will say, three weeks ago, they ordered more corn, more soy beans, more beef than at any time in the history of this country, so they obviously think I’m going to win. They obviously think we’re going to win, and they want to make us happy, but we’re not happy because that should have been stopped. And it’s not. Here, all over the world, you see what’s going on. Europe. It’s so sad, but you see what’s going on. 188 countries all over the world. What China has done to this world, what they’ve done… People come up to me, they’re clothed and masks and stuff and this… Hello, president. Hello. I said, “Look at this, what China has done to our country. What China…” I may do that. You better be careful. What China has done to this country, which it’s not the first time either. Oh, they’re paying. They’re paying. But you can never pay for 200,000 more lives. You can never pay for that. Yeah, we can make them pay plenty, but a 210,000 lives. But it would have been two million lives. It’s incredible the job that we’ve done and that the American people have done. This could have been two million lives. They said 2.2 million lives. No, they’re going to pay. We believe in safe streets, secure communities, and we believe in law and order, not like in Philadelphia. And they can’t let that happen. They can’t let the looters run wild. They can’t do it. You can’t. You either have law and order or you don’t. Philadelphia can’t do what they’re doing, and they have good police in Philadelphia. They like Trump. I can tell you. I’ve been endorsed by every law enforcement group. New York’s finest, they endorsed me. They’ve never endorsed a presidential candidate. New York’s finest endorsed me. It was a great honor because I grew up with New York’s finest. And they are, they’re incredible people. They’re not being allowed to do their job. They’ve been way… He cut back a billion dollars, he took back, and now crime is way up. And it’s not even the money, they’re not being allowed… They’re incredible people. Tough as hell, fair, they love our country. They’re not being allowed in New York to do our job. Between the governor and the mayor, they’re being just absolutely…And they want to leave. They want to get out. They have plenty of other opportunity. They don’t need the danger. It’s a dangerous job for all police. But we’ve been endorsed by New York. We were endorsed by Chicago police. The Chicago police, that’s… Right? We’ve been endorsed by all of your sheriffs. You have sheriffs. You have great tough sheriffs. I know many of them, but the sheriffs, we had a big ceremony two months ago in Florida. Ron was there. You were endorsed. We got a doors by the sheriffs. All law enforcement all over Florida. And I asked Sleepy Joe at the debate, I said, “Joe, name one law enforcement agency, just one, in the whole country that endorsed you.” He couldn’t do it. Remember? Then Chris Wallace saved him. I had two people. I was going against Chris Wallace and him. Chris was much tougher. Actually, Chris was tougher than Joe. And then I said, “Joe, say the words law and order.” No. “Say the words law and honor, Joe. Say them.” And then Chris Wallace, “He doesn’t have to do that.” Oh, okay, Chris. Thanks. No, I like Chris’s father a lot better than I like him. Mike Wallace, the great Mike Wallace. He did me on 60 Minutes. It was a great… It was one of the few good pieces. He was a tough guy. Chris tries to be like him, but he doesn’t have what it takes. But Mike Wallace was a tough, tough guy. And he did me on 60 Minutes, and it was a great piece. He’s never recovered from that originally, but he passed away. He was a great guy and a great, great reporter, I’ll tell you. And he was a friend of mine. He was a friend of mine. That didn’t mean much to Chris. All we want is fairness. Right? And I will tell you, Kristen Welker, I thought she was very good. I really do. She shouldn’t have been because she was far left. Her family is a supporter of Democrats. Her father’s a big supporter of Democrat. She’s a supporter of Democrats. Should have been very unfair. I think she went out of her way. And most people say she wasn’t really fair to me, but she was because she always gave me a 10 seconds. She said, “Okay.” See, Chris should have done that, “You have 10 seconds.” 10 seconds to me is like an eternity. We did a lot of damage in that 10 seconds, including to get him to admit that he doesn’t want oil. He doesn’t want oil. I said, “Texas and Pennsylvania and Ohio, are you listening? Are you listening?” And you’ll see they were listening on November 3rd. I’m sorry you’ll have to wait till November 3rd. Texas, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Oklahoma, North Dakota, they’re all listening. And you’re listening because you don’t want your energy prices to go through the roof. Right? And Michigan was listening because they want to produce cars and they don’t want to spend all that money on energy where they’re producing all of those factories that I got to go back to Michigan and go back to Ohio and go back to North Carolina and start brand new. And I’d see Prime Minister Abe of Japan. I’d say, “Prime minister, we’re tired of taking your millions of cars. You got to let us have factories.” Well, we can’t do that. This is a private decision. No, no, it’s not. You got to do it. But that is not government. I said, “You’re a powerful man, Shinzo.” He just retired. Unfortunately, he got ill, but he was a great man. He was great prime minister. Great guy, too.” But I said, “Shinzo, you have to do it. I’m sorry. We’re not going to take your cars. You got to make them in this country, in our country.” And he said, “I can’t do that, but let me work on it.” The following morning, five major Japanese companies announced they were coming to America, and they did. I called him up, I said, “Shinzo, I know you had nothing to do with it, but thank you anyway.” No, they run it tough over in Japan and China and these other places. Tuesday, your vote is going to save our country. Most important election we’ve ever had. We are going to defeat the Marxists and the socialist and the rioters and the flag burdens and the left wing extremists. We are going to defeat the anarchists, their anarchy. With your support, we will fight for American workers, we will defend our Second Amendment. Don’t worry, it’s very safe. If Biden got in, your Second Amendment is gone. If Biden got in, your Second Amendment is gone so fast. You know that. Support our police. Protect our borders. Expand school choice. So important. Ensure more products are proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase, “Made in the USA.” That’s what’s going to happen. My plan for America will deliver a safe vaccine. You’re going to have it in a few weeks. It’s coming very quickly. Great companies. Johnson & Johnson. Moderna, Pfizer, many, many companies. You’re going to have it. Seniors will be first in line to get it, and we will make it available to everybody free. It’s not your fault. It’s not your fault. We’re protecting our seniors. If you’re a senior and if you have a heart condition, if you have any kind of a certain type, especially diabetes, you’re in big trouble if you get hit by the China virus. Big, big trouble. So we’re going to make that vaccine. We’re going to make it free, and it’s coming from great, great firms. Our vaccine will eradicate the virus, and by the way, we have it. But whether we have it or not, it’s rounding the turn. It’s rounding the turn. Hey. Excuse me. I’m sure you didn’t hear. Nobody heard this, right? I had it. Did you know that? I had to get back on the trail? I said, “This is not good timing.” And I got better very quickly. First Lady had it. She had it, and she got better very quickly. But I’ll tell you who had it also. The doctor went to the First Lady and myself and said, “Barron has tested positive.” I said, “Excuse me, doctor, tested positive for what?” “He’s got COVID.” I said, “Okay.” Then about 12 minutes later, I said, “Doctor, Doctor, how’s Barron doing?” He’s our very tall son. Very tall. Has anybody noticed he’s slightly tall? He’s 14 and I’m saying, “Hello, Barron.” Now he’s great, but he’s strong. But I said like 12 minutes later, Dr. Sean … Great doctor. We have great doctors. One thing, when you are president, you got a lot of doctors. Johns Hopkins, I want to thank them. Walter Reed Medical Center, incredible. I mean, Dr. Ronny is now a Congressman from Texas. How about that? Dr. Ronny, he was before Sean, and Sean is now, and Sean has been great. But Sean came up along with other doctors, that Barron had it. About 12 seconds later, I said, “How’s Barron doing?” “Oh, he’s okay. He shed it. It’s gone.” It was gone like in two minutes. I said, “Hey, how come that doesn’t happen with me?” But I wasn’t bad. It was like a day, but they gave me a drug, Moderna. Who the hell knows? This was a very … Moderna makes it. I’ll tell you makes really a great version, they say. Eli Lilly, right? Regeneron. And they gave it to me, and I woke up the next morning and I felt I could have taken the toughest, meanest person in this group. Regeneron. Now, I don’t know whether or not it worked. I like to think it had no impact. I made a statement. I said, “Well, I’m in no trouble, because I’m young and I’m in perfect physical shape. I’m a perfect physical specimen.” And CNN went crazy. “He’s not young and he’s not in perfect …” They can’t take a joke. No, but I was better. I was better quickly. I was better very quickly. We reduced the fatality rate 85%, and now we have the lowest infection fatality rate anywhere in the world by far thanks to our unrelenting efforts. And by the way, remdesivir was also approved. It’s supposed to have a great effect. I mean, I said, “Give me whatever the hell you have. Just give it to me.” I wasn’t choosy. You know, the First Lady, “I don’t want anything. I don’t want …” She’s very particular, right? If I say, “Take an aspirin. You’ll feel better.” “No, no. I don’t want an aspirin.” Right? She doesn’t want that. Only 3% of hospitalizations are right now China virus. So think of that. So our hospitals are ready if something should happen, but that’s what … I appreciate that. He said, “We trust you.” You can. We are doing the greatest job of this, except with one thing, publicity. Our public relations, we’re spending too much time working and not enough time talking, but no matter what you say to these people, it won’t make any difference. And because of the advances in treatment we pioneered, the survival rate is far over 99% for many groups. It’s 99.9% And for under 70, it’s unbelievably high. For over 70, now it’s getting very good. And the drug they gave me, what we’re doing is we’re going to make that available, including the very similar drug, it’s antibody, a very similar drug from Eli Lilly. We’re going to make that available to anybody that needs it should they get the China virus. We’re going to make it available free. So if anybody is going to need it, if anybody’s going to need it. Joe Biden’s plan will delay the vaccine, postpone therapies, prolong the pandemic, crush our economy. Crush our economy. We can’t do this. Destroy the Florida tourism industry, and lock down our entire country. We’ll be locked down. Under Biden’s lockdown, countless Americans will die from suicide, drug overdoses, deferred medical care, abuse. The thing that’s happening to families is … The cure, remember, I said it right in the video, the cure can not be worse than the problem itself. And you have Michigan locked down. You have all Democrat governors. You know what’s going to happen? On November 4, the day after the election, they’re going to open it up. They’re doing it for political reasons, because it’s so bad for their state, and they think our numbers are going to look a little worse. California’s pretty much locked down. New York’s got to open. New York is becoming a very unsafe ghost town. Governor, open up the state, governor. Open up the state. You’ll see our governor, he’s going to make a few words in a couple of minutes. Governor from New York is going to be with us in a little while. Are you surprised to see that? You’ll see what I mean. There will be no school, no graduations, no weddings, no Thanksgivings, no Christmases, no 4th of Julys. There will be nothing. They will allow you nothing. Other than that, he’s doing a wonderful job. Europe imposed crushing lockdowns, and today Spain is more than two times more new cases per capita than the United States. France has over three times, and Belgium has over seven times what we have. And I don’t want that. I don’t want that. I don’t want that to happen to them. We’re helping them. We’re sending them thousands and thousands of ventilators. We’ve become the ventilator king. We’re making thousands of ventilators a month. We’re sending them to Europe and all over the world, sending a lot to Africa. They’ll never be able to get them. They’ll never be able to make them. We’ve done an incredible job. Incredible job. European lockdowns are not stopping the virus, but they’re creating misery, poverty, suffering, and death. You see the riots in the street of Italy today, in the streets of Italy? And the riots they’re having in France. The people are tired. They can’t do it anymore. They can’t do it anymore. They’re losing their businesses. They’re losing their jobs. They go back and the business is closed for nine months. We can’t do it anymore. They can’t do it. We know the disease. We social distance. We do all of the things that you have to do. If you get close, wear a mask. Always controversial. It’s not controversial to me. You get close, you wear a mask. Social distance. Social distance. You know the bottom line, though? You’re going to get better. You’re going to get better. If I can get better, anybody can get better. And I got better fast. They were so happy. They couldn’t believe it. That was probably the happiest day that they’ve had in years. And then I came out of the hospital to wave to the people, the supporters. I heard … These really beautiful rooms. Walter Reed is incredible. The best. The best. And rooms, the glass, heavy glass panels over the windows. And through all of that heavy glass, brick and mortar, I could hear people screaming outside a half a mile away. And they were fans of mine with flags, Trump flags. “We love our president.” And they were there for two days. They stayed there all night. I mean, these people were incredible. And I said to my incredible Secret Service people, there’s one of them, Bobby. I know I’m not supposed to say it. Bobby, I love you, Bobby. I said, “Bobby, I want to go over and see them.” “No problem, sir.” He ripped on that mask. He wouldn’t even think about that. I said, “Let’s go over and see them, Bobby.” By that time I was in good shape. I wanted to get out here with you. But we drove in front of those people, and we waved, and the people were so happy. It was incredible. It was. It was a love fest. They were so happy. And I got back and they were saying, “What a terrible thing to do.” No. We got to take care of our people, right? We got to stay with our people, including Secret Service, who does an incredible job. Thank you. Thank you, Bobby. The man. The man. Thank you, Bobby. Thank you, Secret Service. They do a great job. For half a century, Joe Biden has been outsourcing your jobs, opening your borders, and sacrificing American blood and treasure in endless foreign wars. In 2016, Florida voted to fire the depraved political establishment, and you elected an outsider as your president, who is finally, if you don’t mind, putting America first. That’s what we’re doing. Joe Biden is a corrupt politician that the fake news will not write about. They won’t write the story. They won’t write it, and big tech won’t write it. They won’t write the story. There’s the outside of the New York Post, who just endorsed me by the way, thank you very much, so fourth largest paper in the country. Got a lot of great endorsements. We got a lot of great … Jack Nicklaus. You know Jack? But he can do [inaudible 01:01:11] Jack. 78 tournaments he won, and he won 18 majors. Think of that, how great that is. That means under pressure … You need people like that, right? People that can win under pressure. Jack. But Jack gave me a beautiful endorsement. We got endorsements from a lot of newspapers all over. We got a lot of endorsements. If Biden wins, thank you very much. If Biden wins, China wins. When we win, Florida wins and America wins. It’s very simple. And if I don’t sound like a typical Washington politician, it’s because I’m not a politician. And I don’t always play by the rules of Washington and the Washington establishment. It’s because I was elected to fight for you, and I have fought for you harder than any president has ever fought for the people they love. Never. Thank you very much. There’s a lot of people … Look where that crowd is. Would you like to change places with some people in the back? I don’t think so. Thank you. Thank you. That’s incredible. What a crowd. But they’re all like this. I tell you, no matter where you go, 35,000, 45,000. They never mention it. They never mention. But with Biden, they never mention it either. I said, “Show the crowd.” You know what? They have circles. Someday, I’m going to hire the guy that does those circles. No, because it’s really good. Big, thick, nice circles. They’re perfectly done. It’s the best part of his campaign, the circles. And usually he’s got five of them. Usually he can’t fill them up with people, so he puts the fake news in the circles. And then they don’t ask him questions. Or how about the question they asked him the other day? He’s walking out with ice cream. “Sir, what flavor ice cream is it?” “I don’t know. It’s vanilla, I think.” Then they asked him a real question, he ran into the car, went back to the basement. Does he have the lid on again today? Almost every day. How do you put the lid? You know, when you do the lid, he did it like five, six days recently, that’s like 50% of the campaign. Now they try and say it’s because of COVID. They say the fact that he has nobody at all show up is because of COVID. No, it’s because nobody shows up. And I think that’s the ultimate poll, and based on the numbers that we’re getting, we’re going to do really well on Tuesday. We’ll see. Who knows? It’s an election. And if we do win, you’re going to see a stock market that goes through the roof. Your 401ks are going to go up by 50% quickly. You watch. I’m telling you. We know. I know all those guys. They’re just petrified at the thought of having massive tax increases, regulation increases. They said, “We’ve been through that. It wasn’t good.” That’s why they had no growth. That’s why they had no recovery. Slowest ever. Remember I said that. Slowest since 1929. That’s a long time. Not only is Joe Biden corrupt, he’s unfit. He has no plan to end the epidemic. It’s all talk, no action, like I said at the debate. 91% to 9%. You know what that means? They did polls afterwards. 91%. A respected poll, 91% said … I have to do it. I have to brag. You know why? They’ll never do it. Do you know the expression? If you can’t get anybody else to do it, do it yourself. No. 91% to 9%. I’m trying to figure out who was the nine. I want to find who these people were. No, it was just a ridiculous. Ridiculous. I think they could have done better, but you know, you never know. Again, this is why. You never know. His policies would create a depression, and he wants you to surrender our country. That’s what he wants to do. He wants you to surrender our country to China, to all of these other countries that have taken total advantage of us. It’s really the reason I’m here. If it weren’t for the horrible trade deals with South Korea, with our allies, you know, our allies in many ways treat us worse than the enemy. The enemy, at least we have our guard up. Our allies, what they’ve done to us in terms of military protection and trade is disgraceful. And when they come out and they say they like Barack Hussein Obama much more than they like Trump, that means I’m doing my job. You see, Germany said it the other day, and I have roots in Germany. But Germany said it the other day, they like Barack Hussein Obama. And they should, because Germany is delinquent in their NATO payments. Very delinquent. They’re at a half a level, and they’re very rich. They can do whatever they want. It’s not like they don’t have the money. And I call them out. I say, “If you don’t pay, we’re going to start taking our troops out.” And these people go crazy. They go crazy. You watch. Oh, we’ve already started to do it. They’ll pay. But I just want to play you a video from a … I was so impressed. It’s a little bit … We only do this for people that we love. We have these very expensive boards that come along, and this is largely a woman that comes from this area. Her husband happens to be a Major League Baseball player. Do you know who I’m talking about? He’s a handsome guy, but she’s far more beautiful, and he’s on Tampa Bay, so he’s right now a little depressed. I don’t know if he’s here or not, but if he is, I want to talk to him and say you did a great job. Kayleigh, please come up here, Kayleigh, and play the video, please. Play the video. I mean, who’s going to say it better than Kayleigh? So I want to congratulate you. This is our great looking couple. We almost had the Dodgers. Are they that good a team? They’re pretty good, right? Well, you’re pretty good too, and you’re a great couple, and that’s a beautiful baby. Thank you very much. See? She’s smart. She’s smart. She picked a major league ball player. You know what it is to get the major leagues and stuff. You got to be in shape. You can’t look like these guys out here. No, she’s great. But did anybody say, especially on the pandemic, has anybody said it better than that? That was this morning on Fox, Fox and Friends. And I got to tell you, that group, that threesome, they’re great, right? They’re great, right? That’s a great group in the morning. But she said it on Fox and Friends. Ainsley, Steve, and Brian has been really great, right? Brian’s been great. No, they treat us good. We’re thrilled to be joined by your governor, who I know is up here speaking, but I’m going to introduce him a second time because we love him and he’s done a great job, and he loves the people of Florida. Ron DeSantis. Ron. And your Lieutenant Governor, who is a fantastic woman, and she loves her state, Jeanette Nuñez. And we have some warriors you know that used to work with Ron, and without them, maybe I wouldn’t be standing here. Remember, 197 to nothing. Congressman Michael Waltz. Michael. He knows more about … Where is Michael? Michael. You get married yet, Michael? Please get married quickly. You’ll be so depressed, Michael. If you don’t, you’re going to be very, very depressed. Thank you. Thank you. You better do it quick. She’s out of here, Michael. He’s out of here Michael. Another great friend of mine and a warrior, Gus Bilirakis. Thank you Gus. Great job. Great job. Great job. Thank you. Thank you. And Greg Stube. Greg, thank you very much. Greg, great job you’re doing, Greg. These people are tough. I’ll tell you what. We have some incredible people in Washington. Attorney General Ashley Moody, who’s doing a phenomenal job. Thank you, Ashley, for everything. Doing a fantastic job. Florida House Speaker Chris Sprowls. Chris. And so young. Florida GOP Chair Joe Gruters. Joe, where are your Joe? Where’s Joe? Joe, how are we doing Joe? You’ll be out of here so fast if we don’t win this election. He’ll be gone. We are doing well. Yep. We’re going to win. If we don’t win, our country will have trouble. And vote for the Congressman and vote for the Republicans. They want to do what’s right. They want to do what’s right and you know it’s the right thing to do. We have Congressional candidate Scott Franklin and Ana Paulina Luna. Great, I put something up. They have my full endorsement. Great going. I hear you’re both doing very well. Win please. Doing very well. Great, great. Under my administration, we’re reversing the damage that Joe Biden and his group have done over a 47 year period. We’re bringing the pharmaceutical industry back here and back to regions of Puerto Rico. They took it out of Puerto Rico, devastating Puerto Rico. Joe Biden voted to eliminate those jobs and to send them to China and we’re reversing that and we’ve been reversing it now for over two years and it’s moving very rapidly. Last month, I also announced $13 billion in disaster relief for Puerto Rico. They got hit hard. They’re in a little path that causes problems. You know that right? Lot of hurricane problems. Speaking of hurricanes, you have a lot of hurricane problems too, and I’m always there. Ron, am I always there? Ron calls up, “Sir, I’d like to speak to you.” What is it about? Another hurricane? Yes. How many billion do you need, Ron? But I’m always there. And Rick, I’ll tell you what, Rick Scott’s been great. He’s been great. And Marco Rubio has been great. He’s been great, Marco. Very strong guys, strong leaders. Good guys, too. Really good guys. Marco and Rick, you have great people here, great leadership. Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure border in United States history. And we have now built over 400 miles of wall. And we’ll have it finished very shortly. It’ll be finished very soon. You don’t hear about it anymore. You used to hear when they didn’t think I’d be able to pull it off and that was a tough one. They were willing to close up the country over the wall. So I had a party, totally strong party, bad politics, but strong party. Bad policy, but they didn’t want a wall. But I made a really terrible mistake. I should have said instead of we will build a wall, I should have said, “We will not build a wall,” and they would have given me all the money. They would’ve said, “We demand that you build it immediately.” But then they said, “Walls don’t work.” And I said, “No walls work and wheels work. Those are the two things that work.” Everything else gets obsolete in about 15 minutes after it’s discovered. Biden wants to terminate our travel bans and surge refugees from the most dangerous places in the world. He will open the flood gates to radical Islamic terrorism. And you saw what happened three days ago, the beheading in France, and today it happened again. And we give our warmest regards to President McCrone, a friend of ours, a friend of mine, a friend of the first lady. They’re two great people. First lady of France is a great woman. Under the Biden plan, the horrifying attacks in France will come to our cities and our towns. And I don’t want to speak too loudly about this and I knock on wood. This is real wood. This is real wood. I can tell anything having to do with the White House and the president’s real wood somewhere. Oh yeah, here, let me knock on this piece. That’s definitely. Look at what’s happened long time, right. I don’t want to say long time. And the first call I get after we win, the first call I get will be from Iran. They’re going to want to make a deal because their country has been devastated. They have been unable to give money to terrorist organizations that they’ve given routinely for years. Their GDP is down 27% this year, which is the highest anybody’s ever seen of any country in one year. Think of it. We’re up 33.1 and they’re down 27 and they’re going to want to make a deal and we want to make a deal if we can. We want them to be a great country, but they cannot have a nuclear weapon. They cannot have a nuclear weapon. And we’re going to help them. We’re going to help them. We’re going to go with them and help them and do whatever we have to do and I hope happens, but I believe that. And I even said, “Don’t deal with them now. They’re going to want to see what happens with Sleepy Joe,” because if he won, China will own us. Iran will make another crazy deal where they give them 150 billion or 1.8 billion in cash. Think of that. We have so many things that what we’ve done, the deals that we’ve made. It’s very scary to see. I watch it and I say, “There has to be something wrong because nobody can be that stupid. Nobody can be that stupid.” Under my leadership, we’re keeping the terrorist, extremist, and violent criminals the hell out of our country if that’s okay, if that’s okay with you. Some of you might object because you have that nice liberal point of view, but if that’s okay with you, we’ll keep them the hell out. We invested $2.5 trillion in the US military, including 11.2 million. Figure this, $11.2 million right here MacDill Air Force Base. Has anybody heard of MacDill? Has anybody in the audience? Mr. Congressman, you’re the one that got it in [inaudible 00:07:05]. Waltz. And we also passed veteran’s choice and veteran’s accountability. They all said it was impossible. They said it was impossible. And we took 100% of the ISIS caliphate, destroyed it. And we killed the leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi, who they were looking for for 17 years. Al-Baghdadi is dead. And then we took out the world’s number one terrorist by far, the worst in 50 years, Qasem Soleimani is dead. He killed many of our soldiers. He killed many soldiers from many continents, most feared man in the Middle East. He’s gone. I withdrew from the last administration’s horrible Iran nuclear deal. I recognized the capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem and got the building built for a tiny fraction. You know that story, right? Tiny fraction. I called up our great ambassador, David Friedman. I said, “David, let’s see if we can get it open.” They wanted to spend $2 billion to build an embassy and it would have never happened. I said, “David, go around. Do we have any land that we own? We’re the government. We own everything, right, even in other countries. See what we have.” He calls me back the following day. He says, “Sir, we own a great piece, much better than the piece they were going to buy.” We didn’t buy it because I didn’t like it. I didn’t like the location. Does that make sense because I’m in the real estate business? I didn’t like location. Location’s very important. I said, “See what we have.” He said, “Sir, we have a piece that’s much bigger. It’s in a much better location and it has a building.” Now remember, we’re going to spend between a billion and $2 billion. I said, “Well, what’s the building?” He said, “The building is a building that’s basically unoccupied. It’s pretty big. We could fix it up.” I said, “How much?” He said, “Let me get back to you.” He gets back to me two days later. Sir, I think we could do it for 390,000, right. Right. Do you understand that Mr. Congress? So I said, “It’s the first time I’ve ever done this.” I said, “David, that doesn’t sound good. It sounds too cheap. Make it a little more, make it 500.” And we did. We did it for 500,000 and it’s Jerusalem. And a friend of mine, Ron Baron, he’s so proud of a wall opposite the elevator. Every time I walk in he shows me Jerusalem stone. I go crazy. Ron, I don’t care. I said, “David, you’re in Jerusalem. It’s very expensive in New York. Can you get Jerusalem stone?” He said, “Yes we can. We have it. We can buy it for nothing.” I said, “Good. Make the building out of Jerusalem stone.” So he made it out of Jerusalem stone. We had it opened four months later for $500, 000. Not only would it have cost more than $2 million, you wouldn’t have that building built for 25 years. So we did something a little different. We got something done for a tiny, tiny fraction of what it was supposed to cost. And we had it open in three and a half, four months. And it’s now our embassy. It’s a great embassy and it’s recognized. Jerusalem is the capital of Israel. Sort of a great story. And I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. They’ve been working on that for 52 years. We got it done in two hours and it’s not easy. And every president wanted to do those two things for many, many decades, but they couldn’t. And I understand why they couldn’t. A lot of pressure, a lot of pressure against. And instead of never ending wars in the Middle East, we’re forging peace deals all over the place. You see it. No blood in the sand, no blood in the sand. No cause. Biden and Obama made a pathetic one-sided deal with the Castro dictatorship. My opponent stands with socialists and communists. I stand with the proud people of Cuba and Nicaragua and Venezuela in their righteous struggle for freedom and we’re winning. We’re winning it. It’s going to be easy. We’re winning. The last administration also negotiated the terrible Obama Biden Santos deal with Colombian drug cartels, surrendering to the Narco terrorists. You know what that means? That means drugs. Our first lady sits on our commission. She chairs the commission of drugs and on drugs in America and how to get rid of it. It’s a blue ribbon commission, right. And we’re down 19%. We had a little setback with the recent problem with the China virus, but it’s getting back under control, but she’s taking it down 19. She and the commission have taken it down 19%. And she doesn’t want it mentioned. She doesn’t want to talk about it. She doesn’t want to talk about it. See if it would be sitting in her position, I’d be holding a news conference. I have done an incredible job. No, I’m only kidding. I’m only kidding. I’m only kidding. But she has done an incredible job. Thank you honey. Thank you. Thank you very much. Under my administration, we worked with Colombian officials to seize or disrupt 227 tons of poisonous narcotics since April alone. The fact is I’ve done more in 47 months than Sleepy Joe Biden has done in 47 years. It’s true. It’s true. No administration in the first 3 and a half years has done what this administration has done. We’ve rebuilt our military. We’ve done the biggest tax cut in history, biggest regulation cut in history. What we’ve done is incredible, even environmentally. I’ll tell you what. We’re not going to go over a list, we’d be here all day, but no administration. And the fake news doesn’t even call me on it. Usually, if you make a statement, they think it’s 1% off. It’s a headline the next day. In the coming weeks, we will distribute a vaccine, defeat the virus, and complete the great American comeback. We’re in the process. A vote for Republicans like these people right down here is a vote for the great American dream. That’s what it is. I remember Abraham Lincoln, the great, the legendary Abraham Lincoln was a Republican. Would you please remember that? Nobody knows that. They know it now because I like to say it. Over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we will end our reliance on China once and for all. It’s already started. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. We will defend religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms. Your 2nd Amendment will be defended. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. And I told you, we spent two and a half trillion with a T, trillion dollars, trillion on our military. We have to finest rockets, the finest missiles, the finest jets, F-35s. We have the finest tanks and submarines and ships all made in the USA. And our nuclear stockpile, we are in a position like no other country in the world. We are the envy of every country, Russia, China, North Korea. No country in the world has what we have. And just a lot of religious people in this audience, pray to God that we never have to use it. And it’s more likely that we won’t have to use it now that we have it, but just hope that we never have to use it. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency, lower drug prices even more, and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. That’s already happening Nest. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto in God we trust. For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now, you have a president who’s standing up for America and standing up for the great people of Florida. So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your boss. Pull them out of their chair. Come on, boss. And you got to get out and vote. There’s never been an election more important. On November 3rd, we must finish the job and drain the rest of the swamp. We’ve done a lot of it. From Pensacola to Miami, from Orlando to Jacksonville, and from Tallahassee to right here in Tampa, we inherit the legacy of… You know it, right? We inherit the incredible legacy of Florida Patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for this beloved nation. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blazed the trails, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, laid down the railroads, dug out the Panama Canal, raised up the great skyscrapers, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism. And from right here in this beautiful state, landed our brave American astronauts on the face of the moon. You’ve done a lot. We made America into the single greatest nation in the history of the world and the best is yet to come. Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We’re winning. We are winning again. We are winning again. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of Florida, we have made America powerful again. We have made America wealthy again. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again. We have made America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Florida. Get out and vote. Thank you.

"101","10-30-20","All right. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Appreciate it, and hello, Rochester. Great to be with you. Four days from now, we’re going to win the state of Minnesota. I did not forget you because we were given a very, very hard time by your so-called leaders, but they’re not very good leaders as you found out during the riots, and we’re going to win four more years at our great White House. Thank you. As you know, there are at least 25,000 people who wanted to be here tonight. We just saw a lot of them. Wanted to pay our respects. They were here for a long time. They waited and waited, and then the governor did bad things. Your far-left Democrat Attorney General, Keith Ellison, and your Democrat governor tried to shut down our rally, silence the people of Minnesota and take away your freedom and your rights. They thought he would cancel. A word they are very familiar with, cancel. Cancel culture. But I said, “No way, I will never abandon the people of Minnesota. I will come up. I will come up.” Thousands and thousands of people over there with cars. We flew over cars that go miles long. What a shame. They waited here for a long time. I want to thank the thousands of people outside who were barred from entry by radical Democrats. You are American patriots. Thank you very much. When large numbers of rioters and vandals sacked the city of Minneapolis earlier this year, Keith Ellison did not ask them to submit a permit. He told the throngs of violent demonstrators, “By all means, exercise your first amendment rights.” He said that prior to them ripping down your city. Keith Ellison sided with flag-burning extremists over law-abiding Americans. He treats you like second class citizens. He believes that the pro-American voters have fewer rights than anti-American demonstrators. Keith Ellison and Joe Biden want to imprison you in your homes while letting anarchists, agitators and vandals roam free as they destroy your cities and states. The Democrat party wants you to be banned from peaceful assembly while they allow their supporters to burn down a police precinct right here. Biden and the far left incite violence with their vile anti-police rhetoric, and the fact that they’re weak people, very, very weak people. They allow rioters to lay waste to the public streets that financed… And they were financed by you with your hard-earned taxpayer dollars. The radical left is determined to obliterate the middle-class. They think they can take your money, attack your values, indoctrinate your children and silence your voices. But on November 3rd, I hope you’re listening, Minnesota, because this is what you’ve had to put up with for a long time. The people of our nation are going to be heard like never before. It’s already begun. People are already starting to find out what’s happening because they’re going to show up and vote in record numbers. You have already started to see what’s going on. They’re getting very concerned. We’re not just running against Sleepy Joe Biden. We’re running against the arrogant far-left political class. They want one set of rules for you and no rules for themselves. Biden and the left wing Democrats treat law enforcement like criminals, and they treat criminals like heroes. They lecture you on morality while they support sanctuary cities that get innocent Americans robbed, raped, maimed, and murdered. They ban you from going to church while they let left wing extremists burned down the church. They support crippling shutdowns that crush blue collar jobs while their own jobs remain totally exempt. They keep your kids out of school while their families hire private tutors. They flood your cities with illegal drugs and gangs while they live inside walled off compounds. They want to destroy and work hard to destroy the suburbs, which I’m protecting, and terminating horrible rules and regulations that only pertain to the suburbs while they move into gated communities with armed guards. These wealthy liberal hypocrites want to defund the police and take your guns while they are protected by armed guards. There’s only one way to defend your dignity. There’s only one way to defend your family and your country. There’s only one way to preserve, protect, and defend the American way of life. You must show up and vote on November 3rd. In the second term, we will increase funding for law enforcement. We will hire more tough on crime prosecutors to put violent offenders behind bars. We will finish and win the war against MS-13 killers. We’ve taken thousands out of our country and brought them back where they came from. We will put them all out of business. We will completely dismantle antifa, and we will reclaim our streets for law-abiding Americans of every race, color, religion, and creed. These are streets that have been run by Democrats, not Republicans, and it’s taken too long for them to gain control of those streets. We will do all of this, and so much more, only with your vote. You have a very important vote, and this state in particular. 1972. This is a state. You’ve been poorly run for too long. You want law and order also. On November 3rd, vote to defeat Joe Biden and save your great American dream and save your wonderful American freedom. Biden is a grimy, sleazy and corrupt career politician. We found that out. A lot of people have known it for a long time. Who’s done nothing but betray you for 47 years. All he’s done in that time is sell out to lobbyists, sell out to China. China owns him. Sell out to big pharma and sell out to foreign countries. He will look you in the eye and then turn right around and stab you in the back and be totally protected by the mainstream media. The only thing he cares about is political power, and he will use that power to hurt you and to enrich his cronies and his friends, and most of all, to enrich his family. A vote for Joe Biden is a vote to put far-left radicals like Keith Ellison and Ilhan Omar and AOC plus three. And gun grabber Beto O’Rourke wants to take your guns away, wants to destroy your Second Amendment, [inaudible 00:10:03] positions controlling the entire federal government. And then they want to pack the courts. They want to pack those courts, the Supreme Court. They want to put radical Justices who will confiscate your guns, terminate your religious liberty, erase all of your borders and stifle life. If you want strong borders, strong families, safe communities, and a thriving economy, then I am asking you to go out on November 3rd and vote for your all time favorite president. One of-Thank you. One of the most crucial issues for Minnesota in this election is the subject of refugees. This is a vital matter of national security to protect our country. I issued a directive suspending the entry of refugees from foreign nations compromised by terrorism, terrorism like you’ve never seen before, including from Syria, Somalia, and Yemen. We’re keeping radical Islamic terrorists out of our country. I spoke to President Macron of France yesterday and put out my warmest sympathy for what they’ve been through over the last four days with terrorist attacks, the likes of which few have seen. Biden has pledged a staggering 700% increase in refugees from the most dangerous and violent terrorist hotspots anywhere in the world. He has also vowed to terminate our national security travel bans, which I fought very hard to get, which I won in the Supreme Court, allowing for unlimited migration from war zones and terrorist havens. He said, “Bring them in.” Biden’s deadly migration policies will overwhelm Minnesota and overwhelm taxpayers and open the flood gates to terrorists, jihadists, and violent extremists. Under my administration, the safety of our families will always come first. America first, our families first. With your support, we will continue to bring back your jobs, cut your taxes, cut regulations, support our great police, support our military, defend our borders, protect our Second Amendment, which is totally under siege, but don’t worry. As long as I’m here, nothing’s happening with it. Protect religious liberty and ensure more products are proudly stamped with the very wonderful and beautiful phrase, Made in the USA. Yesterday it was announced that last quarter, our economy grew at the fastest rate ever recorded in the history of our country, 33.1%. People were shocked. I wasn’t. Biggest increase in the history of our country by far. 1952, but it was a rate less than half. We are creating an economic powerhouse, a super power the likes of which the world has never seen before. We are building the biggest, strongest and most prosperous middle-class in human history. I am fighting for higher wages, more jobs, more opportunity, and we will keep it right there and we will bring it right here to the USA where it belongs. Joe Biden has never succeeded before. Barack Obama said that if you want to see things screwed up, just ask Joe Biden to do it. Joe Biden will ship your factories to China, impose a $4 trillion tax hike, eliminate private healthcare, abolish the entire oil industry and fracking, and send your state into a crippling depression. Biden’s anti-energy, anti-worker policies would be a nightmare for Latino and African American workers all across our land. Biden will also continue his 47 years of cruelly betraying African Americans. He called them super predators in 1994, ripped apart their communities and did everything in his power to wipe out the black middle-class. They understand it better than anybody, and I think you’ll probably see that at the voter booth. They understand what he’s done better than anybody. “Super predators,” he said. Now Biden wants to wipe out the entire U.S. economy for black Americans, Hispanic Americans, and all Americans. He has no idea what he’s doing. He wants to give you the largest tax increase in the history of our country, by far. Joe Biden’s plan will delay the vaccine, postpone therapies, crash the economy and shut down our entire country. Under the Biden lockdown, which he talks about and cherishes, countless Americans will die from suicide, drug overdoses and deferred medical care at a level like you haven’t seen before. There will be no school, no graduations, no weddings, no Thanksgiving, no Christmas, no 4th of July, no Easter, no nothing. There will be no future for America’s youth. Under my plan, we will deliver a safe vaccine to the American people in just a matter of weeks, and it will be something that will be very, very special. We are rounding the turn on the pandemic with or without vaccine. We have the vaccine. It’s going to come, but even without it, we’re rounding the turn. Seniors will be first in line to get it, and it will be available free. It wasn’t their fault. It wasn’t our fault. It was the fault of China, who should have kept it within their limits. Our vaccine will eradicate the virus and the pandemic, and it will end, quickly restore normal life, that’s what we want is normal life. Take us back seven months. Normal life. Record setting everything in a normal life. Next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country. We will wipe out the China plague once and for all. We’re joined today by Congressman Jim Hagedorn and Congressman Tom Emmer. Thank you, fellas. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thanks, Jim, Tom. They’re great warriors. They’ve been with me all the way. And congressional candidate, somebody that’s really outstanding. I think you two agree, right? You two agree. Michelle Fischbach. Great job. I saw you in the debate. You did a fantastic job. Thank you, Michelle. Great job. State Senator Paul Gazelka. Paul, thank you. Thank you, Paul. State Representative Kurt Daudt. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Kurt. Like your hat. And GOP chair, Jennifer Carnahan. Thank you, Jennifer. Are we doing well, Jennifer? I think we’re going to win. 1972, and you have been treated very, very badly. In addition, friend of mine, Mike Lindell. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mike. Thank you very much. Great job. Great job. And former… Oh, this is a big one, really. Matt Birk, Minnesota Viking superstar. Really, huh? Look at him. You look like you could play tomorrow. Thank you very much, Matt. Great honor to meet you. Another vital issue in this race is the Minnesota Iron Range. I brought it back to life. It was dead. It was closed. It was sealed and you weren’t going to use it for anything. As vice president, Joe Biden tried to obliterate the Iron Range. Seven plants were idled. The rest were closing very shortly and they were bad. There was barely a whimper. I brought the Iron Range roaring back to life. I have friends that live in Minnesota. They said it was so unfair. When it was closed. A man came up to me. I don’t know who he was, but he was a strong, big, powerful man, and he was crying and he said, “They’ve taken my life away when they closed the Iron Range.” Well, I opened it. That was the most convincing of all. Everybody wanted me to do it. But when I saw him, I said, “There’s no doubt about it.” It’s fully opened and ready and really doing phenomenally and it has the best iron, they say, anywhere in the world, but you had it closed. So it’s great. Congratulations. Congratulations. It was my honor. That area’s now thriving. It’s thriving. It was desolate. It’s now thriving. Nine Democrat mayors in the Iron Range have endorsed me because they know Biden will shut down the Iron Range forever. By the way, they will shut it down as fast as I opened it up and they’ll shut it down permanently the next time. They said, “We made a mistake. We didn’t do it through legislature. We made a mistake.” They will shut it down permanently. So I hope you remember that. I just hope you remember that, especially on November 3rd. Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure border in American history. Biden’s plan to admit unlimited low-wage foreign workers will slash income, surge unemployment, and devastate your middle-class, all to enrich his globalist donors. He raises money like crazy because he’s making deals. They’re giving him millions of dollars. I could raise much more than him, but I don’t want to be compromised. I won’t be compromised and we don’t need the money. We don’t need the money. That’s how they’ve raised all of that money, because they’re making deals with Wall Street. As President, I will only advance immigration policies that put American workers and families first. You, the American people, are my only special interests. That’s why I did this. I had a very nice life before doing this, I have to tell you. I will continue fighting for you harder than anyone has ever done before. The forgotten men and women of our country will never, ever be forgotten again, and you know that, and you saw that. Four years ago we had a very, very exciting time. This is even more exciting, and frankly, this is a more important election, and I never thought I’d be saying that. A vote for me and the Republican party is a vote for the American dream. So Minnesota, that very important time has finally arrived. This is it. This is the history of our nation. This is a very, very big moment for our country. This Tuesday or sooner, get out and vote. Every one of you. Remember what your governor did this evening, and it’s a small thing, but a horrible thing to thousands and thousands of people that are outside that could be here. We could all be together. A horrible thing that they did. Your state and your country depend on you. We depend on your vote. We depend on your loyalty and you have my loyalty. That you know, and that you found out. Together we are going to make history. On November 3rd, we’re going to make history and this will be very special for Minnesota. People have been talking about it for years, but it never quite works out. Even with me, we lost by half a point. One more stop. I should’ve come one more time. Just one more time, but you know what? It’s not going to matter because we’re going to have an even bigger victory on November 3rd. So I want to thank you. God bless you. God bless Minnesota and God bless America. Thank you for being here. We appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you, Tom. Thank you, Mike. Thank you, everybody. Nice seeing you, Matt. Good job. Thank you, everybody.

"102","10-31-20","Wow, good crowd. This is a hell of a crowd. Thank you. Thank you. Wow. Well, I just want to say hello, Pennsylvania, and hello, Montoursvile. How are you? We love this state. I’ve done a little traveling in this state today you might have heard, but we save the best for last. Right? It’s a great place. I went to school here, went to college here, and it’s a great place. Three days from now, we are going to win the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and we are going to win four more great years in the White House and, with your vote, we will continue to bring back your jobs, cut your taxes, cut regulations, support our great military, take care of our veterans and nobody’s done it better than we have, work with our police, our police officers, and ensure that more products are proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase “Made in the USA”. It’s been a long time since you heard that kind of stuff. Next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country on the assumption you don’t quadruple your taxes. Okay? It’s the only guy I’ve ever seen, his old campaign theme, “We will raise your taxes.” What the hell kind of a campaign? My whole life I’ve seen people campaign. I’ve never heard that one before, but it’s a little bit of a different kind of a campaign, wouldn’t you say? Sleepy Joe Biden will shut down your economy, ship your jobs to China, where he’s very well taken care of. You never hear it from them. That’s a lot of media. You’ll never hear it from the fake media. Raise your taxes $4 trillion dollars, destroy the suburbs and we’re saving the suburbs. I hope the people of the suburbs know that. I hope the people in the suburbs know that. I ended a regulation. If they re-enact it, you won’t have suburbs anymore and send your state into a deep and crippling depression. Biden has vowed to abolish American oil and natural gas. You saw that. No fracking, no mining, no coal, no nothing. And gas prices for your beautiful large vans and cars and trucks … Some of you have trucks that you drive around in because you like that better. I think I’d be one of those. I think I’d be one of those people, but don’t you like $2 gasoline? Isn’t that nice? Well, it’ll go to $6, $7 and then you’ll be telling your family, “Let’s buy one of those little compacts that we used to buy.” Right? Biden’s plan is an economic death sentence for Pennsylvania. He’ll outlaw fracking and what we’re going to do, we’re going to stop it. We’re going to stop it. We have a little thing up there. Where is it? Right there. That cost a lot of money to get. We get that for special … You’re going to see a little bit about fracking. But all of that great stuff, your natural gas in Pennsylvania, and they’ll obliterate and extinguish your economy as sure as you’re standing and/or sitting. Do you have chairs? Yeah, you do but everybody’s standing. That’s very nice. Today I signed an order and this is semi- breaking news. I did say it at the last stop, but I won’t tell you that. But today I signed an order just now on the plane to strongly protect your state’s energy and fracking industry. I just signed it. I just signed it. We have an order so that people cannot play with your fracking industry. You know, you have a million people and you are a big contributor to the rest of the country. You’re a tremendous contributor to the rest of the country. They can’t play with it. Biden said for a year, “There’ll be no fracking, no fracking.” He must have said it a hundred times. Then he lucks out because Elizabeth Warren refused to get out of the race. So Bernie … that’s the second time. Is Bernie running again, fake news? Could you tell us is Bernie … Bernie’s going to run again in four years. He’s going to get it. Actually, we thought it might be Bernie, right? More intelligence although, I don’t know, with a policy like that, I don’t call that great intelligence. Right, Congressman? If Biden and Harris get in, they will terminate this executive order and implement the green new deal conceived and dedicated by AOC who probably never took a course on the environment. Do you think she ever took one little course like 101, Environment 101? I doubt it. It’ll change our whole country around. Well, it’s not going to happen. It’s so ridiculous, $100 trillion dollars, I don’t think so. A vote for Biden and Harris is a vote to ban fracking, ban mining and completely destroy Pennsylvania and it’s true, by the way. It’s not going to happen. First of all, we’re going to win. You got to get out and vote. We’re going to win. A vote for me is a vote to remain energy … we’re energy independent now. Think of it. Energy independent. Our economy is now growing at the fastest rate ever recorded, 33.1%, and the fake news doesn’t want to talk about it. And a friend of mine, a great financier, called up and he said, “Hey, how you doing? This is the greatest number maybe ever put out economically, GDP 33. 1. Nobody’s ever heard of it and they hardly” … He said, “I can’t believe this isn’t a much bigger story.” I said, “That’s the way it is. They don’t want that kind of thing to get out.” It’s one of the greatest numbers ever revealed in the history of our country. The second number I think was 1952 and it was less than half the 33.1. So we have not a V anymore. We have a Super V and that’s where we’re going unless somebody comes along and says, “Let’s quadruple your taxes. Let’s put all those regulations back.” In the past five months, we’ve created a record 11.4 million American jobs. That’s another … I mean think of it, it’s never been done before and while foreign nations are in a free fall and you see that and we don’t want that, but you see what’s going on is COVID or the China virus or the China plague. There’s about 21 different names. We’re creating the world’s greatest economic powerhouse and next year will be one of the greatest years, maybe the best year that we’ve ever had based on what’s happening. A recent Gallup poll found, just out, that 56% of Americans say they are better off today than they were four years ago with Obama and Biden. And that’s rounding the turn, but that’s during a pandemic, 56%, that’s a record number, 56. You’re better off today than you were four years ago with Obama and I watched him today. They draw flies, both of them. I thought maybe they put them together. They drew a couple of horns, honk, honk, honk, and most of them are our people that are taunting. Did anybody see the picture of their crazy bus driving down the highway that’s surrounded by like hundreds of cars? And they’re all Trump flags all over the place. It’s like a hot, it’s like a hot thing. See, that’s really number one trending. They won’t put that. That’s number one, trending. They come up with number one, trending. It’s not a trend. It’s whatever they want to do. You look at Big Tech. You look at what’s been happening lately, right? You look at the media where they refuse to cover one of the biggest scandals, no, but the biggest scandal is we caught them spying on our campaign. Right? We caught them trying to overthrow a duly elected, commonly known as me, President of the United States. Let’s see what happens. Let’s see what happens. Very dishonest people. You’re right. Well, that you’re right. You know, there are a lot of people that call that treason. Okay. That’s treason. Let’s see what happens. If Biden gets in, the economy will collapse. Joe Biden is a diehard globalist who spent the last 47 years outsourcing your jobs, opening your borders and sacrificing American blood and treasure in endless foreign wars in countries that many of you have never even heard of. I didn’t hear of too many of them either if you want to know the truth. Biden is a Washington vulture who decimated your steel mills, annihilated your coal jobs and supported every disastrous sellout trade deal for over a half a century. You know what’s happened. You know what I had to do with the dumped steel all over the place. They’re dumping steel. I put big tariffs on it. All of a sudden, the steel mills started doing good. It was a beautiful thing. And we took some of that money, $28 billion dollars we took, and we gave it to our farmers because they were targeted by China and our farmers like me. Our farmers like me. In fact, they just came out with the Des Moines Register poll … Did you see it? We’re way ahead in Iowa. We’re way ahead in Florida. We’re way ahead in Ohio, way ahead in Ohio. We’re doing great in Georgia. Texas, don’t even talk, they say Texas is in play. I had the same thing four years ago. Here’s a guy he’s against oil, he’s against guns and he’s against God. I don’t think that plays well in Texas. And you know where else it doesn’t play too well? In a place called Pennsylvania. No, think of it. Okay, you have Texas, oil, guns, religion, God, religion. So he’s against … Think of it. And then they say, “It’s too close to call.” No, we’re leading by a lot. Same thing happened last time four years ago, “It’s too close to call.” It’s not too close to call. And then the polls close. Remember last time? The doors close, the polls close, and they say, “Texas, the doors have closed, the polls have closed in Texas. Donald Trump has won the state of Texas.” By a lot. Oh, I had many of them. I had many of them. I mean I have them now but actually they’re better now than they were four years ago. Four years ago, it was like hopeless except for one thing. Nobody believed it and they went out and they voted and all of a sudden they took this thing. Did you see ever see The New York Times? It had a little column, “The chance of winning,” and I think it started at like 4%. And then as the evening went by and we won state after state. “Donald Trump has won the state of Florida. Donald Trump has won Georgia. Donald Trump has won South Carolina. Donald Trump has won North Carolina. Donald… We’re just running the East Coast, right? And it goes 3%, 6%, 9%. Right? And the chance is 15%, then it started getting into the 50s, then the 60s, and that’s where they started to go totally crazy. Remember that convention? Remember the convention hall? And then you had a couple of non-biased news anchors that started to cry. Did anybody see the debate? No, nobody, right? That last debate we had, right? Did you all… I felt like Perry Mason, because the last question, I said, “You mean you want to get rid of the oil and gas industry?” “No, we would like to transition out of it.” I said, “This is the biggest moment.” It was like… You know Perry Mason? It was always that last question, right? No, no, I didn’t do it. I didn’t. Yes, I did it. I did it. That was Sleepy Joe. I said, “This is the biggest moment.” And even the anchor, Kristen, she looks up at him, she goes, “Why did you say that?” Obviously being on his side, she can’t believe that he said it, but that’s because he’s not too smart. Biden was a cheerleader for NAFTA and China’s entry into the World Trade Organization, which is one of the worst things that ever happened. To us. Not to China. Eliminating half of your manufacturing jobs, many of them came from right here. At every turn, Biden twisted his knife into the backs of Pennsylvania workers. And during that debate, he’d say, “Well, why didn’t you do this?” I said, “Why didn’t you do it? You just left.” “Why didn’t you do that?” “Why didn’t you do it, Joe?” That was like the easiest debate I’ve ever had. While Biden was giving China your jobs, his family was raking in millions and millions of dollars from the Chinese Communist Party. Joe Biden is a corrupt politician, okay? When his son considered a board of Burisma and get $183,000 a month… Now, think of is, right? Think of this. If Biden wins, China wins. When we win, America wins. That’s what we’re here for. And you don’t have to take my word for it because I like this group, and I love this state. I spent a lot of money on that crazy board up there. Why don’t you watch this? Be careful. Ah, Joe, this could only happen to me. This could only happen…Thank you. Thank you. In 2016, Pennsylvania voted to fire this corrupt political establishment, and you elected an outsider’s president who is finally putting America first. That’s okay, right? And if I don’t sound like a typical Washington politician, it’s because I’m not a politician. I guess that’s why I got elected. If I don’t always play by the rules of Washington and the Washington establishment, it’s because I was elected to fight for you, and I fight harder for you than any president has ever fought. I believe that. One of the most important issues in this election is law and order. And you know about it well, you see what’s going on in your large city. It’s not good. Now you have great police, but they’re not allowed to do their job. This week, violent mobs of Biden supporters ransacked Philadelphia. Now, four members of the city council are pushing very hard to defund the Philadelphia police. They’re defunding the police. And they’re pushing very hard, and it could happen. It could happen. We’re watching. I don’t think we’ll let it happen. At some point, we can’t let it happen. If Biden and Harris are elected, they will pass legislation to slash police funding. They’re already trying to do it all over the country. Well, except in Republican cities and states, which are running beautifully without crime. Our opponents stand with the… Take a look at it. The rioters and the anarchists and the looters. We stand, we, we stand with the heroes of law enforcement. We’ve been endorsed by almost every major law enforcement group in the country, Florida, Texas, New York’s finest endorse us. First time they’ve ever endorsed a presidential candidate. The Chicago police, that’s not easy to do, they endorsed. We have endorsements from everybody. During the debate, I said, “Joe, what law group, any police group, anybody looking for law and order, did anybody endorse you?” He couldn’t answer the question. Then he was bailed out by the anchor, right? He was bailed out. I said, “Joe, say the words, ‘law and order.'” He wouldn’t do it. He didn’t want to lose the radical left. I’m not just running against Joe Biden. I’m running against the left-wing media, the big tech giants, the RINOs, you know what a RINO is, right? Republican-in-name-only. We got a couple of them. There aren’t too many of them left. They’re on respirators, actually. And the Washington swamp, which is much deeper and much more vicious than we ever thought even possible. On Tuesday, November 3rd, and maybe you do it sooner, but I think this group wants November 3rd, it’s called Election Day…Of course, now that our United States Supreme Court has delayed everything, it’s going to be a very interesting evening. And I wonder what happens during that period of delay with the ballots. I wonder what happens. Are they going to mysteriously find more ballots, Mr. Congressmen? Are they going to find more ballots? Can you imagine what happened? Can you imagine? Just be very careful, be vigilant and watch, and report whatever you see. Because this state, we love it. Went to school here, right? Went to college. We love it. But strange things have been known to happen, especially in Philadelphia. So send them a message that they’ll never forget. This election is a choice between a Biden depression and a Trump super boom. We’re going to have a boom. We’re going to have the greatest economy ever. It’s a choice between a deadly Biden lockdown. You know he wants to lock it down. And by the way, tell your governor to open up your state, please. Can you believe it? Can you believe it? And open up your schools and get it going. It’s terrible. This one, Michigan. How about her? The only one that’s allowed to roam free in Michigan is her husband. He can do whatever the hell he wants. Nobody else can. In North Carolina, same thing. They got a great state, great people. They have it locked down. It’s just crazy. By the way, on November 4th, he’ll announce, “Ladies and gentlemen, we’ve decided to open up.” See, he thinks he’s hurting us politically. And then we have a number like 33.1. It might’ve been 34.1, okay? I don’t think that would’ve made too much of a difference, but he’s hurting a lot of people. It’s a choice between a deadly lockdown and a safe vaccine that ends the pandemic with or without the vaccine. And we’re going to have the vaccine. We have the greatest companies in the world, Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna and others. And we’re weeks away from a vaccine. And we’re going to give the vaccine. We’re going to have it transported by our military all over, logistics all over the country. And it’s going to be great. And it’s going to be given to our seniors first. I think they have to get it first. And our frontline workers. Free. Free. You know why it’s free? Because it wasn’t their fault. It was China’s fault. And it will quickly eradicate the China virus. But with or without it, it’s going to go away, and we are rounding… It drives them crazy, the fake news media, it’s going away. And if you look at Europe, you look what’s happening over in Europe, they’d always use that as, “Look at Europe.” Well, take a look at Europe, they have a problem, a big problem, and we don’t want that to happen. Thanks to our groundbreaking therapies, our excess mortality rate is 40% lower than Europe’s. And right now, cases are surging in Europe, despite draconian lockdowns, they’d been locking down, and it didn’t help them much, that are spreading misery and suffering and destroying those nations. For months, democrats celebrated as left-wing rioters took to the streets by the thousands. You’re allowed to riot. They don’t ask about masks. You’re allowed to riot. You’re allowed to go through, loot and burn stores, burn down your main streets, burn down the greatest, beautiful, the most beautiful shopping streets. You can do whatever. They could walk out with televisions. Did you see the guy walking out with dishwashers? He’s pushing it along the pavement. And the police had told, “Don’t do anything. Stand back, stand back. No, we can’t do it.” Our opponents do not believe in science. They want unlimited power over you and your family. They got to open it up. The so-called experts advising Joe Biden have called for slowing down the vaccine. Can you believe this? Now, if it weren’t, in my opinion, so political, they just didn’t want to have it come out before the election. But everybody knows it’s right there, and we’re ready to go, but it became a big political thing. And they were actually trying to discourage people from taking it. That’s so bad and so stupid and so dangerous. And these are great companies. These are the greatest companies in the world. They’re not listening to anybody, but there are people. And we do. We have a great … well, soon, very soon be distributed, this great vaccine, but they’re willing to hurt our country in order to try and make sure that it doesn’t. Because we’re not looking for credit. We’re looking to save lives. We’re looking to help our country, help your state, help our country. That’s what we’re looking to do. Denying priority to elderly patients. They want to deny the priority, imposing crippling lockdowns that will cause quote “Really serious pain. They’ve said that. One of the politicians said it, “Really serious pain.” The Biden lockdown will imprison you and your home while looters roam free. But you’ve already gone through that, in all fairness. You’re going through it right now. They just don’t open up the state. Congressmen, you got to get going on this. I’ll tell you, you got to get going on this. We have great congressmen here. We got to get going on this. Under Biden, there will be no school, no graduations, no weddings, no Thanksgivings, no Easters, no Christmases and no 4th of July. Other than that, you’ve got to have a wonderful life. No, think of this guy, ruined American youth. It’s been shown that telehealth has been amazing, with the computers, with the laptops. It’s been great. It’s up like 8000%. The truth is, it’s great. But you know, children, this has been proven now, because we’ve had the ultimate test, children have to go to school. They have to be with other kids. They have to be with classmates, and they don’t catch it. Barron Trump, my very tall son, he’s strong, and he’s young. And the doctor said, “Yes, sir. He tested positive.” I said, “Doctor, tested positive for what?” He said, “For COVID.” He used the COVID word, right? Could he used 21 other words, but he used COVID. And I said, “Oh, that’s terrible.” Doctor said, “Don’t worry about it. He’ll be all right.” 12 minutes later, the doctor called, “Barron’s okay now, sir.” He threw it off. Because they’re young. They have great immune systems, stronger than you, or you, or you. That guy, definitely stronger than him. And they got to go back to school. Okay? They got to go back to school. Open up. Open up Pennsylvania. Governor. If you want a vaccine to kill the virus, a job to support your family and freedom to live your life the way you want to live your life, vote for a person named President Donald J. Trump. Have you ever heard of him? Of the Republican party. So joining us today are some really great, I mean, really great, warriors, and they are Congressman Fred Keller. Fred, thank you. Thank you very much. Central casting. Doing a great job. Thank you. And Congressman Dan Meuser. Dan, thank you very much. Thank you. Great people, great people. They worked with us on the impeachment hoax. Now it turned out that it was really a hoax, because they found out that I was right when I spoke to the president, right? I told him, I said, “If you see anything wrong, please call the Attorney General of the United States.” And they had plenty wrong. You look at Biden. He got caught. They call that the laptop from hell. Where’s Hunter? Where is Hunter? Remember the tee-shirt we made, “Where’s Hunter?” Ah, boy, Hunter. We also have a fantastic person who is running for a congressional seat and who’s doing very well, I understand, Jim Bognet. Where is Jim? Jim, I hear it’s going well, going good. Get out and vote for this guy. He’s a star. He’s going to be great. And a former Congressman who’s been a right early supporter, a great one, Tom Marino. Thank you, Tom. When are you getting back? Come on back. Okay? Great one, and we have another great one. Nobody ever heard of him. Lou Barletta. These are great people. They’re incredible people. Thank you both. That’s great that you’re here. And state treasurer candidate, Stacy Garrity. Stacy. Thank you, Stacy. I hear you’re doing well, Stacy. I think the Republican party is doing very well. I can tell you one thing. They are really worried, because Florida, boom, through the roof. Ohio, through the roof, Georgia is looking phenomenal, Texas, I told you, forget it. It’s great. Texas is so good. Iowa’s looking great. They’re all looking good. North Carolina. You know what’s looking really good? Pennsylvania. But get out and vote. Maybe I should say it’s going to be … No, let me take that back. It’s not looking good. It’s very close. It looks like we’re one or two points behind. It’s always good. It’s always good to think you’re about a point or two behind, right? These professionals tell us. Right? I don’t want to tell you we’re doing good. Let’s just say it’s very close. Get out and vote on Tuesday. Just get out and vote. But it’s true. You never know. We are looking good, and I don’t want you to think that. I want you to think it’s going to be close. We’re looking so good. Darling, we don’t have to vote today. It’s looking great. Oh, that’s great. Joe Biden has been a disaster for African Americans and Hispanic Americans. I’m fighting for citizens of every race, color and creed. We achieved record low African American, Hispanic, American, and Asian American unemployment rates, record low unemployment rates for anybody with a diploma, without a diploma. Number one [inaudible 00:34:36] class at MIT, women, everything. We have historic rates, and then we had to close it up and understand the disease. And what they’ve done is incredible, the ventilators, all of the things that we did. And then we’re opening it up now, and it’s going to be a super-V. They were saying, “Oh, it won’t be a V.” Well, now 33.1. It’s called a super-V. We’re going to have the best economic year in the history of our country next year, unless you elect somebody that wants to do a quadrupling of your taxes. I don’t know. I don’t think that’s going to happen. So I signed landmark criminal justice reform, and I announced a platinum plan, which will create three million new jobs for African Americans and also deliver school choice to any parent that wants it, which is so important. They’ve been looking to do that for a long time. To protect our security, I suspended the entry of foreign refugees from terror-afflicted nations, if it’s okay with you. I mean, you don’t mind. We don’t want people from terror-inflicted. Think of this. Biden, in the manifesto, that’s the agreement that he made with crazy Bernie Sanders. Although I shouldn’t say that, because we get a lot of the Sanders people. People don’t realize, four years ago, we got a big percentage of Bernie Sanders, because they agree with me on trade. They know everyone takes advantage of the United States on trade. And we are doing great on trade right now. Biden wants a 700% increase in refugees from the most violent terrorist hotspots on earth, including Syria, Somalia and Yemen. No thanks, Joe. Thank you very much. We appreciate it, Joe. No thank you. The people of Pennsylvania aren’t thrilled with that. Who the hell is going to vote for this guy? They keep saying it’s close. I don’t think it’s close, but get out and vote. It’s close. It’s extremely close. It’ll be extremely close. “Trump wins by 44 points.” No, no it’s close. No, but think of it. He wants to raise your taxes. He wants to let people in from places that you don’t want them. We want to have safety and security. And that’s why when you talk about suburbia. They were saying, women of suburbia …Good. Thank you, darling. Because they want safety, they want security, and they wanted the regulation terminated. You know what? I don’t want to go into it. The regulation is a disaster for suburbia. And you know who’s going to head up the regulation project is Cory Booker of all people, Cory. You too can have a development right alongside of your wonderful house. No, it’s no good, no good, going to bring a lot of problems. It’s already done. I mean, you take a look at throughout the country where it’s been done, and I terminated it. They wanted to amend it. Ben Carson’s a wonderful guy. Ben came in. He says, “Well, we can … ” He’s a wonderful guy. He is. And he ran a good race too. He’s a great guy. He’s a nice guy. And he’s a great guy, and he’s done a terrific job, but he came and he said, “We can amend it a little bit and make it tougher.” I said, “No, Ben, we got to terminate it.” And then I hear the women of suburbia don’t like me. I think they love me. I think they do. And when I said that the other day, I said, “Women of suburbia, I hope you love me.” 60 minutes, she said, “You were begging for the love of women.” I said, “No, I wasn’t. I was having fun.” “But you were begging here.” It’s true. I say women of suburbia, you must love me after what I did. I cut the regulation. You don’t know what the regulation was. I love you too. I love you too. Just get out and vote properly. Just do what’s right. You do what’s right, we’re going to have a big victory. The Biden plan … I mean, this guy had so many years to do all this stuff. All he does is complain, “You didn’t do this.” “Oh, really? Why didn’t you do it. You just left three-and-a-half years ago.” The Biden plan will open the floodgates to radical Islamic terrorism. You know that. Just take a look. I called president Macron of France. It’s terrible what’s been happening over there the last week. You’ve seen what’s been happening. And if you don’t mind, I’d rather not have it happen over here. Is that okay? Do I have everybody’s approval on that? Huh? Even these two veterans are saying, “We agree with that.” And I’m keeping the terrorists out of our country. And when they come back in, we’re getting them the hell out of our country. Okay? We invested 2.5 trillion, with a T, trillion dollars in the US military when I took over four years ago. Can you believe it? Almost four years ago, our military was depleted from all of these Wars and all of this stuff and places so far away and lands that’s so far away, and we were depleted. And a very highly overrated general, you’ve heard me say this, extraordinarily overrated, he came into my office, and he said right at the beginning, “Sir, we have no ammunition.” I said, “No president should ever have that said to him again.” And we built a brand new military, with new planes and new rockets. Hypersonic. That’s seven times faster than our very fast one. So fast, you can’t see it, can’t do anything with it. If it’s aimed in the wrong direction, you got problems, I’ll tell you. And submarines. All of the things we’re doing, we’ve never had anything like it. We are the envy of the world, Russia, China, North Korea. We’re the envy of the world. We have the greatest equipment in the world. We used to have planes, fighter jets. They’d go to the desert, where they have what they call the graveyard, the plane graveyard. And they’d take parts of old planes, and bring them in. ow we have brand new F-35 stealth, super-stealth, many others. It’s amazing. We’ve rebuilt our military. It’s never been so good. Never been. We’ve never had equipment like this, the best equipment anywhere in the world by far. And we saved a place called the Philadelphia shipyard. I don’t think you’ve ever heard of that. And Biden, if he comes in, will shut it down. He’s going to shut it down. He’ll shut down a lot of this stuff. We also passed VA choice and VA accountability. That’s pretty great. Right? They’ve been trying to get that done for 40 some odd years. Last night, at my direction, the United States military conducted a successful operation to rescue at American hostage who was kidnapped just a short while ago. US special forces brilliantly executed a daring nighttime movement. It was incredible. I’ve seen it. It was incredible. And we had no casualties, no injuries. That’s great. No, we had no casualties, no injuries, no nothing incredible. These are incredible people. These are incredible people and they love our country, but they went in and the other side did have a lot of casualties. We got our citizen, our American citizen, out on our way here and it was an incredible operation. People said, “Oh, that can’t be done.” These guys looked at me like, “Sir, this is easy.” It’s a different kind of person, right? Different kind of person. We owe a lot to Special Forces. Over the last four years, we’ve rescued a record 55 hostages and detainees in more than 24 countries, and we don’t pay. We don’t pay. Once you pay, it’ll go up a hundred fold. You can’t pay. You have to go get them. Yesterday’s operation should serve as a stark warning to terrorists and thugs who try and kidnap our people, kidnap our citizens. You cannot escape the long reach of American justice, and that’s what happened. We killed the leader of ISIS, Al-Baghdadi. They’d been looking for him for 18 years. We took out the mass murder of U.S. troops and many other troops and a lot of people. Soleimani is dead. Number one terrorist. I withdrew from the last administration’s disastrous Iran nuclear deal, $150 billion. We got nothing, we got nothing. I recognize the capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. 52 years, they’d been negotiating that. I did it in two hours and it was a good thing. Every president wanted to do this stuff, every president. Jerusalem, they all wanted to do it. They all said they were going to do it. They got into office. They never had the guts to pull the trigger and do it. I got the building bill too, by the way. You know that story. We’ve got to build for a tiny fraction of what people thought it would cost. Tiny fraction, but it’s too long of a story and it’s too cold to be talking about the building. The heck with it, right? Instead of endless wars, we are forging peace in the Middle East. We have already three countries and many more lined up. No more blood in the sand, no more crazy money spent all over the place. No, we did it the opposite way that John Kerry and these people that were not smart. In fact, they were grossly incompetent. You know how I started? I said, “How did Kerry do it?” “This way.” “Okay, whatever he did, do the opposite.” And it worked. We have a lot of them all lined up here to have peace. We could have peace in the Middle East for nothing and no blood. I talked no blood in the sand, there’s blood all over that sand. There’s no blood in the sand. I’m proud to be the first president in decades who has started no new wars. No new wars. But if we ever do start a war, we’ll finish it and we’ll finish it victoriously. We won’t be playing games. A vote for me and the Republican party is a vote to save our beautiful American dream. It’s an American dream and we’ve lost sight of that over a long period of years, if you think. Remember I came out and campaigned? I was up here, I said, “You will say Merry Christmas again.” Right? The department stores. They were saying, “Happy new year, everybody.” The snow and the red and the white, everything perfect. But they didn’t want to say Merry Christmas. I said, “You’re going to say Merry Christmas,” and now they’re all saying Merry Christmas again. We remember the party of the late great Abraham Lincoln, right? The late great Abraham Lincoln. Over the next four years, in conclusion, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we will end our reliance on China once and for all. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. We will defend the right to life, religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms, our second amendment. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency, already signed, January 1st goes into effect. Bigger than healthcare, you watch. Lower drug prices, even more, favored nations clause. We paid for years and years. The most expensive by far in the world. Now we’re going to pay the same as the lowest and the drug companies do not like me too much, I will tell you. They’re not a big fan of your president. They can’t even believe I did it. Favored nations. We pay the lowest price in the world, protect social security and Medicare and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. Always. Always. It’s protected. America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars and NASA is now again the talk of the world. Space center, the talk to the world. It was boarded up, shut up, the runways were … they had grass growing through the cracks. It’s an amazing place. We let very rich people … They like sending up rockets. I said, “Let them set up all the rockets they want. Let them pay for it. We’ll lease them their sights and let them go out and have a lot of fun.” They’ll become a little less wealthy and that’s okay. They don’t mind, but they love sending up rockets and we’re doing things that nobody can even believe, and with Space Force, it’s so necessary so we’re very proud of it. Mike Pence has done a fantastic job on it. Really done a fantastic job. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our school. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. We will live by the timeless words of our national motto, In God We Trust. For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of Pennsylvania, who I know very well. If we win in Pennsylvania, it’s over. You know that, right? Bet I’m freezing up here, I’m freezing. You better get out and vote. “Sir, you lost by just a few votes in Pennsylvania.” I say, “What the hell did I make that trip for?” They said, “We could cancel if you’d like. It’s been a long day.” I started this day very early. I said, “No, I don’t have the courage to tell these people …” Not only did we not, we’re giving you the full treatment. We’re giving you the full treatment. I could have done one of those, “Hey folks, how you doing? Everybody good? Good. I’ll see you later.” Nah, we don’t do that. But you get out there and vote because your country’s at stake. You have the power with your vote to save the American dream for your children, for your grandchildren. But you have to get out and vote. On November 3rd, we must finish the job and drain the swamp. We’ve done a lot of work on it, but it’s deeper and more vicious than anybody thought. It’s more vicious. Look at what’s happening with these big tech companies. Nobody told me this stuff, but you know what? They can’t believe what we’ve done. We have come through situations. It’s amazing. Look at them. They’re sitting in there. They can’t believe … One of the reasons I also came as I wanted them to stand there all night in this freezing wind. But it is an honor. I’ll tell you what. I know this part of the state and I know it and you have just incredible people. There’s no way I would have had the courage to say, “Let’s not do that. We’ll do it some other time.” There’s no way we do that stuff. We don’t do that stuff. We don’t do that stuff, especially to you. For generations America’s destiny was made, forged, and won in places like Johnstown and Pittsburgh, Erie and Altoona, Bethlehem and Montoursville. That’s a nice name. Our American ancestors gave their blood, sweat, and tears to defend our country and our freedom. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, settled a continent, tamed the wilderness, laid down the railroads, raised up those great, beautiful skyscrapers, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America into the single greatest nation in the history of the world, and the best is yet to come. Best is yet to come. I mean that too. The potential we have, unless we blow it by putting people that have no clue in charge. He has no clue. He’s shot. He’s shot. Let’s face it. Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. That’s what’s happening. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We’re going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God, and together with the incredible people of Pennsylvania, we have made America powerful again. Our military, military. We have made America wealthy again. Look at what’s happening with your 401ks. In the midst of a problem, look at those 401ks. Somebody else you would have had nothing. You would have had a piece of paper. You would have been throwing it away and it’s going up a lot. Our headwind is Joe Biden. That’s the only headwind we have to get it up. He’s a headwind, believe it or not. We have a great new name, Joe Headwind. He’s a headwind on the stock market because if he gets in the market will crash. That’s not what the market wants to hear. We’re going to quadruple taxes. We’re going to drive out every company that’s come back into this land. No, he’s a headwind. He really is. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again. We have made America safe again and we will make America great again. Thank you very much, Pennsylvania. Get out and vote. Thank you very much. Thank you.

"103","11-01-20","Wow, what a crowd. What a crowd. Hello, Florida. Hello, Florida. We love Florida. What a great victory we had and we’re going to have an even bigger victory. Get out there and vote. We’re going to have a bigger victory. And I don’t know if you found that you’ve been here a long time. I hope the music was good. I hope life is good. Everything’s good. That’s a good looking crowd. Good looking people, I will say. No, we’re going to have a big victory. I don’t know if you know what’s happening, but they’re very worried, the Democrats about Florida. They’re very concerned. The vote’s not there. It’s not there for them. They had to get out to that big early lead and it could be that we’re leading, that’s a little problem. Two days from now, we’re going to win, my home state of Florida and we are going to win four more years in the White House. It’s a very vital group, isn’t it? With your vote, we will continue to cut your taxes, cut regulations, support our great police, support our great military, protect your Second Amendment, defend religious liberty and ensure more products are proudly stamped with that wonderful phrase, Made in the USA. Next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country. You see what’s happening. You see it happening right before your eyes. Under my leadership, our economy is now growing at the fastest rate ever recorded in the history of our country. 33.1%. 33.1%. We created a record 11.4 million jobs in the last five months alone. Another record, record, record, we got many records. Now we have a chance to do something next year, even greater than last year, we had it the best ever and then we got hit by the plague from China and we will never forget. We’re never going to forget it. And then we’re building it up in a level that nobody thought possible leading every nation in the world by far. While foreign nations are in a free fall, we are creating an economic powerhouse unrivaled anywhere in the world. Nothing and no one in the world is doing what we’re doing. Now, if somebody wants to quadruple your taxes, I can’t tell you what’s going to happen. I think I can. It’s called the depression. A recent Gallup poll found that 56% of Americans say they are better off today than they were four years ago under sleepy Joe Biden and Obama. And if Biden and Kamala, Kamala, Kamala, most liberal member of Congress, she makes crazy Bernie look like he’s a very strict conservative, and the radical left gain power the economy will collapse and our country will go into a very deep and steep depression. I hate to tell you. Look, we’re not going to have to worry about it. If anything we’re going to win. You know who else thinks we’re going to win? The Democrats think we’re going to win, the Democrats. They’re starting to say, “This is not good.” We’re looking great here. We’re looking great in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Iowa. Did you see the poll just came out in Iowa? First big poll? We’re only up eight. I’m very upset about that, we’re only up eight. We’re looking very strong, looking strong in Georgia. We just left the great state of Georgia. We’re looking strong in Georgia. In fact, they said, “Sir, you don’t have to go to Georgia.” They said a couple of days ago, I said, “Wait a minute, people are waiting for two and a half days. I’m not going to cancel on Georgia.” I’ve been doing this since early in the morning, only for you, I guess I could have canceled you too. Right? But nobody would have the courage to cancel you. Nah, I wouldn’t even think about it. Thank you. Thank you. And I love you too. I love you too. We’re all in this together. We’re all in this together. Because as I’ve said many times, this will never ever, ever be a socialist nation. Sleepy Joe Biden will raise your taxes $4 trillion. Can you believe it? He’s the only candidate I’ve ever seen that campaigns on the fact, “I will raise your taxes,” this guy. “I will take away your Second Amendment. We will not frack.” For two years, “We will not have frack,” then he got to Pennsylvania, he said, “Well, I was only kidding.” Look at all the press at this time. At this… Look at that them. The fake news followed us. They followed us. The man, the man. Now, the only one I’ve ever seen do that… We don’t worry about them. They don’t tell the truth anyway so what difference. Just pretend they’re not here. Pretend they’re not here. They’re having a very bad couple of weeks as you know. They’ve actually had a bad four years when you think of it. Massively increase regulations, we cut regulations more than any administration in the history of our country and they’ll put them right back. Sleepy Joe, it won’t be him because he has no idea where he is, but he’s surrounded by a lot of very far left people. Close down your factories, send you jobs overseas, destroy the suburbs. I say, suburban women, please love me, please love me. Got a lot of suburban women, look at this. Wow. Don’t forget suburban women, men also, but we don’t worry about them [inaudible 00:08:17]. I’m terminating a regulation that has ruined suburbia. You too can have a project next to your house and I terminated. Oh, well we have… Is that the first sign of trouble in weeks? All right. Is that okay? Is everybody okay over there? Is that, somebody went down or is it somebody that’s trouble? Because if there’s trouble, we have somebody right over here that can handle it very nicely. I guarantee, I bet everything in this guy right here. You know the one that make all the noises are people, somebody shouts, they have no voice, they’re week. They have no voice. Their mother’s looking for them, their father’s looking for them. They too live in a basement usually. And nobody can hear them. What they hear is thousands of people going to, “You, watch it.” That’s all right. Just pretend the person doesn’t exist or get them out please. They want to terminate your religious liberty, outlaw private healthcare, confiscate your guns, your Second Amendment is under siege. Don’t worry. As long as I’m here, nothing’s happening. They want to ban fracking, abolish energy, cut your Medicare, cut your social security by allowing millions of people to come into our country and indoctrinate your children with anti American lies. That’s where we are but it’s not going to happen. You’re going to vote and it’s not going to happen. You know, we win Florida, we win the whole thing, you know that, right? We win Florida, we win the whole thing. Our opponents want to turn America into communist Cuba or socialist Venezuela and we’re not going to let that happen. Our opponent’s agenda is a war on workers, a war on faith and a war on our police. Biden says he’s running as a proud Democrat. I’m running as a proud American. Is that okay? Joe Biden is a globalist who spent 47 years outsourcing your jobs, opening your borders and sacrificing American blood and treasure in endless foreign wars. They’re all coming back. They’re all coming home, our great soldiers. We became policemen to the world. Well, for other reasons they could very well do that, couldn’t they? Joe Biden is a corrupt politician bought and paid for by China. You see that? And others. In 2016, Florida voted to fire this corrupt political establishment and you elected an outsider as president who is finally putting America first. If I don’t sound like a typical Washington politician, it’s because I’m not a politician. Probably why we won. If I don’t always play by the rules of Washington and the Washington establishment it’s because I was elected to fight for you and I fight harder than anybody in this place, except one person, perhaps him. He’s the only one that fights harder. Great guy. My opponent is promising a long dark winter. Did anybody happen to see the debate? See, that’s my arena. That was my arena. Right? He didn’t come out too good. He came out like your opponents come out. No, that was not good for him. How about the last question? We talked about energy, right? “Well, I’d like to transition out of petroleum.” I felt like Perry Mason. The last question of the evening, I said, “Whoa, did you tell that to Texas? Did you tell that to Pennsylvania?” Even Kristen Welker, who frankly did not a bad job considering she’s totally on the other side of the plate, she looked and she said, “Why did you say that?” She trying to save the poor guy. “This is what we got. Can you believe it. This could only happen to me.” I don’t care. I’ll say it anyway. Look, this is in the history of presidential politics, this is the worst candidate ever to run. This puts a lot of pressure on me because if you lose to a guy like this, I’d rather really have a great candidate because you feel better. I’m running against the worst candidate in the history of presidential politics. Is there any place you would rather be than at a Trump rally? Got a lot of rich people here. My friend. You got a lot of… Oh, Steve. Hi Steve. We got a lot of rich people, a lot of money, a lot of money in this first row. A lot of money. I built the best economy in history, and now we’re going to do it again. You know that hat. I see thousands and thousands of them. We’re getting 35, 40,000 people all the time. We’d get more, but they don’t have any more room. How about this? You take an airport, right? You take an airport, you don’t have enough room. Did you ever think of that one? We have an airport. We don’t have enough room. This is amazing. There’s never been anything like this has ever happened in the history of politics. Probably on any other history and I don’t have a guitar. You know the truth is… No, it’s true. They don’t get crowds like this. Nobody gets crowds like this. You know what gets crowds like this? Making America Great Again. That’s what it does. It’s the only thing that’s going to get a crows like this. Sleepy Joe had a rally today, they had 12 people in those little circles. It’s got those little crazy circles. It’s the only thing good about his campaign, the guy that does the work, I’m a perfectionist, they’re so beautiful, nice and wide. And they can’t fill them up so they get the media, “Could you please take a circle?” So they get the media. Could you please take a circle? And now he’s got President Barack Hussein Obama comes in. President Obama. You know, the Democrats never talk about it. You know that federal judgeships are like the biggest deal, and then you have Supreme Court justices. Barack Obama left me 142 federal judges. Nothing like that’s ever happened, nothing. Very rarely does it … You know, when you’re a president, every one … You leave; every one of them is filled. Those are the most important things you can have. Federal judgeships, lifetime appointments. It’s such a big deal. He left me 142, and we are going to have … Listen to this. We are going to have, in my first term, record-breaking, approximately 300 federal judges. It’s a very big percentage of the whole federal bench. And we are going to have … We just put a great one on: Amy. Three Supreme court justices. And whatever happened with Biden? He was going to say … Is he going to pack the court? He just keeps tapping. Maybe he’s smarter than we think. Keeps tapping it along. And who are the people he’s going to put on? He was supposed to say who he’s … You cannot vote for him if he doesn’t tell you about packing the court. Therefore is anybody in this audience going to vote for Sleepy Joe Biden? I can’t imagine anyone having the courage. I can’t believe it. Look at those people. They go … Does anybody have the courage to even raise your hand? That wouldn’t be a very good thing to do. Who is going to vote on election day for President Trump? Who has already voted? Has anybody here … Seriously, we don’t mind. Not going to matter. Not going to matter. Has anybody voted? With all those people that have already voted, we have a lot of votes going out, and I think we’re leading. Can you believe? In early voting. Has any … Oh, that’s a shock. Oh, that’s the big story. They’re saying we have to get more people out. We have … Maybe I shouldn’t say that. People are watching. No, we’re doing good. No, but anybody here vote for Sleepy Joe Biden? Okay, good. I believe you. I believe you. This election is a choice between a crippling depression or a historic boom. It is. You have a depression. All that money, all those 401Ks, they’re got to go right down the tubes. Throw it out. It’s a choice between a deadly Biden lockdown. He wants to lock down the country. I just left the country … I just left a state that locked down. I left two of them, and they’re not happy about it. I’ll tell you right now. You know what’s going to happen to them? On November 4th, the day after, they’re going to say, “All right, we’ll open up now.” That’s why they’re locking down. But we’re going to have a safe vaccine that ends the pandemic. Without it, it’s rounding the … I say it. It drives them crazy. It’s rounding the turn, because all they want to do … You turn on the news: COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID. We’d like to talk about COVID, and then the next time, here’s what happens. November 4th, you won’t hear too much about it. You won’t hear too much about it. Don’t tell anybody, but let me wait till a little bit after the election. I appreciate the advice. I appreciate it. No, he’s been wrong on a lot. He’s a nice man, though. He’s been wrong on a lot. “Do not, under any circumstances, wear a mask,” he said. “Do not close up to China,” he said. Then he said later on that President Trump saved tens of thousands of lives because I closed early. But how about this? How about Sleepy Joe? I close and he calls me xenophobic. I said, “Give me a definition of that, Joe. Give me a definition.” He didn’t know how. He had no idea what it meant. You know, 25 years ago, he was not smart. He was never considered smart, and now he’s considered about half of that. This is not what you want for your president. We’re doing too well. Our country’s doing too well. We will mass-distribute the vaccine in just a few weeks. We have all the vaccines. It’s all set. Our military is going to deliver. They’re going to take care of our seniors first. Is it okay if we take care of our seniors first? You know, I got it. I knew you didn’t hear this story, but I got it, because I got better quickly, but I got it. The First Lady got it, and a very young, tall person, 14 years old, named Barron Trump, got it. And I got better. They gave me something called Regeneron, but I’m sure I didn’t need it, because I am a perfect physical specimen and I’m very young. I’m very young. Perfect physical specimen. You know, I said that a little sarcastically, and I said … Although I actually think I am. No, I’m only kidding. No, I said that sarcastically. CNN, right over there with the red light, just went off. Any time I mention them, that light goes off. We have to cut to a commercial. You know, in one way, they need the ratings because they don’t get good ratings. No, they hated it when I said it. They said, “He is not a perfect physical specimen. It’s a disgrace. He’s lying to the American public, and he is not young. He is not young.” They went crazy. They went totally crazy. They went crazy. They spent two days on that one. Joe Biden, well, he’s very threatening all the time. He’s so agitated. Did you see him today with the glasses, the whole deal? But you don’t see the bad surgery. I put on those … What do they call them? Aviators? But they’re too small. They got to be bigger, right? They’re mirrored. You don’t see anything going through it. No, he’s very agitated, so angry. Everything’s screaming and shouting. It’s like crazy. But he’s a weak person. You know, he challenged me. Do you remember? A year-and-a-half ago? “Oh, I’d like to take him behind the barn.” And I said, “You know … ” I said, “Of all the people in the world that I could fight, that’s probably the one I’d like to most fight.” Those legs have gotten very thin, not a lot of base. You wouldn’t have to close the fist. And by the way, he brings it up. You know, when he brings it up, the press says nothing. If I ever said, “I’d like to take him behind the barn and beat the crap out of him,” you know what? They would say, “Our president is inciting evil.” I’m inciting. Every time you shout, “Lock him up,” or every time … Did you see the cars today? All over the place. Cars, trucks, and boats, all organic. They just formed, 5,000 boats. They have tractors in Iowa, thousands and thousands of tractors in this massive farm. They came from all over farm country. They had the thing with these … Really, I’d say very good people. They were riding along the highway, and you had Sleepy Joe’s bus. So they escorted the bus, and the radical left said, “Oh, what a horrible thing that is to escort the bus.” They don’t tell you about Antifa that go around burning down your cities. Democrat-run, only Democrat-run. They don’t talk about that, bopping people over the head, killing people, setting everything on fire. They don’t tell you about that. They tell you about people that are driving down a highway with an American flag and a Trump flag. Don’t worry; they’ll be just fine. They are going to be just fine. If they’re watching, I guess they were in Texas, right? Oh, Texas will be just fine. We’re doing great in Texas, by the way, really good. You know how? Is this the greatest? You know, I’ve had really six of these, because I had them here, but let’s say five, okay? Do you know what it is to do five of these? I start early in the morning. No, think of it. Start early in the morning, but you know what’s the nice part about this one? This is the last one of the day, so we can stay all night. All night. I was rushing. I was rushing. They said, “You’re going to be late for Florida, Sir.” I said, “How much?” “About an hour-and-a-half.” “Oh, that’s not so bad.” I hope everyone’s having… You know how many people we lost? I’d say zero. We actually gained. People heard about it. They said, “Let’s go.” No, it’s great to be with you. It’s great. Tomorrow, I have five more. Can you imagine five? Five. Five more, and then normally, they’d say, “Five more and let’s crash,” but I don’t know if I can crash. I think it’s going to be a very exciting day. Tuesday is going to be a very exciting day. Make sure you get out. Tuesday is going to be a very exciting day. The most exciting day in the history of television was four years ago, right? Thank you. No, but it is nice that we can take our time. I can tell you stories about some of the things that happen in government. You don’t want to hear them. You wouldn’t even believe them, the level of stupidity, the things that we saved. Like we saved a couple of billion dollars on the embassy in Israel. We built it for slightly less. We built it for slightly less. First, I picked the site that we already owned. You know, that’s better than paying millions for a site, but I picked one that was a better location, bigger, better. Then they were going to build the building for anywhere between one billion and two. This is like a two-storey building, right? One billion and 2 billion, and we built it for $500,000, a slight saving. We had an existing building that we fixed up. We used Jerusalem stone, very expensive when you bring it to New York or Washington. But when you’re building in Jerusalem, it’s a very cheap material. I said, “Use Jerusalem stone. It’s great stuff.” And we opened it for $500,000, instead of two billion dollars. That’s one of many. We could tell you about them all night, but let’s get back to the point. Isn’t it nice when you have a president that doesn’t need a teleprompter? You have a president … It is a nice thing. I had a couple today, though. It was so windy. It was so unbelievable windy, you wouldn’t have believed that the teleprompters were going like this. And then I finally gave up on the teleprompter, so we just talked for an hour and 20 minutes. I said, “This is not possible to read those things, going, “Wah.” You know, the winds were like 30 to 40. The press knows. They couldn’t hold onto the camera. That was a positive event. They know. They never saw. It was probably minus something, if you talk about wind chill. I think it was 30 degrees with a 30-mile-an-hour wind, and it was blowing right in my face. These people that set this up … It was blowing so hard, and I had a whole section on illegal immigrants pouring into our country, and I left it out, because I said, “If they would have had to suffer the cold weather that I was, they would never come in. They would have stayed. They would have stayed right where they came from.” They had some rough … We had three. The first three were freezing. So I go from freezing, and today was like 98 degrees. I said, “How warm is it?” “Sir, it’s about 97 degrees.” This is wonderful for not catching pneumonia. Biden’s cruel lockdown would be especially devastating for Florida’s tourism and hospitality workers, for the services industry, and for millions of Latinos in Florida, Arizona, and Nevada, and all across the country. If you want a vaccine to kill the virus, a job to support your family, and freedom to live your life, then you have no choice but to cast your vote for a person named President Trump. It’s very true. But I don’t have to talk too much about Sleepy Joe, because I spent a fortune today to give you a beautiful … Look at the size of that screen that we put up. Where do you have two? You have two of them. This must be Florida. Look at that. You have two of them. Take a look. Here’s a video. Roll it. Thank you. I don’t even have to say … I could say, goodnight, everybody. That can not be your president. The Biden lockdown would cripple Florida. My plan will lift Florida to record highs, we’ve already been doing it. So joining us tonight, we have some wonderful people. You have a wonderful, great governor, loves your state and loves our country. Governor Ron DeSantis, Ron? A man who’s become a really good friend of mine. We went to war and he’s a tough guy, he’s a smart guy. But he really he’s doing a fantastic job for you and for everybody, Senator Marco Rubio. Good to see you, Marco. You have great senators. This is one that happened to be your governor also. And Ron would be the first one to say it, Rick Scott did a great job as governor doing a great job as your Senator, Rick Scott. Where is Rick? Thank you, Rick. And a great job on television today, Jeanette Nunez. Thank you very much, Jeanette. Wow, what a good job you did. What a job you did representing your state and said nice things about a lot of people. The only one I really cared about was me. So I was very happy. It did a great job today. Thank you very much, Jeanette. Chief financial officer, Jimmy Patronis Jimmy. Thank you. Thank you, Jimmy. Great. Doing great, Jimmy. And we have some warriors with us, real warriors, Mario Diaz Balart, Congressman. Thank you Mario. Fantastic job. Fantastic job. He’s become a friend of mine. He had the China plague and he got better pretty quick, right? Got better quick. And now he’s immune. Until I came along, they said, “If you’re immune you’re immune for life, everybody’s immune.” When I got it, I said I was immune. They said, “Yeah, but it’s only for four months now.” Mario, they only now give us four months, okay? What a terrible thing. I’m sorry I did that to all of those people. And another warrior, tough guy, smart guy. And really my friend, Brian Mast. Thank you, Brian. Congressional candidates, they’re fantastic. Byron Donalds. Where is Byron? You are doing great, Byron. You are doing great. Good job. Fantastic job. And another man, I’ve known him for a long time, he’s terrific. He’s going to win he’s up in the polls by the way, Carlos Jiminez. Where is he? Carlos. Thank you, Carlos. Good job. And the next mayor of Miami Dade County, Steve Bovo. Hey, you’re a popular guy, Steve. You’re a popular guy. Former attorney general and a fantastic talent and my friend for a long time. Oh, we’re going to look for something for her. She had to go out and make a couple of bucks and I’m sure she’s doing great. She’s always done great, and she was an incredible representative of your state, a very special woman, Pam Bondi. Pam, great. You’re doing a great job. Great person. Another great person. She was so tough in California. She was the DA, right? The DA. And she was brutal. I think she’s like 471 to nothing. You never wanted to get in trouble with this one. And she’s a very special person to me and to my family. Kimberly Guilfoyle And I have respect for champions. There’s a reason you’re a champion. And whether it’s Jack Nicklaus, who gave us a beautiful endorsement the other day. So many champions, right? Actually, not too many champions. Usually they tend to choke in the end. In the end, they’re not champions, but we have one of the greatest fighters anywhere in the world. In fact, I was willing before, when there was a little trouble back there, I was willing to pit whoever that poor person was against the greatest fighter, Jorge Masvidal. The greatest. I went to a UFC fight. I went to a UFC fight and this gentleman, and he is a gentleman. Great guy, actually, hard to believe. How the hell are you such a nice guy? I have a feeling I don’t know. He was fighting a young superstar, right? He was a young, handsome guy. Really good looking guy. Maybe that was the problem with him, he looked too good. And I was Dana White, the great Dana White. You know who Dana White is, what a job. And he said, “Let me tell you something, Jorge has been around for a little while.” He’s won most of his fights. I hear he’s got a very big one coming up. I’ll be watching that one. I’m going to be watching it, he’s a fantastic talent. He fought as a very young guy. Used to fight at eight years old, had beat up people that are 16 and 17. And then one day they said, “Let’s take this guy to the gym.” And you know what? He beat up all these guys in the gym. And he’s a total champion. He’s a total champion, and I do want to take that bet. Is that person still here? No, he went back home to mom? Went back home to mom. But we had this young, handsome, really, he looked like a male model. And Dana white said to me, “This is the future of the UFC. Watch how great he is. He’s tremendous.” And wasn’t he like 12 and 0, and he walked in the ring and he was full of stuff. And this guy walks in and the fight lasted. What was it? One and a half seconds, I think. Five seconds. It was the quickest knockout in the history of the UFC. No, it was like, ding. He runs across the ring, kicks the hell out of him, right in the face. And I looked at Dana. I said, “Dana, what happened? What happened?” He’s a great fighter. And he’s a great guy. Thank you very much. Thank you for being here. Champ, he’s a champ. He’s got that heart. He’s got that heart. Thank you, man. We need more people like him, I can tell you. We need people like him in our government that have guts and courage and smarts too. For decades, our politicians spent trillions of dollars, rebuilding foreign nations, fighting ridiculous foreign wars and defending our foreign borders that we didn’t defend our own borders. But now we do. And now we’re finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities and we are bringing our jobs, our factories, and our troops back home to the USA where they belong. It’s enough. For 47 years. Sleepy, Joe Biden, betrayed Hispanic Americans. I’m not going to let you meet him, champ, you may get angry. That’d be one 10th of one second. Now he wants to close your small businesses, eliminate school choice and attack our Hispanic law enforcement heroes at the border, you know that. The radical left will assault Catholic organizations, ban prayer in school and fund extreme late term abortion. I will always stand with the incredible Hispanic American community, you know that. Well, that’s one of the things that’s going wrong with the vote. I’ll tell you. You’ve been here so long that some of you have been here since like yesterday. I know you’ve been on line. But you’ve been here a long time, but I’ll tell you, so one of the problems with Florida for the other side for sleepy, Joe and the Democrats is that they say, “What happened? The Hispanic Americans are not voting. They’re not coming out for sleepy Joe?” Who the hell can vote for this guy? They’re saying that’s one, right? The other one is the black community. What’s going on? They’re voting for Trump. They’re voting for Trump. Look at you. They’re voting for Trump. They’re voting for Trump. Did you see it, 18%? The old days, they’d get 4%. You want 4%, you needed 4%. 18 or 19%, I think it’s going up to 20%, whatever it is, it’s about three times what anyone’s gotten. Thank you very much. Thank you to the black community. Thank you to the Hispanic community. And we’re returning the pharmaceutical industry back to Puerto Rico. Biden is the one that took it out. So I don’t know if we have anybody from Puerto Rico. Do we have Puerto Rico? Puerto Rico? Yes. We’re bringing those jobs back. That was Biden. Oh, that’s right. Oh yes. We’re bringing the pharmaceutical industry back. It was doing great and then Biden and his group of clowns, they didn’t know what the hell they were doing. They moved it. You know where it moved to? China. We’re bringing it all back. Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure Southern border in the history of the United States. And the wall right now, it’s over 400 miles. It’ll be finished very shortly. And it’s everything that the border patrol, I listened to them. They wanted steel, concrete, and rebar. I said, “What about just concrete plank?” “Sir, we want it this way.” I said, “Okay, I’ll do it.” I don’t want to give them any excuses. But it’s incredible what’s happened with that and we have the most secure border we’ve ever had. And by the way, we want people to come into our country, but we want them to come in on merit and we want them to come in legally and that’s what happens. That’s what we’re doing. We want them to come in. We need people to come in because of the jobs, we need people. The Biden Kamala plan. How about when she introduced herself? And they said the Harris, the Harris-Biden administration, and then Joe Biden said the same thing two hours later. He said, “Under the Harris-Biden administration.” This is twice in one day. I love Mike Pence. I think he’s great, don’t we? But I have a deal with Mike. I said, “Mike, I will never say it’s the Pence-Trump administration.” But Mike has done a great job. He’s done a great job. He’s done a great job with NASA. NASA, the space center, we have done a great job with that. Mike has led it. The Biden- Harris plan would increase refugees from terrorist regions by a staggering 700%, including from Syria, Somalia, and Yemen. And I am keeping radical Islamic terrorists out of our country, if you don’t mind. We’re keeping them the hell out. If you don’t mind, if Florida doesn’t mind, we will. I put a ban on, everyone told me what a horrible thing to do. Ask France, whether or not that would be a good thing for them. Have you seen what’s happened in France over the last week? No, thank you. We want people to come into our country who love our country. For instance, we’re going to win Minnesota. You know one of the reasons why? Ilhan Omar, She loves our country very much. She loves our country. It’s unbelievable. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. She loves us very much. We invested $2.5 trillion in the US military, the most ever. And you know what? I said, we got to break the budget for this one, because all built in the USA. We have the best missiles, the best rockets, the best fighter jets, have 35, submarines, nobody even close to us, we have submarine technology that nobody’s even close. We have things that nobody, we are the envy of the world militarily. And when I took it over, it was a depleted, broken military. One of the most overrated generals anywhere in the history of this country came up to me and said, sir, we have no ammunition. This was my first week in office. I was getting a little bit frisky with a certain country. You know that right? You all know about it. And he came and he said, sir, we have no ammunition. I became much less frisky with that contract. I said, it will have to wait. Now we have so much ammunition, we don’t know what the hell to do with it, okay. We also passed VA choice and VA accountability for our great vets. Right? Right? Yeah. They said it couldn’t be done. Just got a 91% approval rating from our vets, the highest by far that we’ve ever had. At my direction, the United States military conducted a successful operation to rescue an American hostage kidnapped overseas just 96 hours ago. Last night… He was kidnapped 96 hours ago, we went in last night, the US special forces, brilliantly executed a daring, nighttime operation. [inaudible 00:49:56] They wanted to do it so badly. They kidnap this young, in a far away land. They kidnap this young American, kidnapped him and they were negotiating for a, they wanted money. Once you give money, once you do that, you’ll have it hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times. So we had some people that are the best in the world. These are the best fighters in the world, except for him, maybe. I don’t know, different kind of fighting, right? Different, different kind of fighting right? But these are the best in the world. Incredible people, smart, brilliant in so many ways, and great. They wanted to do it. I said, do they want to do it? You couldn’t hold them back. And they went in there and they went in by night and it was over very quickly. And we didn’t have anybody even injured slightly. We got the hostage and unfortunately they are gone. They are gone. Now, if you pay them, they’ll be doing just over and over. So I’d like, it would be wonderful, let’s say, but once you do that, even if it was a small amount, it’s no good. And they didn’t want a small amount. They wanted a lot of money. Over the last four years, we’ve rescued a record 55 hostages and detainees in more than 24 countries. And some of them were very tough countries, but we were able to get them out. That’s a lot. That’s a record too. And what do we have? Robert O’Brien, is he around here? He’s fantastic. Where’s Robert? Where is Robert? He is so good. What happened to him? He’s out negotiating a hostage deal. That’s all he does. Where is Robert? Where is Robert? Robert, look at him. I’ll tell you. He’s a little, he’s a little tired. This is his fifth rally today too. He’s fantastic. He’s fantastic. What a job he does. Thank you, Robert. Great job too. Congratulations. That was brave. I said, Robert, do you want to do it? It was like, yes before I finished the question. You want to do it, Robert? Yes. So anyway, good job. Thank you very much. The operation should serve as a stark warning to terrorists and thugs who try to kidnap our people. You cannot escape the long reach of our American military or American justice. You can’t do it. We obliterated 100% of the ISIS caliphate and it was a mess. Let me tell you, when I took over, it was a mess. It was all over the place. It’s gone, 100%. We killed the leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi. They were looking for him for 14, first day in office, I said to our people, great people. I said, where’s al-Baghdadi? That’s all I heard about, al-Bag, every time I’d say where’s al-Baghdadi. And one day they came in, they said, we have him, sir, what do you want us to do? I said, I’ll tell you what, let’s go. And we got a bad, bad guy, founded ISIS. And he was trying to rebuild it again. We eliminated the mass murderer of us troops, and many troops and many people. Soleimani is dead. I withdrew from the last administration’s disastrous Iran nuclear deal. Iran is not doing well. They had a 27% GDP decline. It was like the opposite with all the sanctions. I’ll tell you the first call I get, if we win, we got to win. First call I get will be from the Supreme Leader, as he calls himself, the Supreme Leader. I refuse to call him the Supreme Leader, but he calls himself the Supreme Leader. The first call will be from the Supreme Leader. And you know what? I’d love to make a deal with him. You know why? We don’t want to do anything bad, but we just can’t let them have a nuclear weapon, if that’s okay. Can’t let them have. Obama paid him $150 billion, 150 billion, 150 million would be a lot, but 150 billion. It’s not even, it’s not even conceived. This is people that don’t have any clue about life. Gave him 1.8 billion in cash, in green. Can you believe it? Cash. Five plane loads, big planes. Exactly, where is that beautiful plane that we came in? Where the hell is it? Oops. Somebody stole Air Force One. Planes like that. I recognized the capital of Israel and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. 52 years, they’ve been negotiating. People would fly in, fly out, fly in, fly out, have dinner, have lunch, fly in, fly out. 52 years. I did it in two hours, a little bit less. And instead of endless war, we are now forging peace in the Middle East. We have the countries aligned, [inaudible 00:07:18]. No blood in the sand, no costs, no nothing. They want, you know what? After all these years, frankly, we just said, what did Obama do? And I heard, and you know what I did? I did the opposite. I said, what did Obama do? And then I did the opposite, and it worked. Biden and Barack Hussein Obama made a pathetic one-sided deal with the Castro regime on Cuba. That was the other thing I did. I said, who made the deal? Obama. I said, we’re going to go the exact opposite way. Okay. We only have a 96% approval rating with Cuban Americans, 96. 96%. Who the hell are the 4%? Champ, who are the 4%? Now the Biden campaign has said that they will work closely with socialistic dictator Maduro in Venezuela. Not the way you do it. My opponent embraces socialists and communists because he has no choice, because that’s who he’s dealing with in government. I stand with the proud people of Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, in their righteous struggle for freedom. And we’re making a lot of progress. A vote for me is, we are making, by the way, we’re making a lot of progress. A vote for me in the Republican party is a vote for the American dream. That’s what it is. So in conclusion, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we will end our reliance on China once and for all, it’s already started. We will expand opportunity zones, increase vocational education, and provide school choice to every family in America. We will hire more police. Increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement. And we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. With God’s help, we will defend the right to life, religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms. Your second amendment. [inaudible 00:58:08]. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. That’s what we’re doing. We will end surprise medical billing. Require price transparency, lower drug prices to the lowest levels they’ve ever gone. And we will always protect patients with pre existing condition. America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars very soon. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, in God we trust. For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great, incredible, wonderful people of Florida. You better vote, vote, vote, vote. Two days from now, America’s fate is in your hands. And as I said, we win Florida. We win it all. Your vote can defeat the Washington swamp. We’ve done a good job of it, but it’s deeper and more vicious than we ever thought. And the corrupt media right there, once and for all. So you must get out and vote. We have never had in the history of our country, I really believe this, a more important election. We will never, ever be, [inaudible 01:00:19] wants to start a conversation with me. Can you believe? That’s okay, darling. Yes? Oh, good. Joan Miller from the Brooklyn Club. Hi, Joan. Joan, let me finish up. Joan, thank you very much. From Tampa to Tallahassee, from Orlando to Jacksonville, and from Pensacola to Miami, we inherit the legacy of American Patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears to defend our country and our freedom. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, laid down the railroads, raised up the great skyscrapers, won two world Wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America into the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And the best is yet to come. Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion, your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of Florida, we have made America powerful again, our military. We have made America wealthy again, wealthy, wealthy, wealthy. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again. We have made America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, Florida. Go out and vote. Thank you.

"104","11-02-20","Thank you very much Grand Rapids, you know, this is … This was our final night prior to a very, very big victory, that was it. Remember? We left at around 1:00 in the morning. I got home, my wife said, now First Lady, said, “You have to be kidding.” We came home late and then we watched the beautiful victory, and we’re going to have another beautiful victory tomorrow. And we’re going to win the state of … You know what we’re going to win, we’re going to win the state so easily. We’re going to win the state of Michigan so easily. We want to do it just like last time. But let’s give me a little bit more margin than that if you don’t mind. So we’re going to win the state of Michigan and we are going to win four more years in that very beautiful, beautiful, beautiful house. It’s called the White House. We made history together four years ago, and tomorrow we’re going to make history once again. So this has been really, this was amazing, Grand Rapids, I’ll never forget it though. We were called, late in the evening, Ronna, thank you very much, wherever you may be. She kept calling, say, “One more trip, one more trip to Michigan, I’m telling you, one more trip.” And then we heard crooked Hillary was coming back because they were hearing … Oh, you know, Michigan hadn’t been won for a long time, many, many years by a Republican. We heard that Barack Hussein Obama and Hillary, Bill, and Bill was the only one that got it right. Said, “You don’t want to run against Trump,” he said that very early. He was the only one, he’s the only one that understood what was going on actually. But they came and they came and they wanted to be in Michigan, which was unscheduled. So I got a call from Ronna, the whole group, and they said, “Could you go back?” We got here at 12:00 in the evening, I started speaking at 12:30, now election day, I’ll never forget it. We had 32,000 people, almost as many as we have tonight. And I said to my team, “We have to … This is it.” We’ve done five, but actually six, because we ended up last night around 2:00 in the morning in Miami, so we can say that includes this … So that would be six. We’ve done six of these big, and every one was just a lot of people. And you know what? There was a lot of love. There was a lot of love. We had a lot of love. We had 45,000 people in Florida last night. By the way, we’re doing very well in Florida. We’re doing very, very well in Wisconsin. We’re doing very well in Texas, I hear great things about Texas. You know they’re saying Texas may be even … Well, you know, then you think sleepy Joe Biden’s against guns. That’s not good for Texas, right? He’s against oil. Oil isn’t good. If you’re against oil, that’s not good politics, right Texas? And he’s against god. Right? When you have guns, oil, and god, and he’s doing well in Texas, I don’t think so. But I actually know for a fact we’re doing very well in Texas. I think we’re doing very well all over. I think you’re going to have, I don’t know if it’s as much of a … I don’t know what’s a surprise. We fulfilled everything we said we were going to fulfill, and that’s why people are And we did some things that we never even talked about, right? We never talked about Space Force. We got it. And I said you know what? I looked at Russia, I looked at China, and I said, “We need Space Force.” And we did it, first time in 74 years, not since the Air Force. But I want to thank you all. We have a great group of people here. I’d like to show our appreciation for our phenomenal vice president, Mike Pence, and his amazing wife Karen. Did he make a good speech? I saw him on the plane and I couldn’t sort of … Did he make a good speech? Huh? He’s great, I’ll tell you what. It was close, it was close. If I had my choice between Mike and Kamala, I think it’s a very close choice, but I think I’ll take Mike. I think we’ll stick with Mike and Karen. No. By the way, how badly did he beat her in that debate? Did you ever hear the expression, if that were a fight they would have stopped it. But anyway. No, Mike’s been great from day one, and I appreciate it. I also want to thank Don, Jr., Eric, Ivanka, Tiffany. Words cannot express how proud you make me every single day. No matter what happens tomorrow, I’m very proud of you all. But if we don’t win I’ll never speak to them again. They like him. They like them all. No no. I’m very proud. We’re very proud of you. Thank you. Look at these people. There’s a lot of spirit here. A lot of spirit. No, it’s funny though, I kept saying we have to finish off here. We have to do it. It’s just we could be a little bit superstitious, right? But you people, you’ve been great, you’ve been great. And I think we’re going to have a tremendous victory in Michigan. Don’t forget, four years ago I said, “Why are so many car companies leaving?” You know, you were losing everything to Mexico and to China and to frankly Canada, and you were losing everything. And we stopped it, and now you have many, many car plants that have already been built, are being built, renovations, 17 … You didn’t have a deal in like 42 years. It was always going out. Now they’re all coming in. I want to thank Prime Minister Abe of Japan. I said, “Shinzo, Shinzo, you got to do me a favor, Shinzo. You got to build some plants.” And he said, “No, no, no, we are the government, we don’t do that. That’s up to the private sector.” I said, “No, Shinzo, you got to do it. You got to do it. It’s not fair. You’re sending too many cars and they’re built in Japan. We wanted them built in Michigan, we wanted them built in Ohio, we want them built in South Carolina and North Carolina. We got to do it.” He says, “But I do not do that, Donald.” And the next day they announced five companies are coming to Michigan. But he’s a great guy. And he retired. He had some difficulty with his health, but he was a great prime minister of Japan, and he did a great favor to Michigan and to us, all of us, he’s a … We have a lot of activity in Michigan. It would be nice if your governor would open up the state, however. Would open up the state. Open up your schools, open up the state, go back. Get back to business. The only one that’s allowed to roam free is her husband. What’s her husband like? Remember? That wasn’t so long ago. He’s allowed to do whatever he wants. But everybody else, you’re not allowed to leave your house or your apartment. No, she’s got to open it up. Well they will. On November 4th, she’ll announce, “Okay, now we’re going to open.” You know, they’re doing that for political … They think it hurts us in the election. Actually it helps us, okay? Who has voted so far? Has anyone voted? Okay, good. Because you’re saving it, right? You’re saving it for Tuesday? Right? No, we’re cool. We’re going to have a red wave, they call it the great red wave like nobody’s ever seen before. Like nobody’s ever seen. So based on just early results though, Florida looks like it’s phenomenal. Just phenomenal. North Carolina’s looking great. I think they’re all looking great. Ohio is looking fantastic. You know, we won Ohio last time by eight points, and I said, “Well why are …” These fake polls that they put out, they’re called suppression polls. If they make them bad enough, they hope you don’t want to waste your time and vote, right? We love our president, but if he’s losing by 250 points, let’s stay home and have dinner, darling. It doesn’t work, because you people don’t, you don’t go for the bait do you? It’s really amazing. And I think we’re winning. I think we’re going to win everything. I think tomorrow’s going to be-one of the greatest wins in the history of politics. I want to give the very special thank you also to Jared Kushner, who is in the process of negotiating a little thing called peace in the Middle East. Great guy. Great guy. They like that. They like the sound. Peace in the Middle East without blood all over the sand, no blood in the sand, and no cost, just peace. Already three countries, UAE, a great leader, Mohammed, great leader. And three countries have already signed. Bahrain. It’s already signed. Sudan. And we have many, many countries, how many do we have lined up? It’ll be more than 10. Now what would happen if sleepy Joe Biden had to take over the deal? You know what happens? That’s the end of that deal. You can forget that deal. The sleepy one. Lara Trump, thank you Lara, what a job you do. What a job you do. You know, Lara’s a specialist on a place called North Carolina, I will tell you. She lived there and she grew up there and they love her there, and Pennsylvania, that extends to Pennsylvania next door, and you said that we’re doing phenomenally there, right? So I think that’s right. She said win. I think they’re both wins, big wins. We got to be careful though, because the Pennsylvania deal with that decision, oh, you can count the ballots later on, and count them whenever you’d like. No. No. We have to be very, very careful with that, that causes a lot of problems. I want to thank Kimberly Guilfoyle. Kimberly is fantastic, from day one. I’d watch her on The Five, and she always liked me, right from the beginning, so I always liked her. If they don’t like me, I never like them. It’s funny the way that works. But she was their big star, and she did great, and thank you very much Kimberly, I appreciate it very much. And Tiffany, thank you for the job you do. She goes around from place to place. She just graduated from law school. She just graduated from Georgetown. She did a great job. Thank you, honey, thank you very much. And Michael, thank you very much. Thank you very much. To all of our supporters here tonight, I really want to thank you from the bottom of our hearts. We’ve worked very hard in four years. We’ve been hit by fake, fake investigations, fake scandals, fake impeachments. We’ve had so many things that, the witch hunt, I call it the witch hunt. And it turned out to be a phony witch hunt, and they should have known it the first day. They did know it the first day. But it’s the deep state, it’s whatever you want to call it, but it should have never happened. Think of it. They spied on our campaign. They got caught. They tried to take down a duly elected president of the United States. They got caught. And you know who knew all about it? Barack Hussein Obama and sleepy Joe Biden. They knew all about it. They knew all about it. And then I watch the fake news back there, look at all of them. Look at all of the fake news, isn’t that nice. It’s a lot of fake news. Then I watch the fake news saying, “You know, his attitude is a very tough attitude. He’s not very nice, he’s a very nasty person.” No no. We’re defending ourselves, and we’re defending all of these people that voted for us. With these fake …And then what happens? It turns out to be that it was them that were guilty of all of these horrible crimes. Including the crime of treason, because when you try and take down a duly elected president, you know, it’s called treason, it’s called big stuff. It’s big stuff. So we’re going to see how that all works out. We’re going to see how that. But that’s another reason we want to go for a long time, frankly. Because you know what? We started something incredible. We built the greatest economy in the history of the world. We then had to close it down for a period of time. We saved millions of lives. Remember the original estimate was 2.2 million people would die from the China plague, and they could have kept it in China. They didn’t get infected in the rest of China after Wuhan Province. But it came out to the world, it came out to Europe and the United States and 188 countries all over the world. And we can never forget that. We signed a great trade deal with China, but it doesn’t mean so … The ink wasn’t dry, and all of a sudden this happened. But the job we’ve done, when you see the numbers, and you’re going to hear the numbers because they’re coming out very soon, the job we’ve done has been an incredible job. We had to close it up. We saved millions of lives. We now opened it up. You saw what happened. 33.1%. The fastest in the history of our country. The fastest growth, the biggest growth in the history of our country. But you’ve been there right from the beginning, we’ve all been together, and I’ll tell you what, we very much appreciate it. And think of how it could have been different, except I think in a way we would have been less popular. Somebody said, because they would have said just another presidency. This time, you know we had to fight for you. We had to fight. You understood it. You understood the hoax better than anybody. It was a hoax. The Russian hoax. And after spending $48 million, 18 angry Democrats, and smart people, vicious, they were vicious, they were smart. If they could find any little morsel. And they went over taxes. And they went over everything you can go over. They spent $48 million, two and a half years. The Mueller investigation scam. And they come up, no collusion, there’s no collusion after all of that. Which makes me perhaps the most innocent man anywhere in the history of the United States. Now a friend of mine called me up, very smart guy. He said, “I can’t imagine anybody could go through two and a half years, $48 million, 18 killers, some of whom worked for Hillary Clinton, right? Crooked Hillary. And it turned out they’re the ones dealing with Russia. What a disgrace.” So let’s see what happens. It’s too bad it’s going so slowly. There’s plenty of info there, and I try and stay uninvolved. Someday I’m going to have to get involved, maybe. I try and stay uninvolved. Going too slowly. “No sir, we’d rather not do anything before the election.” Well they did it to me before, they did during, before, and after. These are bad people, Comey, the worst director in the history of the FBI. A crooked person. Did you leak? Remember? “Chuck Grassley. Did you leak the information to the newspapers?” He choked when he heard Chuck Grassley from Iowa, great gentleman, great gentleman. He looked at that guy, he said, “Did you leak?” And he said, “Yes.” He choked. You know the guy choked like a dog, Comey. He leaked, he lied, he did a lot of things. You saw the report by Inspector General Horowitz, who by the way did a great report. That was a great report, Inspector General Horowitz, and I appreciate it. But you saw that on Comey. Comey should hang his head in disgrace. But we had to go through all this stuff. Think if we didn’t have any of it. We probably wouldn’t have done as well. It’s true. We might not have done as well. And we might not have these massive crowds, because you saw what was happening. You got it. We might not have had … So I just want to tell you, we appreciate you so much. We really do. We appreciate you so much. And now we have to build on what we’ve done. Nobody has done what we’ve done. No administration has done, thank you. Wow, I love you too. I love you too. Thank you very much. Thank you. That’s really nice. You know, in the history of politics, nobody’s ever heard that expression before, it’s true. Look, Ronald Reagan, we liked Ronald Reagan, right, but nobody ever said, “We love you, We love you.” Nobody’s ever heard it before. Nobody’s ever heard it before. It’s an expression, true, you know they were covering it the other night, they looking back, oh, they want to find it so badly. They want to find somebody so badly. But it’s never been said before to the best of anyone’s knowledge, and we appreciate it. I’ll tell you what, when you hear that, I had a nice life. I had the greatest life. But you know what? I’m so happy. This was the greatest decision I ever made, because we have done so much good together. We’ve done it together. We couldn’t have done it without you, and we’ve done so much, from the biggest tax cuts in history, to regulation cuts, the biggest ever. We have cut regulations at a level that nobody believed. It would take 18 to 20 years to get a highway approved. We have it down to two. It’ll soon be down to one, and it may not get approved. It may be an environmental problem. It may be a safety problem, but it shouldn’t take 20 years, it shouldn’t take 19 years, 21 years. And by the time you get it approved, first of all, you start off as a young man on a highway project, and you end up in retirement, and then you get a rejection. ” We rejected three to two,” some board somewhere. No, we’ve done a great job, and we’ve rebuilt our military. We just got a 91% approval from our veterans. The veterans just gave us a 91% approval, highest we’ve ever gotten. With your vote, we will continue to cut your taxes, cut regulations, support our police, support our great military, protect your Second Amendment, which has gone if sleepy Joe Biden gets … Defend religious liberty, and ensure more products are proudly made with that beautiful, beautiful phrase, right? “Made in the USA.” Next year we will be, and I mean this, I think we have such a foundation-This group over here. They’re an activist group. Thank you very much. Thank you, fellas. It’s a great group. Thank you. Thank you very much. We appreciate it. Next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country. So you had last year was the best year you ever had. Before that was the best year. You had three of them with me, and then we got hit with the plague, and then we went back to work. Under my leadership, our economy is now growing at the fastest rate ever recorded. 33.1% last week. And if you look at the auto business, auto business, I don’t know what’s going on. It’s at a level that it’s never been at. What is that all about? What is that all about? You wouldn’t think, and this is during a pandemic. We’re rounding the turn, by the way. They hate it when I say it, but we’re rounding the turn. They used to say, “Look at the way Europe’s doing.” Well, take a look at Europe. Take a look. And what we’ve done in terms of the economy, we went down less than any major country in the world, or any country. And now we’ve gone up far faster and far higher than any country in the world. It’s not even close. And it should be tougher because of the size, because we’re a big country. We created a record 11.4 million jobs in the last five months alone, which is another record. That’s another big record. We’ve never hired that many people that fast. While foreign nations are in a free fall, we’re creating an economic powerhouse unrivaled anywhere in the world. A recent Gallup Poll found that 56% of Americans say they are better off today than they were four years ago under Obama and Biden. And if Biden and Kamala … You don’t have to say it “Kamala.” “Kamala.” If Biden and Kamala Harris, who’s further left by far than crazy Bernie Sanders, right, he’s considered a strict conservative compared to her. How the hell did he ever pick her, Mike? Where’s Mike. How did that ever happen? That turned out … I don’t think that’s going to be a good pick. You’re going to find out tomorrow. By the way, she happens to be slightly against fracking. She’s still against fracking. Isn’t that amazing? Isn’t that amazing? Biden goes like, “I’m against …” For a year and a half, he’s running, running. Nobody gave him a chance because he never got more than 1% in prime time, right? 25 years ago, the guy never got 1%. And he never had what it took. He was a glad hander. Not a smart guy. Not a nice guy, either. By the way, not a nice guy. But he was, I used to call him 1% Joe, because he ran for president all the time and he never got more than 1%. Now he’s got half the intelligence he had 20 years ago and he wins. Politics is a strange business. A strange, very strange business. But if Biden and Harris and the radical left gain power, they will collapse our economy and send our nation into a very steep depression. That’s what’s going to happen. This is the only man that I’ve ever seen run for office on the fact that he wants to give you the largest tax increase in the history of our country. No, that’s his space. The good news is, he has no idea what the hell he’s saying, so it doesn’t … He goes up. Here’s his line. “Ladies and gentlemen, we are going to give you the biggest tax increase in the history of our country. It will be $4 trillion.” They’re going to increase your taxes by $4 trillion. $4 trillion tax increase. That’s his campaign, and they’re going to put the money in the Green New Deal, which is conceived and designated by AOC plus three, right? AOC plus … This was their deal. I think they ever took an environmental course. Did they go to college, by the way? I don’t think they ever took a course on the environment. But Biden wants to raise your taxes $4 trillion, massively increase regulations. You know, the regulations may have been more important than even the big tax cuts that you got. The biggest ever. You got the biggest tax cuts ever, and you know it. You know it. You felt that in a very, very good place. You know where it is? Your wallet. You felt it in your wallet. They want to close down your factories, send your jobs overseas, destroy the suburbs. Women of the suburbs, please, okay? Please. I wiped out a regulation that would have destroyed your home, to put it mildly. Would have destroyed your American dream. And Ben Carson is a great guy. I said, “Sir, why don’t we just do this? Why don’t we just sort of ease it up?” It’s a horrible regulation. What it does is a horrible thing, and everybody knows it. It would have destroyed the suburbs. I said, “Ben, let’s just cut it out. Let’s terminate it because there’s no negotiating here. Let’s just terminate it.” And I terminated it. And you know one thing I know about? The women of the suburbs, they want two things. They want their home. They want their family night, but they want safety, and they want security. And that’s what we provide. And I think this will be like four years ago. Remember? “Donald Trump will do very poorly with women.” At the end of the evening when they’re all crying, and I remember they were crying. Remember? Martha Raddatz. Oh, she was very impartial. She was another one of my debate anchors. I had some real beauties, didn’t I? She was crying, and they all said we’re going to do badly with women. I’m going to do terribly with women. I said, “Why? What’s so bad? Tell me what’s so bad.” And at the end of the evening, “He’s done very well with women. What happened?” No. But this time we’re going to do even better, because we are providing safety and security. And for the suburban women, I mean, we’re saving the suburbs. This regulation was so horrible, what it does to the suburbs. It would have destroyed the suburbs as we knew them. And I got to say this, 31% of the people living and moving to the suburbs are minority groups, African American, Asian American, Hispanic American. And they have a great American dream also, and then they want to live in the suburbs and they want to be proud, and they don’t want to live next to a project that somebody puts in because they play games with your zoning and other things. And all I can say is, for the women … I don’t even talk about the men in the suburbs. I don’t care about the men in the suburbs. I only care because they’re all saying … He’s going, “Oh, what about us?” I don’t worry about you. But the women of the suburbs are going to vote for President Trump, because we love you, and we’re saving you a horrible, a horrible thing was going to happen, frankly, and it’s been happening for years, and it’s been a very bad situation. So we solved it. We terminated it. It is gone. Now, if they get in, if they should get in, you can take that regulation and quadruple it, just like they want to quadruple your taxes. You can quadruple it. So I think that’ll be good. I think we’re going to have a great … Women, that’s a pretty hard pitch, but that’s the way it is, right? They want to dissolve your borders. We complete the wall in a very short period of time. We’re over 400 miles. Over 400 miles, and that’s right, Mexico is paying for the wall. You know, they like to say Mexico is, but we will have the wall completed very shortly. We’re over 400 miles right now. 400 miles, and we’re building 10 miles a week, and we now have the strongest numbers and the strongest border, Southern border that we’ve ever had. And you know what? We want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally, and they have to come in through merit. We want people that can help us. We want people that can help us. They want to terminate religious liberty, outlaw private healthcare. 400 … Think of this. Think of this. Private healthcare. You work so hard. You have 180 million people that have a great healthcare plan, that love it. Private plans, and they want to end it and put you on socialized medicine. I don’t think so. I don’t think you’re going to be too happy. I don’t think … “We have a cold, let’s go to the hospital and let’s wait for nine days to see a doctor.” They want to confiscate your guns, Second Amendment, and indoctrinate your children with hateful anti-American lies. So you’ll be happy that I just signed on the plane, that’s beautiful Air Force One, and it is a beauty, I have to admit an executive order to teach our nation students pro-American values. That will be taught. Sleepy joe Biden has vowed to abolish and eradicate the American oil and natural gas industries, and he’s pledged to ban fracking. And you saw that. For a year, more than that, he’d get on stage with all these crazy people, radical left people, and they were screaming who could ban it faster. He would say, “Yes, I’d been fracking. I am totally against fracking.” For a year, “I am against fracking.” I could play 100 clips. See the board? Where is the board. I spent a lot of money for that today. He’s going, for a year, “I am against fracking.” Then he lucks out because Elizabeth Pocahontas Warren doesn’t get out, so she takes votes away from crazy Bernie, right? On Super Tuesday. And he loses by a little bit on each state, and Bernie loses again. This poor guy. Crazy Bernie. But he’s running again in four years. Don’t worry about it. No, he’s the best loser I’ve ever seen. He could lose … He lost with Hillary and they didn’t treat him too well. And then he lost, but Elizabeth Warren lost. If she would have gotten out, he would have had the votes. He would have won easily. So instead of a Crazy Bernie, I’m running against a sleepy guy, right? I’m running against a very sleepy guy. We can’t let the sleepy guy fool us, though, because he happens to be a corrupt politician, and they don’t want to write it. Biden’s energy plan will send every state into a crushing poverty situation, from Michigan to Minnesota. We’re going to win Minnesota because of Omar, and because we did a great job in stopping the riots in Minneapolis. The National Guard went in. They should have called them a lot sooner, like a week and a half. You wouldn’t have had half of your city burnt down. But Arizona, Pennsylvania. We’re doing great in Pennsylvania, by the way. I just got the word. I just got the word. We’re doing great in Pennsylvania. It’s looking good. I think you’re going to have a very exciting … You’re going to have a very exciting evening or day tomorrow, but evening in particular tomorrow. You know, when people see it, I walk in, we do polls, and they do a poll. “We interviewed 73 people, and President Trump is down 57 points.” This is a poll. See, this is a poll. When you draw crowds like this. This is not the crowd of somebody that’s going to lose the state of Michigan. This is not. This is not. And look at this crowd. You can’t even see the end of it. You can’t. This is not the crowd of a second place finisher. Do you agree with that? No. No. This is our crowd, all together. We’re in this together and we’re doing it together. As long as I’m President, we will remain the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere on this planet. And for the first time, we are energy independent. You never heard that term before. We’re energy independent, and you know, we have very good relationships in different parts of the world. In some we help. We don’t have to, though. Now we don’t have to do … We do what we want, but we have some very good allies and partners that we’ll help them, but we don’t need their oil anymore. We have so much oil. We have more oil than anybody, okay? And it’s an incredible thing that it’s happened over the last few years. A lot of great things. And you’re paying, what, $2 a gallon for your gasoline? That’s okay. You know what that’s like? That’s like a tax cut. That’s bigger than a tax cut. If Biden got in, you’d be paying $7, $8, $9. Then they’d say, “Get rid of your car. We’re going to build some more windmills. Kill all the birds.” Joe Biden is a globalist who spent 47 years outsourcing your jobs, opening your borders, and sacrificing American blood and treasure in endless foreign wars in countries that most of you have never even heard of, okay? A vote for Biden is a vote to eradicate your auto industry. Somehow I don’t think you want to do that in your particular state. He was a cheerleader for NAFTA, one of the worst trade deals ever made, and now we have USMCA, which is a great deal. What a difference. No, you were sending all your jobs. You know, 12 years ago, I was honored, believe it or not, the Man of the Year, and I was never thinking about doing this, the Man of the Year in Michigan. I’m still trying to figure out how that happened, and I got up and I said, “You know, you’re losing all your car business to Mexico, and Canada, too, by the way, and what are you doing? Why are you doing it?” And it was a whole big thing, became quite controversial as usual. But I was right, and it was probably the biggest reason that I ultimately ran for the presidency, because I saw how we were being ripped off. Not only the auto business, how we were being ripped off by every country of the world, friend and foe, on trade. And it just was something that was terrible. Now with the USMCA, they said there’s no way I would ever pull it off. “There’s no way you get rid of NAFTA.” You know why? Because Mexico and Canada loved it. I said, “Well, if they love it, that means it can’t be any good, right?” They said, “Sh, we never thought of that one.” So I wouldn’t say they’re exactly thrilled with USMCA, but we’re fine with it. We like it. But he was sending your auto jobs, so many of them, to Mexico, and it was terrible. Joe Biden supported China’s entry into the World Trade Organization, which was the beginning of a disaster. It was good for China, but it was sure as hell bad for us. But you know, we won seven and a half billion dollars a little while ago, because we wouldn’t win anything. They had no respect for this country whatsoever, and now they know that if they don’t treat us right, we’ll pull out of that deal so fast. Now all of a sudden we’re winning all these cases, but we just won seven and a half billion dollars, which would have been impossible with a different president. You are so lucky I’ve agreed to be your president. Go out and vote for Trump. The seven and a half billion dollars we won, that was nice. Michigan lost half of all of its auto manufacturing jobs, because that was like a Biden and his friends, that was a betrayal to you and to many other states. He supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would have eliminated your auto industry totally. I came in and immediately canceled it. I canceled it. I was so happy to cancel the TPP. I ended the NAFTA disaster. Canceled that one too. I’ve been an activist. Despite the fact that every week I’m being hit on all different sides, ” Let’s impeach him for having a perfect conversation with the President of Ukraine.” They were the ones that had the bad conversations, including his son making $183,000 a month to sit on the board of a company. His son. Where’s Hunter? Where’s Hunter? His first name is, “Where.” Where’s Hunter? Remember that? I brought that up. A t-shirt was made overnight. It was the hottest selling t-shirt of the year. “Where’s Hunter?” You know where Hunter is? He’s buying vacuum cleaners, because he follows his father and he vacuums in money from every country that his father sees. No, seriously, Ukraine. His father was a judge of Russia, Ukraine, and China. President Obama entrusted him with those three countries. Those are the three beauties, right? Russia, Ukraine. So Russia, Moscow, the mayor of Moscow, his wife gives him three and a half million dollars, Hunter. Now he got dismissed from the military, was unemployed. His father becomes Vice President, and now all of a sudden he’s raking in money like you never saw. Now you tell me, is that honest? And then they say the big guy gets 10%. The big guy in some cases gets 50%. And then the last one is he asked China for $10 million here. This is Biden. They asked for $10 million, yeah, $10 million for introductory purposes. That’s what … Introductory purposes. So he’s going to introduce people to who? To his father, for which he gets $10 million a year. I never saw anything like this. And the fake news refuses to report it, because they don’t want it in there, because it’s not good for them. How about the Moscow? Three and a half million dollars from the wife of the mayor of Moscow. Three and a half million dollars to, “Where’s Hunter?” You know, ” Where’s Hunter?” He’s at the bank depositing his money. Now think of it. So he gets a billion and a half from China. He goes with his father on Air Force Two, a plane that the great Vice President Mike Pence uses too. Mike, do your kids follow you to the various countries, raking in money? No. He’s got the greatest people, the greatest children, the greatest family. I don’t think they have, right, where they’re flying airplanes for our military. No they don’t. They do it a little differently. They do it the old fashioned way. No. Mike Pence, it’s a holder. I always compare … I say, “Can you imagine with Mike Pence?” How good we have it with Mike Pence compared to that. No, it’s great. How about the China, though? So the kid has no investment experience whatsoever. His father and him, they go into Air Force Two. In 10 minutes, like a 10-minute meeting, he walks out with a billion and a half dollars from China. They don’t do this for the biggest investment firms. I spoke to a friend of mine who’s one of the biggest guys on Wall Street. He said, “No, this is never done. They invest their own money. They don’t need people that are much dumber than them to invest their money. They invest their own money. They don’t do that.” Then he said, “Wow. That’s amazing. How long did it take him to get the money?” “About 10 minutes.” Walks out with a billion and a half dollars to invest, which is millions of dollars a year. And the fake news and big tech, big tech is getting very dangerous, very dangerous, but it’s one of the reasons we have to win. They have me trending every day on Twitter, Twitter Trending. They make up these stories, phony stores. They put up stories or they’ll take an old story, make it as bad. “Number one trend,” like some really boring story. Trending is like, you got to be cool, right? To trend. I’m trending number one, number two, number three. Everyone, “Negative, negative, negative.” How the hell did I ever win this thing? It’s such a fix with these people. I’m always trending with these stories that are like, either they didn’t happen, or they make them different. And I don’t want to act like a complainer, but it’s a totally rigged deal. And everyone said four years ago, they said, “Sir, you can’t win.” “Why?” “Because big tech is against you.” I said, “What’s big tech?” I didn’t even know what the hell it was, right? I learned fast, because I think we’re number one in the world now on social, so we learned very well. We got a lot of people. You know what? If I didn’t have … They say, “Don’t tweet.” Forget the tweet. It’s called social media. If we didn’t have social media, I’d have no voice. We wouldn’t be here. I have no choice. They say, “Gee, we wish she wouldn’t do so much tweeting.” I don’t do tweeting. What I do is social media. And without it, I don’t think we’d be here, because we’d have no voice. There’s no voice with these people. They’re dishonest people, mostly. Not in all cases, but Joe Biden is a corrupt politician who, what he’s done is he’s bled America dry. In 2016, Michigan voted to fire this corrupt political establishment, and you elected an outsider as president who is finally putting America first. And if I don’t sound like a typical Washington politician, it’s because, thank you, I’m not a politician. Thank you very much. If I don’t always play by the rules of Washington and the Washington establishment, it’s because it was elected to fight for you, and I fight for you harder than anyone has ever fought for you before. Joe Biden is bought and paid for by big tech, big media, and powerful special interests. That’s why he takes in $300 million. They taken millions and millions of dollars for his crazy campaign, and he’s not going to win. I really don’t believe he’s going to win, because of this. Take a look. This is going on all over the country. They have tractors, thousands of tractors. You ever see this? Thousands in Iowa. We’re winning an Iowa very big, by the way, just in case. Thousands of tractors in Iowa on big farms, thousands and thousands. They have thousands of boats, 6,000 boats out in the lake, out in the ocean. They have things nobody’s ever seen anything like it. So I think we’re going to have a very big day, but they say you can’t win without big tech. Well, we’re going to find out tomorrow. Wouldn’t that be wonderful? But they said the same thing, they said the same thing four years ago. The head of CNN said, “You can’t win without CNN.” I said, “Really?” And we won, so now we have to do it again. They’re totally crooked. They’re fake news. CNN is fake. CNN and the others are fake news. They own Biden. They control him, and they know that he will always do their bidding. Every corrupt force in American life that betrayed you and hurt you is supporting Joe Biden. The failed establishment that started the disastrous foreign wars that hurt our country so badly and hurt our young people so badly, they support Sleepy Joe Biden. The career politicians that offshored your industries and decimated your factories and sent your jobs away, they support Biden. The open border lobbyists that killed our fellow citizens with illegal drugs and gangs and crime, they support Biden. The far left Democrats that ruined our public schools, depleted our inner cities, defunded our police, and demeaned your sacred faith and values, they support Biden. The anti-American radicals defaming our noble history, heritage, and heroes, they support Sleepy Joe Biden. Antifa, and the rioters, looters, Marxists, and left wing extremists, they all support Biden. This election comes down to a very simple choice. Do you want to be ruled by the corrupt and selfless political maniacs that you’re dealing with? Or do you want to be ruled by the American people? You’re supposed to be ruled by the American people. Do you want to be represented by a career politician who hates you, by an outsider? I mean, just take a look. These people, what they do and what they get away with, and I guess that’s the other reason. I mean, I was in politics and I see what’s been happening to our country. Our country was going to hell, and we’ve turned it. And we got waylaid by this plague that came in, but we’ve done a job like nobody else has ever done a job, and you understand it. And that’s why there’s so many of you here tonight, and that’s why all over the country, this is happening. All over the country. And even they’re just springing up by themselves. I’m not there. I don’t do this. I mean, if you look, they had something today I read where 100 miles of cars all with the flag, the American flag, the Trump, a whole Trump thing. But do you want to be represented by a career politician who actually doesn’t like you, or by an outsider who will defend you like you have never been defended before? That’s what I’m doing. And it’s not easy, but there’s nothing I’ve ever enjoyed more in my life, because we are making so much progress. We have to now finish the progress. A vote for Biden is a vote to hand the keys of government over to people who don’t like you, don’t respect you, and who want to rob your children of their American dream. We have a great American dream. We’re not going to let it happen. We’re not going to let that happen. We’re going to keep our great American dream. A vote for Biden is a vote to give control of government over to the globalists, and communists, and socialists, and wealthy, liberal hypocrites, and all of those that want to silence, censor, cancel, and punish you. If you want your children to be safe, if you want your values to be honored, if you want your life to be treated with dignity and respect, then I am asking you to go to the poll tomorrow and vote, vote, vote. Remember what I said four years ago. I am your voice, and we will make America great again, and that’s what we’re doing. For the last four years, the depraved swamp has tried everything to stop me and to stop you, because they know I don’t answer to them. I answer to you. That’s why we’re here. That’s why we’re here. Together we will defeat the corrupt establishment. We will dethrone the failed political class, and we will drain the Washington swamp. And we will save that American dream. That beautiful, beautiful American dream. This election is a choice between a deadly Biden lockdown, open up your state, governor, or a safe vaccine that ends up the pandemic and leads to the greatest economy in the history of the world. That’s where we’re going. We were there, and we’re going to get it back very quickly. And that’s going to bring our whole country together, because success brings it together, and it was happening. Before that plague came in, it was happening. People were calling me that you would least suspect, and it was all happening. And then we had to close it down and now build it up, and it’s building … It’s not a V. It’s a super V. It’s a super V. We will mass distribute the vaccine in just a few short weeks. It will quickly eradicate the virus and wipe out the China plague once and for all. And whether we have the vaccine, great companies, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, Pfizer, but with or without it, we are rounding the turn. Just remember that. You know, they don’t like it. They hate it when I say that we’re rounding the turn. And they always use Europe. “Oh, look at Europe. Look at Europe.” Well, take a look at Europe. Look at how they’re doing. And their economy is in tatters, and they have a lot of problems, and we don’t want that. We don’t want that. And that should have never happened. Should have never happened. That should have never been allowed to happen. Joe Biden is promising to delay the vaccine and turn America into a prison state. He’s looking you in the face and he’s locking you in your home while letting rioters, Antifa, the radical left, run down your streets, riot in your streets, burn down your stores, beat you over the head, and they’re allowed to do that. But you can’t go to your church. You can’t have dinner with your family, but you’re allowed to protest and riot. That’s why I call all of these protests, because we’re allowed to protest. You’re not allowed to meet and you’re not allowed to pray together, but you’re allowed to protest, so I call everything that we do a protest. The Biden lockdown will mean no school, no graduations, no weddings, no Thanksgivings, no Easters, no Christmas, no 4th of July, no future for the youth. Other than that, it’s actually quite good. A vote for Sleepy Joe Biden is a vote for lockdowns, lay offs, and misery. If you want a vaccine to kill the virus, by the way, he would have been so far behind on a vaccine. He would have been so far behind. He did the swine flu. It was the joke of … They didn’t know what the hell they were doing. Now he’s saying, ” He should have acted faster.” Except when I did the ban on China, he said I shouldn’t do it for two and a half months. Then he admitted he wrong too, and then he runs, and now he’s saying I should have acted. I was so early in doing that ban, and we saved … And our biggest critic admits that we saved thousands and thousands of lives by doing it. Thousands of lives. And the ventilators that were made, and all of the things that we’ve done, and all of the medicines that are coming out. And here I am, right? Here I am. And I’m sure it had nothing to do with the medicine. I used to sort of give the medicine a little bit of credit, now I give it none, because I’m a perfect physical specimen, and I’m a very young person. I’m a very young person. I said that, of course, a little bit sarcastically. I said it a couple of weeks ago. I said, “No, no, I’m better than perfect. I mean, it was very quick, very easy because I’m in perfect physical shape and I’m a very young man,” and CNN went crazy, “He is not in great shape, and he is not a young…” But they went totally crazy. They are definitely, seriously losers. Could you imagine if they had a cover of sleepy Joe for four years, their ratings would tank. That’s why football is not doing well. First of all, they’re not going to do well, basketball was down 71%, their finals. You know why? Because our people want to see people that respect our country, respect our anthem and respect our flag. And football is way down. But you know, they’re down for that reason, but they’re also down because people would rather watch this stuff than watch football, because this is much tougher. They consider this to be much tougher actually. But can you imagine if they covered sleepy Joe, the ratings are phenomenal for all of these things. And then they cover sleepy Joe, their ratings would tank. They would come to see me, “Sir, I think it’s really important that you run again because we are losing our networks, our ratings are down the tubes.” The failing New York Times will definitely be out of business very quickly. They used to write nothing about me, now I average probably about four or five stories a day on the front page. Someday they’re going to give me a good one, watch. It might be tomorrow. We got to have a big win. We want a big win, not just a wave, we want a big win. Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates said about Biden that he was wrong on nearly every single major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades. He’s been wrong on everything. He’s been wrong on everything. But don’t believe me, because you’re Michigan, I spent all of this money on these beautiful, very large television sets. I call them beautiful, large screens. They’re large television sets. Let’s see it for yourself, okay. Go ahead. Thank you very much. Look, you can’t let this happen to our country. Okay? We know what’s going on. You can’t let this. This was a total fluke. This was a total fluke. In prime time he didn’t work and now it’s really not working. What a disaster. I can’t believe this is even happening. It puts much more pressure on me running against a guy like this. You lost to somebody that was good, can you imagine the concept of losing to this guy? You better get out there and vote tomorrow. I will be so angry I will never come back to Michigan, I’ll never come back. I’ll tell Japan to bring all those plants they held back. Joining us tonight are some great warriors, great people. Congressman Bill Huizenga. Bill, where is Bill? Thank you very much. Everything good? You’re doing great. Thank you, Bill. Congressional candidate, Peter Meijer. Peter, where’s Peter? Where’s Peter? Peter, you don’t have a good location. What happened to Peter? Peter’s here someplace and I hear he’s doing great. House Speaker, Lee Chatfield. Lee? Thank you, Lee, great job you’re doing. RNC Chair, I’ll tell you what a job she did. What a job she did. Ronna McDaniel. Where are you Ronna?. What a job she’s done. We won this great state with her leadership. Thank you, Ronna, very much, great job. State GOP Chair, Laura Cox. Laura? Good job. Are we going to win? Otherwise, we will fire you so fast. No, I think we’re going to have a tremendous victory in Michigan. I think we’re going to have a tremendous victory in all of these States they’re talking about, I see all of them. We’re going to have a tremendous evening, I hope so. For the good of our country, I hope so. You see the alternative, I’m sorry. But this is not just an alternative. We’re doing a great job, but we want to keep it going. Okay. We got to keep it going and we’re going to. A very special person. Medal of Honor recipient, Jim McCloughan. Jim, where are you? Great job. He’s a very brave one. Thank you very much, Jim. Congratulations, that’s a great honor. Our highest honor. Ted Nugent, and he is great. Where is Ted? Great job, Ted. He’s been from day one, right, Ted? Great job. Thank you very much for everything. I appreciate it. I love your sound. I love your music. And speaking of sound, music and other things, one of the big superstars of the world, Little Pimp. There he is. How’s it going? Do you want to come up and say something? Come on. Lil Pump, come on up here, come on up here. Does everyone know who he is? You know how big he is? Come on up here. It’s a nice hat. Come on, say something. Thank you. That’s great, thank you very much, I appreciate it. That’s very nice. Big star, big star. That’s very impressive. For 47 years, Joe Biden viciously attacked black Americans. He called young black men, super predators. To every black American, I am asking you to get out tomorrow and vote. This is your one and only chance. Thank you. Thank you, man. Thank you very much. To show Joe Biden what you think of his decision to attack you, to jail you, to betray you and I’m fighting for you and you know what we’ve done? What we’ve done is really something that nobody thought could have happened. Other administrations, in particular, the last administration didn’t make even a move to try and get it done. We got criminal justice reform done. We got prison reform done. We got opportunities zones all done and complete. Tim Scott. We had funding for historically black colleges and universities completed and done, and it’s an honor to have done it. And I say it all the time, with the exception of Abraham Lincoln, no president has done as much for the black community as President Trump. And I’m very proud of that, very proud of that. Thank you. It’s been an honor. It’s been an honor. Biden has vowed to increase refugee admissions from terrorist nations by over 700%, including from Syria, Somalia and Yemen. The Biden plan would overwhelm your communities and turn Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and the entire Midwest into a virtual refugee camp. I am keeping radical Islamic terrorists, if you don’t mind, the hell out of our country. And if you take a look at France over the last week, they’re having a devastating problem. Another problem happened today, a very big problem in Europe and we don’t want it. We don’t want that problem. We don’t need it. We don’t want it. We invested $2.5 trillion in the United States military, biggest investment we’ve ever made. We are the envy of every country, militarily, Russia, China, North Korea. Everybody looks at what we have, nobody. Tanks, F35s, super fighter jets, tankers, submarines, missiles, rockets, hypersonic missiles, they go seven times faster than our fastest missile, fastest in the world. All of the things we’ve done in our nuclear plants and our nuclear capability is now at the highest level and it’s all in tippy top shape. And you just have to pray to God that we’d never used it. That’s all we say. Pray to God that we never use it. We have the best in the world, all by the way, made in the USA and made a lot of it made right here in Michigan. A lot of it made right here in Michigan. We also passed VA veterans choice and veterans accountability, VA accountability. 91%. We killed the leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi. We eliminated the world’s top terrorist, Soleimani is dead. I recognized the capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, had been working on that for 52 years. And instead of endless wars, we are now forging peace in the Middle East, and we’re getting it done. It’s going to happen very quickly, you watch. A vote for me and The Republican Party is a vote for the American dream. And remember, Abraham Lincoln was a proud member of The Republican Party, Abraham Lincoln. In conclusion, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we will end our reliance on China once and for all, which is already taking place. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. With God’s help, we will defend the right to life, religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms, your second amendment. Which is under siege, but it’s 100% secure with us in this position, Mike, right? We will never touch it. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency, which goes into effect on January 1st, bigger than healthcare. Lower drug prices even more. We have signed and done something that’s never been done on prescription drug prices, favored nations. It will bring drug prices down 50, 60, 70%, like you’ve never seen before. And the drug companies, big pharma, does not exactly like your favorite president, I will tell you, but that’s okay. We broke a log jam. Favored nations, nobody thought we’d ever do that, we did. And we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. That’s starting very soon. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, in God we trust. For years you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of Michigan. Tomorrow, you have the power, with the power of your vote, but you have a power to save America, for this country will never be a socialist nation. We will never allow that to happen. Together we can finish the job and drain the Washington swamp once and for all. Nobody knew it was so deep and so vicious, but we have done some job. So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers and get out and vote. Most important election perhaps in the history of our country. I never thought I’d say that. After what we went through four years ago, I said, “There’ll never be anything like that. Never be anything like what we went through.” And this is the most important election, maybe in the history of our country, from Midland to Mackinac, from Pontiac to Battle Creek and from Detroit to right here in Grand Rapids, I love Grand Rapids. We inherit the legacy of American patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears to defend our country, our families, and our freedom. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the ocean, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, laid down the railroads, raised up the great skyscrapers, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America into the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And the best is yet to come. The best is yet to come. Proud citizens like you, who helped build this country, together we will take back our country. We’re taking it back at a level that nobody has believed. We are taking it back and we are winning and we’re going to win tomorrow. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family and one glorious nation under God and together with the incredible people of Michigan, we have made America powerful again. Our military, it’s never been like this. We have made America wealthy again. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again. We have made America safe again and we will make America great again. Thank you, Michigan. Go out and vote. Thank you very much. Thank you.

"105","11-03-20","We’re set for a tremendous success and success is going to bring unity. And it was bringing it before and then we got hit with the China virus and that certainly, you had to go back and I think we’ve done an incredible job with respect to that. Other than public relations, because, and I’m not sure that it’s possible to convince you of it because, you know, you people were not really convincible no matter what we did. But we’ve done an incredible job, not only in handling it, don’t forget we were expecting, and people were projecting 2.2 million people. We closed up the greatest economy in the history of the world, for any country, not just for our country, and we are now opening it up. We saved more than 2 million lives and did an incredible job with therapies and therapeutics and with, I think, maybe cures because frankly, some of this stuff is so good. But, if you look at the ventilator situation, we had a ventilator problem and now with all the work that everybody’s done, including Jared, people coming in from Silicon Valley, and now we’re sending the ventilators all over. I mean, all over the world now, all over the world, we’re producing them for other countries. But it’s been an incredible period of time. And I think that if you look at, and I say it and I say it proudly, we are rounding the corner, but the vaccines are coming out very soon. They’re having tremendous success, Johnson and Johnson, Moderna, Pfizer, and we’re going to have something, we’re going to have a very special year. Next year, I think is going to be more successful than it was last year. We had the best year we’ve ever had last year and I think we’re going to be right in that category for next year. So that’s very successful. No, I’m not thinking about concession speech or acceptance speech yet. Hopefully we’ll be only doing one of those two and, you know, winning is easy. Losing is never easy, not for me it’s not. But I think we have, when you see rallies, the likes of which in the history of this country, probably in the history of the world, nobody’s ever seen before. There’s a tremendous love going on in this country and there’s really a tremendous unity. There’s a tremendous unity. Nobody’s ever seen that, where you take an airport and the airport is not big enough to hold the crowds. Nobody’s ever seen a thing like that. And our opposition, as you know, would have a few people sitting in circles and that’s okay. That’s not abnormal. That’s not abnormal, actually. I mean, that’s the way it is. But we would get crowds of 50,000 people, 45,000 people, more. Nobody’s ever seen anything like that. So, it was an honor. They’re great people. These are people that, they appreciate what we did and they also remember before I got there and before we all got there. This group has been with me, a lot of them are very young, but they’ve been with me, many of them for a long time, right? A long time. And I just want, I really came here to thank you all. And then I’m going to say and get immediately back to work. But I want to thank you. Well, we spent a lot of time in Pennsylvania. It’s always been a very good place for me. I went to college there, it’s always been good. I think Pennsylvania is very important. Florida is very important, obviously. A lot of people talked about Texas and Texas is, we will have a tremendous victory there based on, you know, everything that you see. This is no longer polls, this is now we’re looking at what’s happening. It will be a tremendous victory in Texas. I’m hearing we’re doing tremendously well in Arizona. I think we’re doing well all over. Yeah? Well, I think you’ll know possibly tonight, depending on the extent of a victory. I think you could know tonight. I think the ruling on Pennsylvania was an unfortunate one by the Supreme Court, because I think we should know what happens on the night. Let people put their ballots in earlier, but you have to have numbers. You can’t have these things delayed for many days and maybe weeks, you can’t do that. The whole world is waiting. This country is waiting, but the whole world is waiting. And a lot of shenanigans, a lot of bad things happen with ballots. When you say, “Oh, let’s devote days and days.” And all of a sudden the ballot count changes. And you take a look at Philadelphia, the history of Philadelphia politics. No, I don’t put people on their honor code. I don’t think it’s right and I think it’s a very dangerous thing that they’ve done with that decision and maybe their wisdom will change that decision or maybe we’ll go back and give them a right to change it. But that’s a terrible, it’s a very dangerous decision for this country, what they did with Pennsylvania and some others also. You have to have a date and the date happens to be November 3rd, and we should be entitled to know who won on November 3rd. And if somebody comes along and puts a ballot in way late, they shouldn’t be, they should put the ballot in earlier. There’s no reason why they can’t put the ballot in two weeks earlier or one week earlier. I think it’s a very dangerous decision for our country in many ways dangerous, in many ways. Yeah? Well, I may, I mean, we’re going to have to see, we have a big night planned. We’re going to have a very big night. I just think we’re going to have a tremendous, I think we’re going to have a… Look I’m looking at, right now I’m looking at different locations and we’re seeing lines of people and they’re wearing a lot of red material, including hats. But no, we’re seeing, in certain areas that would be Trump areas, we’re seeing lines of people that are extended or miles. You’re seeing it too. I mean, you don’t have to say, but you’re seeing it too. So, I think we’re going to have a great night, but it’s politics and it’s elections and you never know. I can say that Texas, Arizona, a few of them are looking really very, very strong, Florida looking very, very strong. They spent hundreds of millions of dollars in Florida, but the people of Florida, they know I love them and they love me. You know, we just have a automatic bond. Yeah, please. No, I don’t think we’re going to have any slippage. I think we’re going to have, look, my relationship to seniors, I happen to be a senior. I don’t want to say that too loud in this group. People that are averaging about 20 years old, but I don’t think we’re going to have anything. I think if anything, we’re going to do very well. I have seen and we have seen African-Americans way up and Hispanic Americans way up and people have seen that. And, you know, I’ve said that with regard to African American, the Black community, I’ve done more than any other president with the exception of Abraham Lincoln. And sometimes I say with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln, but let’s give him a lot of credit, right? But I’ve done more than any other president in the history of this country for African-American, the Black community and they understand the criminal justice reform, prison reform, historically Black colleges and universities. You look at what we’ve done. Opportunity zones with Tim Scott of South Carolina who’s great. Nobody’s done what I’ve done in terms of the African-American community. So, and they see it and they’re tired of being used by the Democrats for a hundred years. I mean, it’s been a hundred years. So I think we’re doing very well there and I’ve heard we’re doing very well with the Hispanic community. What’s that? Well you’ll see that in the filings. We had plenty of money, I will tell you. We had plenty of money. And what I didn’t do is call up Wall Street and say, “Send me $25 million to the head of every firm. I could have done that. I would have been the all time King of fundraising if I did that. But once you do that, you can no longer deal properly with them. You just can’t. So I didn’t do that. We could have done that. I could have raised much more money. I mean, Hillary Clinton spent much more money than I did. And in this case, when they raise that much money, that means to me they’re making deals and that can’t happen. So thank you very much. We’ll, maybe see you later. Have an exciting day. And for you, I just appreciate everything you’ve all done and we’ll see you soon, okay?
















"
"106","11-04-20","Well, thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Please sit. Thank you. This is without question the latest news conference I’ve ever had. Thank you. I appreciate it very much. And I want to thank the American people for their tremendous support, millions and millions of people voted for us tonight. And a very sad group of people is trying to disenfranchise that group of people and we won’t stand for it. We will not stand for it. I want to thank the first lady, my entire family, and Vice President Pence, Mrs. Pence for being with us all through this. And we were getting ready for a big celebration. We were winning everything and all of a sudden it was just called off. The results tonight have been phenomenal and we are getting ready… I mean, literally we were just all set to get outside and just celebrate something that was so beautiful, so good. Such a vote, such a success to citizens of this country have come out in record numbers. This is a record. There’s never been anything like it to support our incredible movement. We won states that we weren’t expected to win. Florida, we didn’t win it. We won it by a lot. We won the great State of Ohio. We won Texas, we won Texas. We won Texas. We won Texas by 700,000 votes and they don’t even include it in the tabulations. It’s also clear that we have won Georgia. We’re up by 2.5% or 117,000 votes with only 7% left. They’re never going to catch us. They can’t catch us. Likewise we’ve clearly won North Carolina. Where we’re up 1.4%. We’re 77,000 votes with only approximately 5% left. They can’t catch us. We also, if you look and you see Arizona, we have a lot of life in that. And somebody declared that it was a victory for… And maybe it will be. I mean, that’s possible. But certainly there were a lot of votes out there that we could get because we’re now just coming into what they call Trump territory. I don’t know what you call it. But these were friendly Trump voters. And that could be overturned. The gentleman that called it, I watched tonight. He said, “Well, we think it’s fairly unlikely that he could catch.” Well, fairly unlikely? And we don’t even need it. We don’t need that. That was just a state that if we would have gotten it, it would have been nice. Arizona. But there’s a possibility, maybe even a good possibility. In fact, since I saw that originally it’s been changed and the numbers have substantially come down just in a small amount of votes. So we want that obviously to stay in play. But most importantly, we’re winning Pennsylvania by a tremendous amount of votes. We’re up 600… Think of this. Think of this. Think of this. We’re up 690,000 votes in Pennsylvania, 690,000. These aren’t even close. This is not like, “Oh, it’s close…” With 64% of the vote in, it’s going to be almost impossible to catch. And we’re coming into good Pennsylvania areas where they happen to like your president. I mean, it’s very good. So we’ll probably expand that. We’re winning Michigan, but I’ll tell you, I looked at the numbers. I said, “Wow.” I looked, I said, “Wow, that’s a lot.” By almost 300,000 votes and 65% of the vote is in and we’re winning Wisconsin. And I said, “Well, we don’t need all of them. We need…” Because when you add Texas in, which wasn’t added, I spoke with the really wonderful governor of Texas just a little while ago, Greg Abbott, he said, “Congratulations.” He called me to congratulate me on winning Texas. I mean, we won Texas. I don’t think they finished quite the tabulation, but there’s no way. And it was almost complete, but he congratulated me. Then he said, “By the way, what’s going on? I’ve never seen anything like this.” Can I tell you what, nobody has. So we won by 107,000 votes with 81% of the vote. That’s Michigan. So when you take those three states in particular and you take all of the others, I mean, we have so many… We had such a big night. You just take a look at all of these states that we’ve won tonight, and then you take a look at the kind of margins that we’ve won it by, and all of a sudden, it’s not like we’re up 12 votes and we have 60% left. We won states. And all of a sudden I said, “What happened to the election? It’s off.” And we have all these announcers saying what happened? And then they said, “Oh.” Because you know what happened? They knew they couldn’t win so they said, “Let’s go to court.” And did I predict this, Newt? Did I say this? I’ve been saying this from the day I heard they were going to send out tens of millions of ballots. They said exactly, because either they were going to win or if they didn’t win, they’ll take us to court. So Florida was a tremendous victory. 377,000 votes. Texas, as we said. Ohio, think of this. Ohio a tremendous state, a big state. I love Ohio. We won by 8.1%, 460,00…think of this. Almost 500,000 votes. North Carolina, a big victory with North Carolina. So we won there. We lead by 76,000 votes with almost nothing left. And all of a sudden everything just stopped. This is a fraud on the American public. This is an embarrassment to our country. We were getting ready to win this election. Frankly, we did win this election. We did win this election. So our goal now is to ensure the integrity for the good of this nation. This is a very big moment. This is a major fraud in our nation. We want the law to be used in a proper manner. So we’ll be going to the US Supreme Court. We want all voting to stop. We don’t want them to find any ballots at four o’clock in the morning and add them to the list. Okay? It’s a very sad moment. To me this is a very sad moment and we will win this. And as far as I’m concerned, we already have won it. So I just want to thank you. I want to thank all of our support. I want to thank all of the people that worked with us. And Mr. Vice President, say a few words, please. Please. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.


















"
"107","11-05-20","Thank you very much. Thank you. Good evening. I’d like to provide the American people with an update on our efforts to protect the integrity of our very important 2020 election. If you count the legal votes, I easily win. If you count the illegal votes, they can try to steal the election from us. If you count the votes that came in late, we’re looking to them very strongly, but a lot of votes came in late. I’ve already decisively won many critical states, including massive victories in Florida, Iowa, Indiana, Ohio, to name just a few. We won these and many other victories despite historic election interference from big media, big money, and big tech. As everybody saw, we won by historic numbers, and the pollsters got it knowingly wrong. They got it knowingly wrong. We had polls that were so ridiculous and everybody knew it at the time. There was no blue wave that they predicted. They thought there was going to be a big blue wave. That was false. That was done for suppression reasons. But instead there was a big red wave, and it’s been properly acknowledged actually by the media. They were, I think, very impressed, but that was after the fact. That doesn’t do us any good. We kept the Senate despite having twice as many seats to defend as Democrats, and in a really much more competitive states. We did a fantastic job with the Senate. I think we’re very proud of what’s happened there. We had many more seats to defend. They spent almost $200 million on Senate races in South Carolina and Kentucky alone, two races, and hundreds of millions of dollars overall against us. At the national level, our opponents major donors were Wall Street bankers and special interests. Our major donors were police officers, farmers, everyday citizens. Yet for the first time ever, we lost zero races in the House. I was talking to Kevin McCarthy today. He said he couldn’t believe it. Zero racist, very unusual thing, zero, and actually won many new seats with, I think, many more on the way. This was also the year of the Republican woman. More Republican women were elected to Congress than ever before. That’s a great achievement. I won the largest share of non-white voters of any Republican in 60 years, including historic numbers of Latino, African American, Asian American, and Native American voters. The largest ever in our history. We grew our party by 4 million voters. The greatest turnout in Republican Party history. Democrats are the party of the big donors. The big media, the big tech, it seems, and Republicans have become the party of the American worker, and that’s what’s happened. And we’re also, I believe the party of inclusion. As everyone now recognizes, media polling was election interference in the truest sense of that word, by powerful special interests. These really phony polls, I have to call them phony polls, fake polls, were designed to keep our voters at home, create the illusion of momentum for Mr. Biden and diminish Republican’s ability to raise funds. They were what’s called suppression polls, everyone knows that now, and it’s never been used to the extent that it’s been used on this last election. To highlight just a few examples, the day before election, Quinnipiac, which was wrong on every occasion that I know of, had Joe Biden up by five points in Florida, and they were off by 8.4 points and I won Florida easily, easily. So they had me losing Florida by a lot and I ended up winning Florida by a lot. Other than that, they were very accurate. They had him up four points in Ohio and they were off by 12.2 points, and I also won Ohio, great state of Ohio very easily. And the Washington Post said, “Biden up 17 points in Wisconsin,” and it was basically even. They were off by about 17 points, and they knew that, they’re not stupid people. They knew that. Suppression. There are now only a few states yet to be decided in the presidential race. The voting apparatus of those states are run in all cases by Democrats. We were winning in all the key locations by a lot, actually, and then our numbers started miraculously getting whittled away in secret and they wouldn’t allow legally permissible observers. We went to court in a couple of instances and we were able to get the observers put in. And when the observers got there, they wanted them 60, 70 feet away, 80 feet, 100 feet away or outside the building to observe people inside the building. And we won a case, a big case, and we have others happening. There are lots of litigation, even beyond our litigation. There’s a tremendous amount of litigation generally because of how unfair this process was, and I predicted that. I’ve been talking about mail-in voting for a long time. It’s really destroyed our system. It’s a corrupt system and it makes people corrupt, even if they aren’t by nature, but they become corrupt. It’s too easy. They want to find out how many votes they need, and then they seem to be able to find them. They wait and wait, and then they find them, and you see that on Election Night. We were ahead in vote in North Carolina by a lot, a tremendous number of votes, and we’re still ahead by a lot, but not as many because they’re finding ballots all of a sudden. “Oh, we have some mail-in ballots.” It’s amazing how those mail-in ballots are so one-sided too. I know that it’s supposed to be to the advantage of the Democrats, but in all cases they’re so one-sided. We were up by nearly 700,000 votes in Pennsylvania. I won Pennsylvania by a lot. And that gets whittled down to, I think they said now we’re up by 90,000 votes and they’ll keep coming and coming and coming. They find them all over and they don’t want us to have any observers. Although we won a court case, the judge said, “You have to have observers.” Likewise in Georgia … And they’re appealing, actually they’re appealing. We want a case that we want people to watch and we want to observers and they’re actually appealing, which is sort of interesting. I wonder why they’d appeal? All we want to do is have people watch as they do the vote tabulations. Likewise in Georgia, I won by a lot, a lot, with a lead of over getting close to 300,000 votes on Election Night in Georgia. And by the way, got whittled down and now it’s getting to be to a point where I’ll go from winning by a lot to perhaps being even down a little bit. In Georgia, a pipe burst in a far away location, totally unrelated to the location of what was happening and they stopped counting for four hours. And a lot of things happened. The election apparatus in Georgia is run by Democrats. We also had margins of 300,000 in Michigan. We were way up in Michigan, won the state. And in Wisconsin, we did likewise fantastically well, and that got whittled down. In every case, they got whittled down. Today, we’re on track to win Arizona. We only need to carry, I guess, 55% of the remaining vote, 55% margins, and that’s a margin that we’ve significantly exceeded. So we’ll see what happens with that, but we’re on track to do okay in Arizona. Our goal is to defend the integrity of the election. We’ll not allow the corruption to steal such an important election, or any election for that manner. And we can’t allow silence, anybody to silence our voters and manufacture results. I’ve never had, I’ve been doing a lot of public things for a long time, I’ve never had anything that’s been as inspirational by people calling, talking, sending things to us. I’ve never seen such love and such affection and such spirit as I’ve seen for this. People know what’s happening and they see what’s happening and just before their eyes, and there are many instances which will be reported very shortly. There’s tremendous litigation going on, and this is a case where they’re trying to steal an election. They’re trying to rig an election and we can’t let that happen. Detroit and Philadelphia, known as two of the most corrupt political places anywhere in our country easily, cannot be responsible for engineering the outcome of a presidential race, a very important presidential race. In Pennsylvania, Democrats have gone to the State Supreme Court to try and ban our election observers and very strongly. Now we won the case, but they’re going forward. They don’t want anybody in there. They don’t want anybody watching them as they count the ballots, and I can’t imagine why. There’s absolutely no legitimate reason why they would not want to have people watching this process, because if it’s straight, they should be proud of it. Instead, they’re trying obviously to commit fraud. There’s no question about that. In Philadelphia, observers have been kept far away, very far away. So far that people are using binoculars to try and see, and there’s been tremendous problems caused. They put a paper on all of the windows so you can’t see in, and the people that are banned are very unhappy and become somewhat violent. The Eleventh Circuit ruled that in Georgia, the votes have been in by Election Day, that they should be in by Election Day, and they weren’t. Votes are coming in after Election Day. And they had a ruling already that you have to have the votes in by Election Day. To the best of my knowledge, votes should be in by Election Day, and they didn’t do that. Democrat officials never believed they could win this election honestly, I really believe that. That’s why they did the mail-in ballots, where there’s tremendous corruption and fraud going on. That’s why they mailed out tens of millions of unsolicited ballots without any verification measures whatsoever, and I’ve told everybody that these things would happen because I’ve seen it happen. I watched a lot of different elections before they decided to go with this big, massive election with tens of millions of ballots going out to everybody. In many cases, totally unsolicited. This was unprecedented in American history. This was by design. Despite years of claiming to care about the election security, they refuse to include any requirement to verify signatures, identities, or even determined whether they’re eligible or ineligible to vote. People are walking in there, they have no idea. They just take in the numbers. They’re writing down things, the workers, and doing a lot of bad things. And we have a lot of information coming and litigation that you’ll see that will shake even you people up, and you’ve seen it all. The officials overseeing the counting in Pennsylvania and other key states are all part of a corrupt Democrat machine that you’ve written about. And for a long time, you’ve been writing about the corrupt Democrat machine. I went to school there and I know a lot about it. It hasn’t changed since a long time ago and hasn’t changed. It has gotten worse. In Pennsylvania, partisan Democrats have allowed ballots in the state to be received three days after the election, and we think much more than that, and they’re counting those without even postmarks or any identification whatsoever. So you don’t have postmarks, you don’t have identification. There have been a number of disturbing irregularities across the nation. Our campaign has been denied access to observe any counting in Detroit. Detroit is another place, and I wouldn’t say has the best reputation for election integrity. Poll workers in Michigan were duplicating ballots. But when our observers attempted to challenge the activity, those poll workers jumped in front of the volunteers to block their views so that they couldn’t see what they were doing and it became a little bit dangerous. One major hub for counting ballots in Detroit covered up the windows again with large pieces of cardboard, and so they wanted to protect and block the counting area. They didn’t want anybody seeing the counting, even though these were observers who were legal observers that were supposed to be there. In Detroit, there were hours of unexplained delay in delivering many of the votes for counting. The final batch did not arrive until 4:00 in the morning. And even though the polls closed at 8:00 o’clock, so they brought it in and the batches came in and nobody knew where they came from. We’ve also been denied access to observe in critical places in Georgia. In multiple swing states, counting was halted for hours and hours on Election Night. With results withheld from major Democrat run locations only to appear later, and they certainly appeared and they all had the name Biden on them, or just about all. I think almost all. They all had the name Biden on them, which is a little strange. I challenge Joe and every Democrat to clarify that they only want legal votes because they talk about votes and I think they should use the word legal, legal votes. We want every legal vote counted, and I want every legal vote counted. We want openness and transparency, no secret count rooms, no mystery ballots, no illegal votes being cast after Election Day. You have Election Day and the laws are very strong on that. You have an Election Day and they don’t want votes cast after Election Day and they want the process to be an honest one. It’s so important. We want an honest election and we want an honest count and we want honest people working back there because it’s a very important job. So that’s the way this country is going to win. That’s the way the United States will win, and we think we will win the election very easily. We think there’s going to be a lot of litigation because we have so much evidence, so much proof, and it’s going to end up perhaps at the highest court in the land, we’ll see. But we think there’ll be a lot of litigation because we can’t have an election stolen by like this. And I tell you, He trum Small elections were a disaster. Small, very easy to handle elections were disastrous. This is a large scale version, and it’s getting worse and worse every day. We’re hearing stories that are horror stories, absolute horror stories, and we can’t let that happen to the United States of America. It’s not a question of who wins, Republican, Democrat, Joe, myself. We can’t let that happen to our country. We can’t be disgraced by having something like this happen. So it will be hopefully cleared up. Maybe soon, I hope soon, but it’ll probably go through a process, a legal process. And as you know, I’ve claimed certain states and he’s claiming states and we can both claim the States, but ultimately I have a feeling judges are going to have to rule. But there’s been a lot of shenanigans and we can’t stand for that in our country. Thank you very much.

"108","11-13-20","Thank you very much. Thank you. Beautiful out here this time of year. The past nine months, my administration has initiated the single greatest mobilization in U.S. history, pioneering, developing, and manufacturing therapies and vaccines in record time, numbers like nobody’s seen before. No medical breakthrough of this scope and magnitude has ever been achieved this rapidly, this quickly and we’re very proud of it and had tremendous help from the military, generals, admirals, and many of the great people at the White House. Operation Warp Speed is unequaled and unrivaled anywhere in the world and leaders of other countries have called me to congratulate us on what we’ve been able to do and we’ve helped many countries with their ventilators and all of the problems they were having, and I’d like to congratulate everyone involved in this effort. It’s been an incredible effort. As a result of Operation Warp Speed. Pfizer announced on Monday that it’s China virus vaccine is more than 90% effective. This far exceeds any and all expectations. Nobody thought they’d get to that level, and we have others coming, which we think will be at equal level, maybe more if that’s possible. In July, my administration reached an agreement with Pfizer to provide $1.95 billion to support the mass manufacturing and distribution of 100 million doses, with the option to purchase a total of 600 million doses shortly thereafter. Our investment will make it possible for the vaccine to be provided by Pfizer free of charge. Pfizer said wasn’t part of Warp Speed, but that turned out to be a unfortunate misrepresentation. They are part, that’s why we gave them the $1.95 billion and it was an unfortunate mistake that they made when they said that. We will work to secure an emergency use authorization, which should be coming down extremely soon and my administration will then coordinate the distribution of the vaccine and it will be approved. I think again, it will be approved very, very quickly, we hope. The average development timeline for the vaccine, including clinical tests and manufacturing can take eight to twelve years. Through Operation Warp Speed, we’re doing it in less than one year. If you had a different administration with different people, what we’ve done would have taken, in my opinion, three, four or five years, and it would have been in the FDA forever. This is five times faster than the fastest prior vaccine development in history. Five times faster. Say it again. Five times faster. Nobody can believe it, actually. Three other vaccines are also in the final stages of trial. They’ll arrive within a few weeks and they will also be mass-produced and the delivery will be very rapid. We’re ready to go. The vaccine will be distributed to frontline workers, the elderly and high-risk Americans immediately. It will be a matter of weeks. Get out very, very much ahead of schedule. Any schedule that I said, we’re going to be far ahead of that. We know that this virus primarily targets older populations and those with underlying health conditions, while over 99.98% of those under the age of 50 make a full and quick recovery, by giving the vaccine to high risk individuals right away will dramatically reduce hospitalizations and deaths. Case levels are high, but a lot of the case levels are high because of the fact that we have the best testing program anywhere in the world. We’ve developed the most and the best tests and we test far more than any other country so it shows, obviously, more cases. By vaccinating the elderly and the high risk, we will effectively end this phase of the pandemic and allow seniors to reclaim their golden years, the golden years of their lives, which is so incredible, and it’s about time that they can have those golden years. Again, this process is starting right away. Millions of doses will soon be going out the door. They’re all ready, waiting for that final approval. As soon as April, the vaccine will be available to the entire general population with the exception of places like New York State, where, for political reasons, the governor decided to say, and you know, I don’t think it’s good politically, I think it’s very bad from a health standpoint, but he wants to take his time with the vaccine. He doesn’t trust where the vaccine’s coming from. These are coming from the greatest companies anywhere in the world, greatest labs in the world, but he doesn’t trust the fact that it’s this White House, this administration, so we won’t be delivering it to New York until we have authorization to do so and that pains me to say that. This is a very successful, amazing vaccine at 90% and more, but the governor, Governor Cuomo, will have to let us know when he’s ready for it, otherwise we, can’t be delivering it to a state that won’t be giving it to its people immediately. And I know the people of New York very well. I know they want it. So the governor will let us know when he’s ready. He’s had some very bad editorials recently about this statement and what’s happened with respect to nursing homes and his handling of nursing homes and I hope he doesn’t handle this as badly as he’s handled the nursing homes, but we’re ready to provide it as soon as they let us know that they’ll actually use it. And again, it’s a very safe and a great vaccine. Already, we have among the lowest case, fatality rates, our country, anywhere in the world, the entire world. And we’ve performed significantly better than our peer countries. As far as therapeutics are concerned, my administration’s also made critical investments in therapies that have helped reduce the mortality rate by 85%. That’s, to me, one of the most exciting things. It’s incredible some of the antibody vaccines and others that have come out and have really helped people. 85%. Last month, the FDA approved remdesivir and we’ve secured enough remdesivir to treat 850,000 patients. My administration finalized an agreement with Eli Lilly to purchase the first doses of their antibody therapy, which shows amazing results. This treatment will be available completely free of cost to patients. 5,000 units have already been shipped and many more going out the door as we speak. We’re also reached an agreement with AstraZeneca for the large scale manufacturing of their antibody treatment, which is excellent. We expect to issue emergency use authorizations for a number of additional treatments in the near future. Tremendous promise. But remember the 85% number, that’s an incredible number. But we have some tremendously promising drugs online and ready to come out. We have ensured that our frontline workers have all the tools they need. My administration’s invoked the Defense Production Act and related authorities over 100 times and have made a historic investment into our industrial base. All states that requested PPE from the federal government have received the PPE almost immediately upon request. Every American who needed a ventilator has had access to a ventilator. Think of that. Very complicated piece of equipment, very expensive. And we haven’t had one person in this whole country that has requested or needed a ventilator that hasn’t had it. Every single request has been immediately filled. So that was something, that was a great job. And now we’re helping the rest of the world with ventilators because it’s a very hard thing. We’re producing them, thousands of ventilators a month. The federal government has 22, 000 beds immediately available for states and jurisdictions that need additional capacity. But we think that it’s going to start going down possibly very quickly. We’ll see what happens. But with the vaccine, you’ll see numbers going down within a matter of months and they’ll go down very rapidly. As we continue to combat the virus, our economy is rebounding far beyond any expectations. I see the stock market’s up almost 400 points today again and it’s ready to break the all time record. Our jobs records are incredible. The job numbers are incredible. In the last six months, we’ve created over 13 million jobs and slashed the unemployment rate by more than half. The last quarter we witnessed the fastest economic growth ever recorded in the history of our country. 33.1%. It’s a number that is more than double our highest. That was in 1952. And we’ve more than doubled. The United States experienced the smallest economic contraction and the most rapid economic recovery of any major Western nation. We went down less and we went up more, which is quite a combination of facts. While healthy Americans have gone back to work and to school, we continue to spare no expense to protect the elderly and the vulnerable. According to some estimates, a national lockdown costs $50 billion a day and hundreds of thousands of jobs every single day. Ideally, we won’t go to a lockdown. I will not go. This administration will not be going to a lockdown. Hopefully, whatever happens in the future, who knows which administration it will be. I guess time will tell, but I can tell you, this administration will not go to a lockdown. They won’t be a necessity. Lockdowns cost lives, and they cost a lot of problems. The cure can not be, you got to remember, can not be worse than the problem itself. And I’ve said it many times. And when you look at what happens during a lockdown, I just say it very loudly. It’s horrible what happens with drugs, alcohol, depression, loss of jobs, business closures. It’s a terrible thing. So this administration, under any circumstances, will not go to a lockdown, but we’ll be very vigilant, very careful. We understand the disease. It’s a complicated disease, but we understand it very well. We ask all Americans to remain vigilant especially as the weather gets cold and it becomes more difficult to go outside and to have outside gatherings. And with that, I just want to ask some very talented people to come up and say a few words. General Perna and Dr. Slaoui have been incredible. The general is really getting started right now, but he’s really… What we don’t know and what people don’t know, he started putting this all together six months ago and you’re going to see some real action. So general, maybe you’ll start it off and then doctor you’ll go right after that. Thank you very much. And then we’re going to finish it off with Mike Pence. Thank you. Please. Thank you. Sure. Mr. President, thank you for allowing me to continue service of our great nation as the co-leader with Dr. Moncef Slaoui on this mission. Let me start by emphasizing for me what is Operational Work Speed about? It is about saving lives and it is a herculean task that the president put us on many months ago. And as Dr. Slaoui just laid out, we are making steady progress and we are ready to execute. Through the whole of American approach, we have leveraged the best of nation in federal government, local, states, industry and academia to expand the capacity and capability to achieve our mission. It is been powerful. We have capitalized on the best contracting logistics and planning experts available to synchronize and integrate all phases of the operation from development of the vaccine, manufacturing of the vaccine, and finally, distribution of the vaccine. Six months ago, the capacity did not exist in our nation’s pharmaceutical production base. We went to work building brick and mortar manufacturing facilities, bringing in the right specialized machinery and equipment and prioritizing supply chain materials through the Defense Production Ac. Today, we expect to have tens of millions of doses immediately following EUA. And we will distribute them as soon as the FDA applies the EUA. We will do that within 24 hours of the EUA. We are harnessing the strength of commercial industry and the existing vaccine delivery capabilities and infrastructure. Our nation deserves this. Vaccines will be allocated pro rata by population so that we ensure a fair and equitable across. We need the States who are part of the planning to accept the vaccine. We are working closely along with the CDC, the 64 jurisdictions and states, to ensure vaccine can safely and quickly get to those who need it first. And then we have plans to ensure that it spreads exponentially across our country. And that no place is left without a vaccine. At the end of the day, our success is going to be judged by the availability of the vaccine as shots go in arms. It is the partnerships we have formed with the pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer and Madonna, distribution companies like McKesson, FedEx, and UPS, and pharmacies like CVS and Walgreens that have agreed to do things differently, to think how can we get this to the American people in the most rapid and expeditious way. We will be successful because of this All-of-America approach, this collaboration, this effort that everybody is leading towards. I will end where I started. This is about saving lives, the lives of the great American people. And we will not rest until we are successful and that we have irreversible momentum to returning our nation back to normal. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, General very much. Great job. Alex, please. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Thank you. Mike Pence, please. Thank you very much, Mike. And thank you, everybody. Thank you very much.

"109","11-20-20","Thank you very much. This is a very big announcement. The biggest ever concerning drugs and drug pricing. So today, I have to tell you it’s a great honor for me to announce that my administration is issuing two groundbreaking rules to very dramatically lower the price of prescription drugs for the American people. Especially for our cherish seniors. We’re pleased to be joined on this occasion by Secretary of Health and Human Services, Alex Azar, an administrator of Center for Medicare, Medicaid Services, Seema Verma. Thank you both. Thank you both. And thank you all for being here. Appreciate it. The unprecedented reforms we’re completing today are the direct result of the historic drug pricing executive orders I signed in July. Statutorily, we had to go through a very long process, and we got it done. I was very proud to have gotten this done. We were pushing it very hard, as we did with the vaccines and other things. The first action will save American seniors billions of dollars by preventing middlemen, famous middleman they call them, from ripping off Medicare patients with high prescription prices. Currently, drug companies provide large discounts on the price of prescription medicines, including nearly $40 billion in rebates to Medicare part D plans last year alone. Yet often, middlemen stop those discounts from going to the patients, which is what we’re interested in and not the middlemen, who need it the most. So the patients are going to be now getting the benefit, instead of these very wealthy individuals. Patients pay very high prices. And they have for many years, although we brought it down. Now, first time in 51 years with the cost adding up to hundreds or even thousands of dollars per year per patient. Today’s action ends this injustice and requires that these discounts go directly to people. These are the people that need it. This will save patients up to 30%, could be 40%, could be 50%, could be much higher than that. These are numbers that nobody’s ever even contemplated. And that doesn’t include life-saving drugs like insulin, which will be even higher. Insulin was destroying lives and destroying families because the cost was so high. And now, it’s at a level that nobody can even believe. Is that correct, Seema? $35 a month from many times that number. The second rule, we’re finalizing today will transform the way the US government pays for drugs to end global freeloading on the backs of American citizens and American patients. Until now, Americans have often been charged more than twice as much for the exact same drugs as other medically advanced countries. We would be having a drug, identical drug, same company, and we’d pay many times the price of what that drug would sell for in certain countries. In case after case, our citizens pay massively higher prices and other nations pay for the same exact pill from the same factory. Effectively, subsidizing socialism abroad with skyrocketing prices at home. So we would spend tremendous amounts of money in order to provide inexpensive drugs to another country. And when I say the price is different, you can see some examples where the price is beyond anything, four times, five times different. For example, Medicare part B recipients are forced to spend five times more for a common breast cancer medication than patients in other countries, so five times more. And we have other examples that are substantially higher than that. To address this unfairness and to lower prices for Americans, we’re finalizing the Most Favored Nation Rule. Remember that name, Most Favored Nation Rule. Nobody’s ever done this. The drug companies don’t like me too much, but we had to do it. It took it a long time before we were able to do this because statutorily, we had to go through a process. But there will never be anything like this. I just hope they keep it. I hope they have the courage to keep it because the powerful drug lobby, big pharma is putting pressure on people, like you wouldn’t believe. Medicare will now look at the price that other developed nations pay for their drugs. And instead of paying the highest price on the list, and we are substantially higher than any other country in the world, we will pay the lowest price. In other words, we take the lowest price and we match whatever the lowest price is. Leading to colossal savings for all Americans. And we’re talking about savings of 50, 60, 70%, 80%, different drugs, different prices. In addition, today, we’re taking one more historic action to hold down drug prices. In the past, drug companies have been allowed to identify certain very old generic drugs, that have been widely available for decades and exploited a misguided program called Unapproved Drugs Initiative. That’s Unapproved Drugs Initiative, a program that has been around for a long time, and hasn’t been too good the people that were supposed to benefit. To obtain market exclusivity on these medicines, so we are doing something that nobody thought anybody would do. The savings is going to be incredible. Then they’ve jacked up the prices by as much as 1000 to 5000% on this product. This program has also caused shortages of important medicines. Today, I’m announcing that we are ending the Unapproved Drugs Initiative program to stop this unfair practice. So prices are lifted by 1000% to 5000%. In one or two cases, even more than that. And we’re ending this, we are putting an end to it. Together these reforms will save American patients, many, many billions of dollars every single year. For generations, the American people have been abused by big pharma and their army of lawyers, lobbyists, and bought and paid for politicians. But I’ve been loyal to the special interests. I’ve been loyal to our patients and our people that need drugs, prescription drugs, and devoted myself to completely fighting for the American people. You’ll see that this is not an easy thing to do. Big pharma ran millions of dollars of negative advertisements against me during the campaign, which I won, by the way. But we’ll find that out. Almost 74 million votes. We had big pharma against us. We had the media against us. We had big tech against us. We had a lot of dishonesty against us. But big pharma alone ran millions and millions of dollars in ads. In fact, I looked at it and I said, who is it? I’ve never seen anything quite like it. Because I told them I’m going to have to do this. I was put here to do it job. And Pfizer and others were way ahead on vaccines. You wouldn’t have a vaccine, if it weren’t for me for another four years. Because FDA would have never been able to do what they did, what I forced them to do. And Pfizer and others even decided to not assess the results of their vaccine. In other words, not come out with a vaccine until just after the election. That’s because of what I did with favorite nations and these other elements. Instead of their original plan to assess the data in October. So they were going to come out in October. But they decided to delay it because of what I’m doing, which is fine with me because frankly, this is just a very big thing, a very big thing. What I’m doing here. I don’t know if anyone’s going to appreciate it. These people can’t even believe it, Alex, even you can’t believe it. Can you? Look at you. So they waited and waited and waited, and they thought they could come out with it a few days after the election. And it would have probably had an impact. Who knows? Maybe it wouldn’t have. I’m sure they would’ve found the ballot someplace, the Democrats and the group. These corrupt games will not deter us from doing what is right for the American people. And I will always put American patients first. And I think it can never be shown better than what I’m doing today. Already, we successfully lowered drug prices for the first time in 51 years. In September, we finalized a rule allowing states, wholesalers, and pharmacies to safely and legally import drugs from Canada. Career politicians have promised to institute this reform for decades. But we got it done. The reason Canada… And this is going to be, I think, just a short term fix because until we have the Favored Nations fully ready, which we hope to be in January 1st… I think a very important thing to say January 1st, it’s right around the corner. But I’m giving governors the right to go to Canada because they’ll pay approximately 50% less for their drugs that they buy for their states. So the governors buying drugs for their states, go to Canada. They buy the drugs for very, very much less. And they’ll be able to pass that on to the people of Florida. Ron DeSantis was the first one to ask. But others are asking also. And it’s a great thing. You’ll save 50%. They’re going to buy a lot from Canada initially. And I think ultimately, they’ll be comparing prices. You’ll get the lowest price anywhere in the world. So you won’t need to buy from Canada. In a few weeks, my administration will also finalize rules requiring federally funded health centers to pass drug company discounts and insulin and EpiPens directly to patients. And the EpiPen prices come way down. We remember those horrible stories about EpiPen. Well, the price has now come way, way, way down. We kept insulin costs for many seniors at just $35 a month. As I said, saving them an average of nearly $500 to a thousand dollars a year, just on insulin, saving a thousand dollars a year on insulin. Since I took office, we’ve reduced Medicare part D premiums by 12%, putting nearly $2 billion back into seniors pockets. Now, 12% is great by any standard, but 12% is peanuts compared to what we’ve done with Favorite Nations. I think it’s probably the biggest story that we’ve ever had relative to drug prices. There’s never been anything like this. This is something that has been talked about for many years. But nobody had the courage to do it because of the power of big pharma. We ended the Gag clauses that prevented pharmacists from telling patients how to buy less expensive drugs. As you know, pharmacists could not talk to patients about how to buy drugs. How about that one? Think that’s right? And now they can and should. We approved a record number of affordable generic drugs for three years in a row. And we put a very heavy emphasis on generic drugs. And the pricing there has become very good, but that pricing will also go down very substantially. No administration has ever fought harder or achieved more for our patients and for our seniors, but for America, when you think of it, for America. Because other countries were paying a fraction of what we were paying. In some cases, a small fraction. The numbers were just staggering. The difference between going to… I won’t name nations, but I could name five of them, right off the top of my head. That it is so incredible to think about for years what was happening. We’ve been working on this for two years. Statutorily, we had to go through a process. But when you think that our nation for the exact same pill out of the exact same box, often made in the exact same factory, same company, and you take a look at the cost was so much more, many, many times more. In four short years, we’ve instituted the most dramatic series of drug pricing reforms in decades. And you’ll see that it all comes to fruition right now, starting in January 1st. And the American people benefit from our actions for many, many decades. And it should be very immediate. Now, I presume they’ll sue, but it’s a suit that they should never be able to win. They should never ever be able to win. So now, I’d like to ask Secretary Azar to provide some more details as to the action. And then, Seema, I’d like to have you come up and say a few words. And great job. We appreciate it. Thank you. Go ahead. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, [inaudible 00:23:43]. Take care. You did good Alex. Thank you everybody.

"110","11-24-20","Well, thank you very much please. I just want to congratulate everybody. The Dow Jones industrial average just broke for the first time in history, 30,000. That’s good. That’s great for jobs and it’s good for everything and this is the ninth time that we set a record during the course of 2020 and it’s the 48th time that we’ve set the record during the Trump administration and there’s never been anything like that. I just want to congratulate everybody that works so hard in the white house, but maybe most importantly, the people of our country. It’s a tremendous achievement. The first lady and I are thrilled to welcome you all to the beautiful rose garden where the first lady actually worked very hard on renovating it. It was 61 years. It was in rough shape. A very big job, actually. When you go to the wires underground, people have no idea how complex it is, but you’ve done a fantastic job. Thank you very much. We’re also very happy to have with us my daughter, Ivanka and Jared and Theodore, Arabella, Joseph, thank you very much for coming. They like the turkey. Thank you very much. On behalf of the entire Trump family, I want to wish every American a healthy and very happy Thanksgiving. We’re here today to continue a beloved annual tradition, the official presidential pardon of a very, very fortunate turkey because Thanksgiving is a special day for turkeys, I guess probably for the most part not a very good one, when you think about it. The first turkey to dodge the white house dinner table received unofficial clemency when president Abraham Lincoln’s son Tad begged his father to spare his new friend. For the past 73 years, the National Turkey Federation has presented the national thanksgiving turkey to the president starting under president George HW Bush. These birds have received a formal pardon every single year. Today is my honor to present to you this year’s lucky bird, Corn and just in case we needed him, Cob. Corn and Cob. That’s not too hard to remember is that. These two magnificent gobblers were selected from the official presidential flock of 30 turkeys, some real beauties. They were raised by the chairman of the National Turkey Federation himself, Ron Cardel. Ron, thank you very much, Ron. Please stand up. Great job. Ron, thank you for being here and your family. Beautiful family. Thank you very much for being here. Appreciate it. Like so many presidential flocks this one started in the great state of Iowa, in what can only be described as an act of blatant pandering and by the way, I love the state of Iowa. These two turkeys sought to win the support of Iowans across the state, by naming themselves Corn and Cob. After today’s ceremony, these birds will retire under the care of skilled veterinarians at Iowa State University, a tremendous university in Ames. Once there, people of all ages will be able to visit them and learn about poultry science, veterinary medicine and the noble American tradition of farming. We love our farmers I’ll tell you. We hope and we know that’s going to happen that Corn and Cob have a very long happy and memorable life. This year our nation commemorates the 400th anniversary of the pilgrims landing on Plymouth Rock. After arriving in the new world, the brave men and women of the Mayflower endured a bitter and dangerous winter, very, very dangerous winter. Many were sick, most were starving and all were praying for a miracle. Thankfully God heard their prayers. From our earliest days America has always been a story of perseverance and triumph, determination and strength, loyalty and faith. This week in a time that is very unusual, but in so many ways, very, very good, what we’ve endured and been able to endure with the vaccines now coming out one after another, it’s an incredible thing that happened. One of the greatest medical achievements that this planet has ever seen, but it’s time to remember that we live in a great, great country, the greatest of them all and there’s nothing even close as far as I’m concerned. Every American can be united in Thanksgiving to God for the incredible gifts he has bestowed upon us, the blessings of family, community and this exceptional beautiful and great country. It’s greater than ever before. During this Thanksgiving, we extend our eternal gratitude to the doctors, nurses, healthcare workers and scientists who have waged the battle against the China virus and we give thanks for the vaccines and therapies that will soon end the pandemic. It’s just such a tremendous feeling to know that they’re coming and they’ll be coming probably starting next week or shortly thereafter. We send our love to every member of the armed forces and the law enforcement heroes risking their lives to keep America safe, to keep America great and as I say, America first. Shouldn’t go away from that. America first. We give thanks to the priceless freedoms that we’ve inherited and we ask God to watch over and protect our nation and its people during this incredible holiday and in all of the years to come, we ask that of God. Once again, Melania and I wish to thank everybody for your incredible courtesies and also wish you a happy Thanksgiving and now it’s time for the moment of our guests of honor. They’ve been waiting and in this case, he’s been waiting for this and bring him out. Look at that beautiful, beautiful bird. Oh, so lucky. That is a lucky bird. Corn, I hear by grant you a full pardon. Thank you Corn. Iowa farm. I knew I liked you. Happy Thanksgiving to everybody. Thank you very much. Thank you everybody.

"111","11-25-20","Thank you very much. I’ve been watching the hearing on OAN and saw it on a couple of other great networks, but I really appreciate being asked to speak. I’m in the Oval Office right now, and it’s very interesting to see what’s going on. This was an election that we won easily. We won it by a lot. Big energy. An official was on this morning on a important show and said, “There’s no way Trump didn’t win Pennsylvania, because the energy industry was all for him. I saw with my eyes what happened,” and he told me horror stories, absolute horror stories. So this was, very sad to say it, this election was rigged and we can’t let that happen. We can’t let it happen for our country. And this election has to be turned around, because we won Pennsylvania by a lot. And we won all of these swing States by a lot. Anybody watching television the night of the election was saying, “Wow.” I was called by the biggest political people. Congratulations, sir, on a big win. And all of a sudden ballots were dumped all over the place, and a lot of horrible things happened and everybody in that room, I want to thank all of the people that signed affidavits and all of the speakers. You fantastic people. You’re great Patriots. I want to thank the senators for being there. And it’s so important, day before Thanksgiving, it really represents somebody. Between the voter suppression and all of the horrible things that happened to poll watchers. We have poll watcher affidavits piled up to the ceiling. They’re all over. They were treated horribly all over, all of these swing States, I mean virtually all of the swing States, and many other things were happening that were horrible, just horrible. But the poll watchers weren’t allowed to watch. They were in many cases, whisked out of the room. Not only into pens that were 20, 30, 40, 60, 100 feet away where you couldn’t even see. They were using binoculars. People are reporting that they had to use binoculars, and that didn’t work. If you were a Republican poll watcher, you were treated like a dog and the Democrats had no problem, but they were rough. They were literally pushed out, and it was rough tactics. This is what happened here. This is not the United States of America what happened, and I think everybody knows that. That’s why you’re there, and that’s why you’re so vehement about it. We have many, many cases, many, many cases of people walking in, an elderly woman walks in looking forward to voting November 3rd and says, “Oh good. Where would I go about voting?” “I’m sorry. You’ve already voted. Your ballot is in.” They said, “No, I didn’t vote. I didn’t vote.” “No, your ballot is in. You’ve already voted.” In all cases for Biden, by the way. She said, “No, no, I want to vote.” Nope, your ballot is in.” And then they give her a provisional ballot to sign, which goes nowhere. It’s a disgrace that this is happening to our country. We won this election by a lot. We got 74 million votes. And if you would have said 74 million votes the day before the election, every single professional in the business would have said, there’s no way of beating that. We got 11 million votes more than we had four years before in 2016, and we got many votes more than Ronald Reagan had when he won 49 States, that nobody would’ve said we even had a chance of losing. And all you had to do is take a look at the numbers at 10 o’clock in the evening when everybody thought the election was virtually over, and then very weird things happened. But they’re not weird to professionals, and they’re not weird to Dominion and other people that operate machines. And they’re not weird to the people that handle the ballots where they were flooding the market. People were getting two and three and four ballots in their home. People that were dead were signing up for ballots. Not only were they coming in and putting in a ballot, but dead people were requesting ballots and they were dead for years, and they were requesting ballots. The whole world is watching us. The whole world is watching the United States of America and we can’t let them get away with it. And we have judges that are afraid to make a decision. We have judges that don’t want to do the same thing. A very good lawyer said, “Well, sir, I mean, that’s a big statement for a judge to overthrow an election.” I said, “Really? If he got hundreds of thousands of votes more than he was entitled to get through all of the things that I’m listening to right now, and you’re just covering a few of them, we have hundreds and hundreds of affidavits of stories that are even worse than the stories I’m hearing. Why wouldn’t they overturn an election?” Certainly overturn it in your state, because we have other States that are just as bad. If you look at Michigan with Detroit, you look at the things that happened in Detroit where you have a voter, but you have more votes than you have voters. You take a look at Detroit, Michigan, you have more votes than you have voters. Then you have two people that don’t want to certify. They don’t want to certify, and they’re harassed violently. And they turned off the cameras during the harassment for two hours. Then they said, “Wow.” And they were afraid and they voted. Then they went back to sign and they couldn’t do it because they said, “We can’t do it because this is corrupt. This is horrible what’s taken place.” Think of it, more votes than you have voters, but that was the least of it. They have things that were as bad as that. And this is going on all over, all over. We’re doing very well in a lot of States, a lot of good things are happening in Georgia. We’re getting little help from government, but a lot of good things happening in Georgia, Wisconsin, and Michigan. They’re seeing what happened in Detroit. And we sure are looking at what’s happening in Pennsylvania and Philadelphia. What happened in Philadelphia, they keep the poll watches not only in pens, but they keep them out of the building. And the only reason they got back into the building was they got a court order. Then the definition of back into the building was very far away where they couldn’t see anything. And they talk about closed circuit television, except you couldn’t see it because the picture was so unclear you didn’t even know what they were doing. They could have been playing a baseball game. So it’s a very sad thing for our country to have this. They have to turn over the results. It would be easy for me to say, “Oh, let’s worry about four years from now.” No, this election was lost by the Democrats. They cheated. It was a fraudulent election. They flooded the market. The defrauded everybody with ballots. I just want to thank everybody for being there. You’re doing a tremendous service. This is a very important moment in the history of our country, and you’re doing a tremendous service to our country, and don’t worry about bravery because the people that talk the most, they’re not the ones you have to worry about. And these are all talkers, they intimidate, but these are not people that you’re going to ultimately have to … They push you around. They pushed our poll workers out. Our poll watchers were pushed out of the building. Some got back in, they were put into pens, but these are not people …Don’t be intimidated by these people, but they’re bad people. They’re horrible people, and they’re people that don’t love our country. So we don’t have to worry about four years right now, we have to worry about what happened on November 3rd and previous to November 3rd. And by the way, after November 3rd, when people put votes in and they put them in illegally, they put them in after the polls closed. And one of our great Supreme Court Justices made mention of that. And I can’t imagine that any Justice or anybody looking at it could be thrilled when they vote after the election is over. So I want to thank everybody very much for being there. I want to thank the state Senate, respected people, tremendous people. And you’re doing a tremendous service for our country. If something was done wrong, if this election was won fraudulently, and that’s what happened, it was a fraud. And we’re talking about, very importantly, many more ballots, many more votes than the number we need. In other words, if we needed 50,000 votes, we’re not talking about we found nine dead people that voted. Of course, there were many more than that, numbers that nobody even believes. No, we’re talking about numbers that are far in excess of the 50,000. Far in excess in another state where we lost by 10,000, and they went absolutely wild because we got far more votes than they thought possible. And they’ve just stepped on the gas. And they got caught, just like they got caught spying on my campaign. They got caught exactly. They got caught doing this. So I really appreciate it. And the country appreciates it, and we have to turn the election over because there’s no doubt. We have all the evidence. We have all the affidavits. We have everything. All we need is to have some judge listen to it properly without having a political opinion or having another kind of a problem, because we have everything. And by the way, the evidence is pouring in now as we speak. And I want to thank Rudy Giuliani for having the courage to do this. There were a lot of lawyers that backed down because they were being screamed at. Rudy is the greatest Mayor in the history of New York, and there’s a reason. He’s got great courage and he doesn’t care. He wants to do what’s right. And I told him the other day, “Rudy, you were the greatest Mayor in the history of New York,” and you see what happened to New York without Rudy. “You were the greatest Mayor, but this is more important. What you are doing now is far more important than being a great Mayor of the city of New York and being its greatest Mayor by far.” By the way, by far. “This is going to be your crowning achievement, because you’re saving our country.” Thank you all very much. Thank you.

"112","11-26-20","Today I want to recognize Lieutenant Colonel Timothy Redhair and the United States Army 36th Infantry Division. Tremendous people. From your base in Kuwait, you support our fight against radical Islamic terrorism and help combat Iranian aggression. We salute you. Thank you very much. And you’ll say, perhaps, a few words in a little while. We appreciate it very much, Timothy. From the Marines, we have Special Purpose Marine Air-Ground Task Force based in Kuwait which conducts crisis response throughout the Middle-East. Colonel Andrew Priddy, your warriors bring the fight straight to the enemy so that American families can sleep soundly at home. We’ve been building up our military. We spent $2.5 trillion in the last three and a half years, and we’ve never had anything like it in terms of equipment and all of the elements that we put together. Space Force, we’re very proud of. Brand new. Nobody thought that could happen. So we spent 2.5.. Think of that, $2.5 trillion. All new tanks and missiles, and rockets and everything is tippy top. Nobody thought we could ever get there and we’ve done it quickly. Most of the equipment is there. Much of it is there. Most of it’s coming. The rest of it’s coming in over the next, I would say, six months to 12 months. All made in the USA, which is very good. But every American owes you a debt of thanks, and we appreciate it. Also with us are our men and women of the US Navy aboard the USS Winston Churchill. It’s a beauty led by commander Timothy Shanley. You’re deployed in the Red Sea where you deter terrorists, defend freedom of navigation and escort ships through the Strait of Hormuz. Your magnificent ship is a powerful symbol of peace through strength. And that’s what we have now is peace through strength. You look at what’s going on, no wars. They’re saying, “Wow, the president. Four years, no wars.” We stopped the wars and we won, as you know, 100% of the ISIS caliphate in Syria, Iraq. We’ve done a job. Welcome as well to everyone at Ali Al Salaam Airbase in Kuwait, including major Tommy Rutherford and the 386 expeditionary logistics readiness squadron. Thank you very much, Tommy. Your mission to support our soldiers on the ground and deliver precious cargo where it needs to go, including transporting 18 tons of medical equipment during the China virus pandemic. Keep up the outstanding work. Great job you’ve done. I hear all about it. Amazing work you do. From the United States Space… This is a very important thing to me, the Space Force, because it’s 75 years since the Air Force. This is the first one, new branch. The United States Space Force. We’re joined by Lieutenant Colonel Matthew Lomeyer and the 11th Space Warning Squadron… That sounds great, at Buckley Air Force Base in Colorado. You keep watch around the world to detect missile launches, space launches, and nuclear detonations while providing critical intelligence. All of you are pioneers in the newest branch of our armed forces. And again, it’s very special to me, that new branch, because that was something I felt was necessary. And I never said it during a campaign, I said it after I became president. I saw what was happening with China and Russia and others. And it’s really something, so we’re very proud of it. Finally, we have with us members of the US Coast Guard Port Security Unit 308 under Captain General Rocco [inaudible 00:03:59]. You’re joined with us from Guantanamo Bay where you secure our coastal waters, combat drug traffickers, escort vessels, and protect our forces in the region. On American shores and beyond, the Coast Guard has always made America proud. I want to tell you, I was here two years ago in Texas. You saved thousands and thousands of people. That was incredible. The job the Coast Guard has done. And now we have all new ships coming to the Coast Guard. You had old ships, and they were as good as they could be but they were very old. And now you have brand new Coast Guard ships, and it’s my honor to have gotten them for you. Today I send you the love, gratitude, respect, and prayers of our entire nation. Once again, I wish you a very happy Thanksgiving. You’re doing an incredible job and your country is doing well. We just set a record in the stock market, over 30,000 in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Over 30,000, think of that. Nobody ever thought we were going to hit that during a pandemic. The whole world is suffering this tremendous pandemic, not just us. The world. And you wouldn’t know that to listen to the news reports, but the whole world is suffering and we are rounding the curve. The vaccines are being delivered, literally it’ll start next week and the week after. And it’ll hit the frontline workers and seniors and doctors, nurses. A lot of people are going to start, and we’re going very quickly. Two companies already announced. A third one coming up, and a fourth and fifth one coming up soon also. Some people have called it a medical, really, a miracle. Could’ve taken four or five years to do this. Normally it probably would’ve taken four or five years just getting it through the FDA. We pushed it very hard. But I want to thank you all. I want to wish you a happy Thanksgiving. And let’s… Maybe if could start. Anybody would like to raise their hand. Go ahead. We’ll start with you. Thank you very much. Yes, go ahead. Please. That’s fantastic. And how is Kuwait doing? That’s great. Well you’re doing a fantastic job and we appreciate it. Thank you very much, Colonel. Tremendous to be with you. Happy Thanksgiving. Say hello and a happy Thanksgiving to everybody, and we’ll see you soon. Thank you for the job you do. Appreciate it. Thank you. Colonel, go ahead please. Marine Corps. Thank you. Andrew, go ahead, please, if you’re ready. Does he hear me? Maybe not. Oh, there he is. Is that Andrew? Marine Corps. Sergeant, go ahead, please. Thank you very much. Great job. We appreciate it very much. Well, thank you very much, and good luck with everything. Happy Thanksgiving to everybody, please. Thank you. Thank you very much. The Navy. Tim, go ahead. Well, I want to thank you very much. Is that the engines I hear behind you? That sounds like a powerful group. It sounds like waves crashing into the ship but it’s a beautiful sound. That’s a beautiful sound. Are you enjoying what you’re doing, Tim? Yeah, that’s great. And your equipment is getting newer and newer, better and better. We’re building a lot of ships right now, as you know, and you’ll have them very soon. And I just want to congratulate you. Everybody, but I want to congratulate you. Great job with the Navy. We appreciate it very much, Tim. Thank you. So the Air Force? We’ll do the Air Force, please. Please. Tommy. Hi. Well, I appreciate it. I love doing it, actually, and I’m very proud of it because we’ve spent so much. When we took over, our military was very depleted. You know that very well. You know it probably better than most with the Air Force because the planes were old. They were tired and now you have all brand-new F35s coming and others. And your tanks, your bombers, the whole thing, they’re all coming. Hopefully we never have to use it for war, but we’re pretty prepared than we ever have been. When I came in four years ago, hard to believe almost four years ago, we were in sad shape and now we’re in phenomenal shape. Have you seen the difference in the equipment over the last couple of years? We went from old planes to brand new planes, from planes that were very visible to stealth where you can’t see them. Stealth helps, do you agree with that? I don’t know much about what you do but I know if you can’t see it, I like it better. Anyway, thank you very much, and Tommy, thank you for doing a great job. We appreciate it very much. Thank you. So now we’re going to a special place in my heart, Space Force, because nobody even thought about Space Force and I looked at it, and I said, “We’re going to have to come up… we’re going to have to do something because I look at what China was doing, and Russia was doing, others are thinking about doing,” and I want to just thank you very much. Is Matt there, Matt? Thank you very much, and you too. And I know the coordination with you and Air Force has been stellar. You’re getting along great and you’re doing well together, and it really does work well together. But I thought that you should have separate… and as years go by, and as decades go by, people will see the importance of Space Force, there’s no question about it. So thank you very much, I appreciate it. And Coast Guard, please. Straight, that’s right, thank you very much. That’s great, that’s really good. Are you a golfer? Do you play golf? You love it, right? It’s pretty good, thank you very much. It’s the only form of exercise. Thank you very much, I appreciate it, and really, everybody, just congratulations. I have to say, on the Army, we just made a tremendous purchase of equipment, as you know. I think Tim probably saw that and you have a lot of equipment coming in to the Army. In particular, we really went for top of the line, Tim. I guess you saw that and you see it pouring in, and that’s good. So it’s an honor. We want to thank you very much, Tim, and thank you. I will say this, the Coast Guard, nothing and no stock has gone up higher than Coast Guard, the stock in the Coast Guard, the reputation of the Coast Guard, the job you’ve done on the hurricanes. And I think people didn’t appreciate it as much as they do now, I can tell you that. It’s gone very high. What you’ve done in Texas and in Florida, in particular, in Puerto Rico, the job you did in Puerto Rico. And you go out there in those monster waves, as dangerous as can be, even with the new boats and the new ships, nothing’s meant for the kind of waves we saw, especially in Texas. You went out there, and you did your job, and you saved thousands of lives, as I said. I really am very proud of the Coast Guard, so I want to really call it out. Thank you very much, very proud of you, thank you. Thank you all, have a great Thanksgiving, and don’t eat too much turkey. Thank you, thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much, Happy Thanksgiving. Well, we don’t know what is last, if you look at what’s going on. You have to really take a look at what’s going on. They’re finding tremendous discrepancies in the votes. Nobody believes those numbers. Those numbers are incorrect numbers. A lot of numbers have already been reported that’s incorrect. You’re going to see things happening over the next week or two that are going to be shocking to people. If you look at the numbers in Michigan, if you look at the numbers in Pennsylvania, if you look at fraudulent voting and fraudulent votes, so I can’t say what’s first and what’s last in terms of is this the last one or is this the first one of a second term. We’ll see what happens. Nobody wants to see the kind of fraud that this election has really come to represent. We are looking at things that are so bad in Georgia, they don’t want to show us signatures. The reason they don’t want to show us signatures is very simple, because we will find thousands and thousands… it’s a very close race. It’s hair-thin. But we’ll find thousands and thousands of discrepancies, fraud. Why they aren’t wanting to show those signatures is amazing. They’re doing recounts, and even in the recount they found thousands of votes that were off. But now we want to look at the signatures, and you will find tens of thousands of false ballots, forged ballots. You’ll see it all over. You’re going to see a lot of it. And you go to Pennsylvania, you saw the meeting we had yesterday with Pennsylvania. You saw people come up, they went to vote, and they said, “No, you can’t vote. Somebody else already sent in a ballot, and a woman…” But this is happening tens of thousands of times. I think it was 600 and some-odd thousand, 687,000 fraudulent votes cast in Pennsylvania, and I will tell you, if you look at the state house now, the Republican state house, they’re starting to see what’s going on there. But they’ve really known it for a long time. Then you go to Michigan and you look at what happened in Wayne County and Detroit. I went through a list. I went almost every county and you see it, almost everybody, 78%, 72%, 68% going through the list. Then you get to Wayne, and something happened, tremendous numbers. You saw the canvassers that refused to sign their document because they said, “We can’t sign a fraudulent document.” Horrible things went on. That’s in Wayne County, Detroit. But you look at the votes that were just tabulated, and they were left today. Look at all the counties. I won almost all of them except Detroit was so egregious. It was phony.Look at what’s going on in Wisconsin. Wisconsin they’re finding tremendous discrepancy. You just take a look at that, tremendous discrepancy, and elsewhere. So we’re going to see what happens. But you can’t have somebody assume office and already they want to get rid of America First. I mean they want to get rid of America First. They don’t want America First. You know why? Because China doesn’t want it. China expressed their wish, “Please get rid of America First,” and the Biden administration said, “That’s okay, we’ll get rid of American First.” No, we don’t want to get rid of America First. We want to put America first, and other countries should put themselves first too, and I tell them that all the time. But we don’t want to get rid of it. So I don’t know what is going to happen. I know one thing, Joe Biden did not get 80 million votes, and I got 74 million. But there were many ballots thrown away, so I got much more than that. But I got 74 million. 74 million is 11 million more than I got last time. It’s millions more than Ronald Regan got when he won 49 states. I guess he won 49 states, yes, and it’s millions more than Hillary Clinton got. Joe Biden did not get… and by the way, Joe Biden did not beat Barack Obama with the Black vote, didn’t beat him. But they have him as beating him. And if you look at the numbers, the numbers are false. The numbers are corrupt. It was a rigged election, 100%, and people know it. That’s why you have people marching all over the United States right now. They know it was a rigged election and look at what’s happening in Georgia. A lot of things are being found in Georgia and they are absolutely against showing… I mean it’s a sad thing. They don’t want to show signatures. It can be solved if you show signatures. But you’re going to find out the people that signed aren’t the people that are supposed to be signing. You’re going to find that the people that signed those envelopes, they didn’t do the ballots, envelopes… and then somebody said, “Maybe the envelopes were thrown out.” There’s tremendous fraud here. If you look [crosstalk 00:23:28] wait, just one second. If you look at 10:00 in the evening, you saw what happened. Then you had these massive dumps. Nobody’s ever seen anything like it. You have Dominion, which is very, very suspect to start off with. Nobody knows the ownership. People say the votes are counted in foreign countries and much worse than that, by the way, with Dominion. So Dominion is also partially based in Canada, but it’s based in other countries too, and nobody knows where the votes… But you know, Canada refuses to use Dominion. Canada uses paper ballots. So think of it, they’re based in Canada, and Canada refuses to use them. They’re smart. They use paper ballots because paper ballots are, frankly, the only thing that really you’re going to get an accurate tab on because those machines are fixed, they’re rigged. You can press Trump and the vote goes to Biden. All you have to do is play with a chip, and it’s shown all the time. All you have to do is play with a chip, and they played with a chip, especially in Wayne County and Detroit. You take a look. In Philadelphia, you take a look. We’ve had excellent meetings with senators from Pennsylvania, Republican senators and others, and they’re seeing things. They knew it was dishonest, but they didn’t know it was this dishonest. You’ll see it all. You’ll see it also, so we’ll see. Speaking of Georgia, I’ll be going there. I spoke with the two great senators. They’re great senators, Kelly and David. I’ll probably be going on Saturday. We’re looking for a site. We’re going to have a tremendous turnout, and we seem to always have a good turnout. The people are very disappointed that we were robbed. We were robbed. I won that by hundreds of thousands of votes. Everybody knows it. You go down the streets, there are Trump/Pence signs all over the place. We won that by hundreds of thousands, Georgia, so they’re disappointed. I don’t want them to be disappointed. That’ll solve itself. We’re finding the votes. Once we get to the signatures, we’ll take over 100%. Once we get to signature, 100%. We will take over Georgia and we will get Georgia, but they have to show us the signatures. Stacey Abrams pulled the wool over the secretary of state. I don’t know who he is, but the secretary of state. It doesn’t matter. He says that, too, but I don’t know him. I never met him. I have no idea who he is. All I know is that’s the ultimate. “I donated to Trump. I respect Trump. I love Trump. I think Trump is great. By the way, we’re giving nothing.” This guy got played like I’ve never seen anybody played. Tell him, if he donated to Trump, if he likes Trump, let us see the signatures. Why is he not letting us see? There’s only one reason you can’t see the signatures. That’s because there’s fraud all over the place. Even without looking at signatures, as you know, we found thousands of wrong votes. By the way, always against me. It was not 50/50. It was always against me. The other thing, take a look at Michigan. Take a look at what they did with respect to counties, every county, 78%, 72%, 76%, 59%. The whole thing, one after another after another, and then you get to Detroit and it’s more votes than people. Dead people voting all over the place. But anyway, going back to Georgia just for a second. I’ll be going there on Saturday night, and maybe I’ll go twice. It’s very important that we win those races. These are two great people. I know them both very well. They’re both great people. I think the two people… I beat the one gentleman. He ran against a congressional candidate who was an excellent person, frankly, and he didn’t even live in the right community, and that’s how we won. Now I have to beat him again. He lost as a congressman. He was going for Congress, as you remember, and now against Karen. And now he’s running against David. He doesn’t deserve to be there. He’s a lightweight. The other one is either a communist or a socialist. I can’t figure that one out yet. But he’s either a communist or socialist, probably a communist. This is not for Georgia. I just want to tell my people, don’t be disappointed yet because this race is far from over. But I’m going on Saturday night. I’ll be in Georgia. We’re going to have a tremendous crowd. They’re looking for the right site. Probably, we’d love to take one of the big stadiums, but you can’t because of the COVID, so we’ll have an outdoor form of probably an airport. Most likely it’s an airport. They’re looking for the biggest space. We’ll have tens of thousands of people show up. I think it’s very important. Then, I may go a second time. Depending on how they’re doing, I may go a second time. But they’re two really good people. Yeah? Yeah, please, go ahead. It’s going to be a very hard thing to concede because we know there was massive fraud. As to whether or not I can get this apparatus moving this quickly, because time isn’t on our side, everything else is on our side. Facts are on our side. This was a massive fraud. This should never take place in this country. We’re like a third world country. We have machines that nobody knows what the hell they’re looking at. You take a look at all the mistakes they made. Look at even Georgia. Look at all the mistakes they made, and all that was is a simple you press a button. Look at Georgia. All the votes they found just by going… And I said they shouldn’t even do it because it doesn’t mean anything. They’re doing a recount right now in Georgia that is meaningless. The only recount that matters in Georgia is to look at the signatures on the envelope, and you will find that those signatures do not match the people that were, many of them, hundreds of thousands of them, hundreds of thousands, and I only lost by 12,000 votes. I didn’t lose. I don’t even like to say I lose. I guess we’re 11,000 or 12,000 votes short. That’s out of millions and millions of votes. They just got it over the line. One of the things that happened, I did so well, and I was told this in two other states, that they didn’t know what to do. They panicked. Take a look at their drops at 3:00 and 3:42 in the morning on certain states. They did drops where you’re going along like this, and then you’ll have a spike that goes up to the ceiling at that. It’s disgraceful. We can’t let that happen. I will tell you, in Philadelphia, the Republicans, State House Republicans are very, very upset, and it’s appropriate because Philadelphia’s become very activist, if you look at what’s going on. They don’t want that to happen to Pennsylvania, to the state of Pennsylvania. I don’t even like to use… It was a rigged election. If they do, they made a mistake, because this election was a fraud. Just saying, I said, this election was a fraud. They have Biden beating Obama, and Obama’s vote, in areas that mattered in terms of the election, in swing states, and yet he’s losing to Obama all over the place, but he’s beating Obama in swing states, which are the states that mattered for purposes of the election. No, I can’t say that at all. I think it’s a possibility. They’re trying to… Look, between you people-don’t talk to me that way. You’re just a lightweight. Don’t talk to me that way. I’m the President of the United States. Don’t ever talk to the president that way. All right, I’m going to go with another question. Go ahead. Certainly I will. Certainly I will, and you know that. But I think that there will be a lot of things happening between now and the 20th of January, a lot of things. Massive fraud has been found. We’re like a third world country. We’re using computer equipment that can be hacked. They talk about glitches. How many glitches did they find? A glitch, oh gee, we had a glitch, 5,000 votes. In all cases, right? In all cases, the votes went from Trump to Biden. They didn’t go from Biden. The glitches were never from Biden to Trump. They had many glitches, and they said, “Oh, we had a glitch.” A glitch is like the equipment is a little broken, we’ll fix it up. No, a glitch is, in this case, we caught them cheating, we caught them stealing, we caught a fraudulent effort to get votes, and they said, “Oh yes, it’s true, there was.” And there were many of them. But here’s the problem. There were probably 10, 20, 30 times that didn’t get caught. We just got lucky and caught numerous of them. What that is, is very simple. If you look at the glitch, the glitch means, “Oh, we got caught. We got caught with the votes and now let’s just call it a glitch.” It wasn’t the machinery. By the way, the machinery, if you look, just take a look anywhere on the internet, you will see many, many people where they’re experimenting with this stupid machinery, where if you set it a certain way, the votes go from Trump to Biden. If you look at these counties, if you look at Arizona where I was going to win very easily, I’ve had the biggest politicians in Arizona say, “There was no way you lost Arizona.” There’s no way I lost Pennsylvania, with his anti-fuel and with his anti-fracking and all of the things that they stand against. There was no way. Now, Texas, you all said that I was going to lose Texas by a lot, four points. I won Texas by eight or nine points. Right? I won it very easily. In Wisconsin, you all said I was going to lose, or the poll said, certain polls, Washington Post, ABC, said I was going to lose by 17 points. Think of how dishonest. I thought I was going to win it, and essentially I did win it. It’s very, very close. It’s very, very close. We’re going to win because they found, by the way, in Wisconsin, they have found massive discrepancy, just so you understand, massive discrepancy. But they said I was going to lose by 17 points and I won the state, but it’s very close. It shows very close, whether you say win or lose, it shows very close. When you look at the massive discrepancy that we’ll be revealing, that’s already been revealed, everybody knows it, they just don’t want to play it. Between big tech and the fake news media, you just put out like this little railroad trade. Now, I think it’s not right that he’s trying to pick a cabinet, but I can’t imagine whether it’s courts or legislatures. If you’re going to catch hundreds of thousands of false ballots, and I’m talking in each state. Just so you understand, many, many more votes that we’re talking about that we need, you understand, I’m not saying we caught 23 dead people, but we were short 20,000 votes. No, no. We have tens of thousands votes more than we need in all cases. Okay? In all cases. I think you’re going to see something. I think it’s going to be a very big story. Yeah, please. It’s going to be not only a big story, it’s the most important story of our time. Yes? No, I don’t want to talk about 2024 yet. Because this is far from being-look, look, look. I and the people that work in this are very professional and all of this stuff is coming. A lot of it came out, if you look at the Philadelphia meeting, if you look at the Pennsylvania meeting yesterday, a lot of it came out. This has a long way to go. This has a long way to go. You’re going to find tremendous fraud. You’re going to find fraud of hundreds of thousands of votes per state. You’re going to find fraud of many, many times the votes that I need. Again, we’re not talking about less votes where 20 votes, but it doesn’t turn the election. No, we’re talking about thousands and thousands of votes beyond what we need to turn a state. When you see that, I think it’s very hard, even for the media to say that Biden should win the state. There’s no way that Biden got 80 million votes. By the way, the only way he got 80 million votes is through a massive fraud. There’s no way that he got 80 million votes. Well, it’s happening now. I mean-we’re in courts, we’re in courts, but we’re also in front of legislatures and we’re doing very well in front of the states. Well, I told them today, I think you’re dealing in a very fraudulent system. I think I’m very worried about that. They are tremendous people. Kelly Loeffler, David Perdue are tremendous people. They should be in the United States Senate. They’re desperately needed. But I told them today, I said, “Listen, you have a fraudulent system. You have a system with the flick of a switch or the putting in of a new chip can change the course of history, and you have to be very careful.” I read this morning where Stacey Abrams has 850,000 ballots accumulated. Now, that’s called harvesting. You’re not allowed to harvest, but I understand the Secretary of State who is really, he’s an enemy of the people. The Secretary of State, and whether he’s Republican or not, this man, what he’s done, supposedly he made a deal, and you’ll have to check this, where she’s allowed to harvest, but in other areas they’re not allowed. What kind of a deal is that? They’re not allowed to harvest during the presidential. But how can she say she has 850,000 ballots? That would mean that she’s got 850,000 ballots for her. That’s not supposed to be happening. That’s not an election. You know, an election should be a one day deal. You walk in and you vote. And if you can’t do it, if for some reason you’re not feeling well or there’s a problem… But what they did is they used COVID in order to defraud the people of this country. And the whole world is watching, and the whole world is laughing at our electoral process. The whole world is watching, and it’s a very sad thing, a very sad thing. And you know what? I’ve done a lot of things. You just saw Space Force, and you’ve seen the tax cuts, and the regulation cuts, and the way we’ve taken care of the vets, and what we’ve done with Anwar and Alaska and all the different things we’ve done, more than just about anybody’s done, even though it’s four years. There are those that say what I’m doing right now is the single most important thing I’ve ever done, and I think it may be true. It may be true. The vaccines, and by the way, don’t let Joe Biden take credit for the vaccines. If Joe Biden… Joe Biden failed with the swine flu, H1N1. Totally failed with the swine flu. Don’t let him take credit for the vaccines because the vaccines were me and I pushed people harder than they’ve ever been pushed before. And we got that approved and through, and nobody’s ever seen anything like it. And you got a big resistance in the FDA from years and years of people working there for years and years, different administrations. But the vaccines, there are those that says one of the greatest things. It’s a medical miracle. Don’t let anyone try and take credit for it. But with all of the things I’ve done, this could be the most important because there’s been voter fraud going on, but never at this scale. Tens of millions of ballots have been sent out to people that didn’t even want them. Many people, and I know you’ve heard, many people have received two, three, and four ballots, and many people have taken those two, three, and four ballots and they’ve voted them. This election was a fraud. It was a rigged election. I mean, I hate to say it, but this was rigged, at the highest level, it was a rigged election. So we have to figure it out. And yes, I think it’s very dangerous for the two people that are running against two totally unqualified people. And I think it’s very dangerous for our nation. And I’ll go a step further. I said today, other than the fact that you have all of the eyes and ears, but the media doesn’t cover it properly because the media, if they saw something wrong, I’m convinced that media would not report it because you have many things that you know are wrong and you don’t report. But if the media was honest in this country, which, for the most part, they’re not, this would never have happened. This has taken place. This fraud has taken place. If the media were honest, this would never, ever have happened. But you have a big election coming up. You have a woman or somebody announced 850,000 absentee ballots have already been collected. 850, and I told David Perdue today, and I told Kelly yesterday, I said, “They’re talking about having collected already 800,000 ballots against you.” You can’t do that. You can’t do that. What kind of a race is that? You can’t allow that to happen. And I’m serious. If the media were honest and if big tech were honest, which it’s totally not, it’s a terrible thing. That whole Section 230 is a disgrace that they even have it. But big tech is totally dishonest. If the media were honest and big tech was fair, this wouldn’t even be a contest, and I would have won by a tremendous amount, a tremendous amount. And I did win by a tremendous amount, but it hasn’t been reported yet. But people understand what’s happened. They know what happened. Yes, please go. Say it? I don’t want to say that yet. I mean, I know the answer, I’ll be honest. I know the answer, but I just don’t want to say it yet. Look. A thing like this possibly has never happened before, but maybe people just didn’t catch it, but we’ve caught it. We’ve caught we’ve caught hundreds of thousands of us. Listen, excuse me, excuse me. When they don’t allow a poll watcher, which is a sacred person in our country, people don’t know what a poll watcher is. A poll watcher is, it’s considered sacred in our country. When they throw them out of rooms-Sure it is. And when they put them in pens-Excuse me. No, they didn’t. My attorneys did not admit anything and it’s all different places. But where they throw the amount of counting rooms, where they put them in what’s called pens and they’re 20, 30, 40 feet away, and in some cases 200 feet away, when things like that happen. When a woman walks in on November 3rd to vote, a proud woman, and this is by the thousands, tens of thousands, and she said, “I’m here to vote.” And they said, “You’ve already voted, ma’am. I’m sorry.” “No, I didn’t vote. I wanted to vote on November 3rd. I want to cast my vote in person.” “I’m sorry, ma’am, you’ve already voted. You voted by ballot.” And then they leave. This is a horrible thing, and we have tens of thousands of that happening. This is a horrible thing. They gave Biden a lot of votes that he would never have gotten. This is not a candidate that could get 80 million votes. This is just not a candidate. This is not a candidate that beat Barack Hussein Obama with the Black voter, okay? This is not a candidate that beat Obama with the Black voter. This is not a candidate that beat Hillary Clinton to a pulp. It just doesn’t work that way. But when you look at the number, when you look at the data, and when you look at the things we have, we have affidavits from hundreds and hundreds of people. This election was a rigged election. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you.













"
"113","12-02-20","Thank you. This may be the most important speech I’ve ever made. I want to provide an update on our ongoing efforts to expose the tremendous voter fraud and irregularities which took place during the ridiculously long November 3rd elections. We used to have what was called, election day. Now we have election days, weeks, and months, and lots of bad things happened during this ridiculous period of time, especially when you have to prove almost nothing to exercise our greatest privilege, the right to vote. As President, I have no higher duty than to defend the laws and the Constitution of the United States. That is why I am determined to protect our election system, which is now under coordinated assault and siege. For months, leading up to the Presidential election, we were warned that we should not declare a premature victory. We were told repeatedly that it would take weeks if not, months, to determine the winner, to count the absentee ballots and to verify the results. My opponent was told to stay away from the election, don’t campaign. “We don’t need you. We’ve got it. This election is done.” In fact, they were acting like they already knew what the outcome was going to be. They had it covered and perhaps they did, very sadly for our country. It was all very, very strange. Within days after the election, we witnessed an orchestrated effort to anoint the winner even while many key states were still being counted. The constitutional process must be allowed to continue. We’re going to defend the honesty of the vote by ensuring that every legal ballot is counted and that no illegal ballot is counted. This is not just about honoring the votes of 74 million Americans who voted for me, it’s about ensuring that Americans can have faith in this election and in all future elections. Today I will detail some of the shocking irregularities, abuses and fraud that had been revealed in recent weeks but before laying out just a small portion of the evidence we have uncovered, and we have so much evidence, I want to explain the corrupt mail-in balloting scheme that Democrats systematically put into place that allowed voting to be altered, especially in swing states, which they had to win. They just didn’t know that it was going to be that tough, because we were leading in every swing state by so much, far greater than they ever thought possible. While it has long been understood that the Democrat political machine engages in voter fraud from Detroit to Philadelphia, to Milwaukee, Atlanta, so many other places. What changed this year was the Democrat party’s relentless push to print and mail out tens of millions of ballots sent to unknown recipients with virtually no safeguards of any kind. This allowed fraud and abuse to occur in a scale never seen before. Using the pandemic as a pretext, Democrat politicians and judges drastically changed election procedures just months, and in some cases, weeks before the election on the 3rd of November. Very rarely were legislatures involved and constitutionally, they had to be involved, but very, very rarely, and you’ll see that as we continue to file our suits, it’s constitutionally, absolutely incorrect what took place, even from a legal standpoint. Many states, such as Nevada and California sent millions of live ballots to every person on their voter rolls whether those individuals had requested ballots or not, whether they were dead or alive, they got ballots. Other states such as Minnesota, Michigan, and Wisconsin, instituted universal absentee balloting right in the middle of an election year, sending absentee ballot requests forms to all voters on all rolls. It didn’t matter who they were. This colossal expansion of mail-in voting opened the flood gates to massive fraud. It’s a widely known fact that the voting rolls are packed with people who are not lawfully eligible to vote, including those who are deceased, have moved out of their state, and even our non-citizens of our country. Beyond this, the records are riddled with errors, wrong addresses, duplicate entries, and many other issues. This is not disputed. It has never been disputed. Dozens of counties in the key swing states have more registered voters on the rolls than they have voting age citizens, including 67 counties in Michigan. All of this is evidence. In Wisconsin, the state’s Board of Elections could not confirm the residency of more than 100,000 people, but repeatedly refused to remove those names from its voter rolls before the election. They knew why, nobody else did. I knew why. They were illegal voters. It is a travesty that in the year 2020, we do not have any means of verifying the eligibility of those who cast ballots in an election and such an important election it is, or determining who they are, whether they live in the state or whether they’re even American citizens. We have no idea. We have an in all swing states major infractions or outright fraud, which is far more in numbers or votes then we need to overturn the results of a state. In other words, in Wisconsin, as an example, where we were way up on election night, they ultimately had us miraculously losing by 20,000 votes. I can show you right here, that Wisconsin, we’re leading by a lot and then at 3:42 in the morning, there was this, it was a massive dump of votes, mostly Biden, almost all Biden. To this day, everyone’s trying to figure out, “Where did it come from?” But I went from leading by a lot, to losing by a little and that’s right here. That’s at 3:42 in the morning, that’s Wisconsin, a terrible thing, terrible, terrible thing. But we will have far more, many times more than the 20,000 votes needed to overturn the state. If we are right about the fraud, Joe Biden can’t be president. We’re talking about hundreds of thousands of votes. We’re talking about numbers like nobody has ever seen before. Just as an example, in certain states, we’ll be down by, let’s say, 7,000 votes, but we’ll find later on 20,000, 50,000, 100,00, 200,000 discrepancies or fraudulent votes, and that includes votes that went through when they were not allowed to be seen by Republican poll watchers, because the poll watchers were locked out of the building. Or people that innocently came to vote on November 3rd, who were all excited about their vote, they were happy. They were proud to be citizens of the United States of America, and they went up and they said, “I’d like to vote.” They were told that they can’t vote. “I’m sorry,” they were told, “I’m sorry. You’ve already voted by mail-in ballot. Congratulations. We received a ballot, so you can no longer vote.” They didn’t know what to do. They had no one to complain to, most just left and said, “That’s strange.” But many people complained and complained vehemently, and in a lot of cases, they filled out a provisional ballot, which was almost never used, but in virtually every case was a vote for Trump. In other words, they went in to vote and they were told that they voted and they didn’t vote. They left and they felt horror and they lost respect for our system. This happened tens of thousands of times all over the country. That’s how desperate the Democrats were. They would fill out ballots of people not even knowing if these people were going to show up. When they did show up, they said, “Sorry, you’ve already voted.” On top of everything else, we have a company that’s very suspect. It’s name is Dominion, with the turn of a dial or the change of a chip, you could press a button for Trump and the vote goes to Biden. What kind of a system is this? We have to go to paper, maybe it takes longer. But the only secure system is paper. Not these systems that nobody understands, including in many cases, the people that run them. Although, unfortunately, I think they understand them far too well. In one Michigan County, as an example, that used Dominion systems, they found that nearly 6,000 votes had been wrongly switched from Trump to Biden, and this is just the tip of the iceberg. This is what we caught. How many didn’t we catch? Are there 100s of other examples throughout the country? Are there 1000s? We just got lucky and they called it a glitch, but we found numerous glitches that evening. 96% of the company’s political donations went to Democrats, not surprisingly. Frankly, when you look at who’s running the company, who’s in charge, who owns it, which we don’t know, where are the votes counted? Which we think are counted in foreign countries, not in the United States, Dominion is a disaster. Election authorities in Texas have repeatedly blocked the deployment of Dominion systems due to concerns about security vulnerabilities and the potential for errors and outright fraud. Every district that uses Dominion systems must be carefully monitored and carefully investigated, but not only for the future. Right now, we’re worried about the present, and what went on with an election that we won without question. Under my lead, the Republicans won almost every state house in the United States, which they weren’t expected to do. We went up to 16 seats in the house. The numbers are still being tabulated, because there are nine seats that nobody really knows. They don’t know. Two weeks later, it’s still under consideration, because it’s a mess. Republicans were supposed to lose many seats, and instead they won those seats in the house, and a very important election that’s coming up will determine whether, or not we hold the Senate. David Perdue and Kelly Leffler are two tremendous people. Unfortunately, in Georgia, they’re using the same horrible dominion system, and it’s already been out that, think of it, hundreds of thousands of absentee ballots have been requested. You check it out who’s requesting those ballots. The difference is, it’s one state, and we will have our eyes on it like nobody’s ever watched anything before, because we have to win those two Senate seats. The tremendous success we had in the House of Representatives, and the tremendous success we’ve had so far in the Senate, unexpected success all over the country, and right here in Washington. It is statistically impossible that the person, me, that led the charge lost. The greatest pollsters, the real pollsters, not the ones that had us down 17 points in Wisconsin when we actually won, or the ones that had us down four or five points in Florida, and we won by many points, or had us even, and down in Texas, and we won by a lot, not those pollsters, but real pollsters. Pollsters that are fair, and honest said, “We can’t understand a thing like this. It’s never happened before. You led the country to victory, and you were the only one that was lost. It’s not possible.” The speaker of the house of a certain state said, “Sir, I expected to lose my seat, and instead, because of you, and because of that incredible charge, and all of those rallies, we had a tremendous victory, and everybody knows it. You are much more popular than me, sir, except I got many more votes than you did, and it’s impossible that that happened. There is something wrong.” I’ll tell you what’s wrong, voter fraud. Here’s an example. This is Michigan. At 6:31 in the morning, a vote dump of 149,772 votes came in unexpectedly. We were winning by a lot. That batch was received in horror. Nobody knows anything about it. By the way, there’s your line. This is one of many. Here’s what is normal, and all of a sudden, look at that. This is normal, normal. Look even here, normal, and then boom, all of a sudden, I go from winning by a lot to losing a tight race. It’s corrupt. Detroit is corrupt. I have a lot of friends in Detroit. They know it, but Detroit is totally corrupt. Look at this, look at this. That’s at 6:31 in the morning, unexpectedly came in. In the recent recount in Georgia, which means nothing because they don’t want to check signatures, and if you’re not going to check signatures in Georgia, it doesn’t work, but we have a secretary of state, and a governor who made it very difficult to check signatures. Why? You’ll have to ask them, but without a signature match, or a check, it doesn’t matter. They found thousands and thousands of votes that were out of whack, all against me. This was during a recount that I didn’t even think mattered. They found many thousands of votes, and that recount didn’t matter. The one that matters is the one that’s going on now, that because of the fact it’s so close, they had to by law give another recount, but the recount has to be a recount where they check the signatures. Otherwise, they’re just checking the same dishonest thing. It won’t matter. In this case, the signatures on envelopes are the only thing that is relevant. We will compare the signature on the envelope to the signatures from past elections, and we will find that many thousands of people signed these ballots illegally. The Democrats had this election rigged right from the beginning. They used the pandemic, sometimes referred to as the China virus, where it originated as an excuse to mail out tens of millions of ballots, which ultimately led to a big part of the fraud, a fraud that the whole world is watching, and there is no one happier right now than China. Many people received two, three and four ballots. They were sent to dead people by the thousands. In fact, dead people, and we have many examples filled out ballots, made applications, and then, voted, which is even worse. In other words, dead people went through a process. Some have been dead for 25 years. Millions of votes were cast illegally in the swing states alone, and if that’s the case, the results of the individual swing states must be overturned, and overturned immediately. Some people say that’s too far out, that’s too harsh. Well, does that mean we take a precedent, and we’ve just elected a president where the votes were fraudulent? No, it means you have to turn over the election, and everybody knows without going much further, and they’ve seen the evidence, but they don’t want to talk about it what a disaster this election was, a total catastrophe, but we’re going to show it, and hopefully, the courts in particular, the Supreme Court of the United States will see it, and respectfully, hopefully, they will do what’s right for our country, because our country can not live with this kind of an election. We could say, let’s go on to the next one, but no, we have to look also at our past. We can’t let this happen. Maybe you’ll have a revote, but I don’t think that’s appropriate. When those votes are corrupt, when they’re irregular, when they get caught, they’re terminated, and I very easily win. In all states, I very easily win, the swing states, just like I won them at 10 o’clock in the evening, the evening of the election. We’re not looking to show you 25 faulty or fraudulent votes, which don’t mean anything, because it doesn’t overturn the state, or a fifty, or a hundred. We’re showing you hundreds of thousands far more than we need, far more than the margin, far more than the law requires. We can show many times what is necessary to win the state. The media knows this, but they don’t want to report it. In fact, they outright refuse to even cover it, because they know the result if they do. Even what I’m saying now will be demeaned and disparaged, but that’s okay. I just keep on going forward, because I’m representing 74 million people, and in fact, I’m also representing all of the people that didn’t vote for me. The mail-in voting scam is the latest part of their four year effort to overturn the results of the 2016 election, and it’s been like living in hell. Our opponents have proven many times again and again, that they will say, and do anything to get back into power. The corrupt forces who are registering dead voters and stuffing ballot boxes are the same people who have perpetrated one phony and fraudulent hoax after another. You’ve been watching it now for four years. These entrenched interests oppose our movement, because we put America first. They don’t put America first, and we’re returning power to you the American people. They don’t want America first, they only want power for themselves. They want to make money, that’s why they don’t want me as your president. I’ve been investigated from soon after I announced I was running for president. When I immediately went to number one in the Republican primary polls, the investigations never stopped. They went on for four years, and I won them all, I beat them all. Russia, Russia, Russia, the impeachment hoax, and so much more. Robert Mueller spent $48 million of taxpayer money investigating me for two and a half years, issued over 2,800 subpoenas, executed nearly 500 search warrants, issued 230 orders for communications records, and conducted 500 witness interviews, all looking to take me down. There was no collusion in the end, none whatsoever. Senator Marco Rubio, the head of the Senate Intelligence Committee stated, “The committee found no evidence that then candidate Donald Trump, or his campaign colluded with the Russian government.” And, I thank Senator Rubio for that statement. Now, I hear that these same people that failed to get me in Washington have sent every piece of information to New York, so that they can try to get me there. It’s all been gone over, over and over again. For $48 million you go through tax returns, you go through everything. The New York attorney general, who recently ran for office campaigned without knowing me stating, “We will join with law enforcement and other attorneys general across this nation in removing this president from office.” I never met her. “It’s important that everybody understands”, she said, “that the days of Donald Trump are coming to an end.” And all it’s been is a big investigation in Washington and New York and any place else that can investigate because that’s what they want to do. They want to take not me, but us down. Then we can never let them do that. Everything has been looked at. A friend of mine, who’s very smart, said, “You’ve probably seen more than anybody else. You’ve probably been investigated more than anybody else. And for you to come out with a clean bill of health makes you probably the cleanest person in this country.” Some people in this administration, but fortunately not all have been beaten down and disparaged. They just disappeared. Nobody knows what happened to them. Why aren’t they active? Why aren’t they involved? There’s so much to be involved in. The corruption is so rampant. They just couldn’t take it anymore. They were threatened by Democrats with impeachment and horrible things were said about them. And they’re good people. Even recently, the head of the GSA was hounded and harassed as she reported, like she has never been before. What can I say? We caught Comey cold, we caught McCabe cold. We caught them all. We’re still waiting for a report from a man named Durham, who I have never spoken to, and I have never met. They can go after me before the election as much as they want, but unfortunately Mr. Durham didn’t want to go after these people, or have anything to do with going after them before the election. So who knows if he is ever going to even do a report. But if you look at the lies, and the leaks, and the illegal acts of behavior done by so many people, and their desire to hurt the president of the United States, something should happen. The hardest thing I have to do is explain why nothing is happening with all of these people that got caught spying on my campaign. It’s never happened before and it should never happen again to a president of the United States. All you have to do is watch the hearings and see for yourself. The evidence is overwhelming. The fraud that we’ve collected in recent weeks is overwhelming, having to do with our election. Everyone is saying, ” Wow, the evidence is overwhelming”, when they get to see it. But really it’s too late to change the course of an election. It’s too late to change the outcome. In fact, there is still plenty of time to certify the correct winner of the election and that’s what we’re fighting to do. But no matter when it happens, when they see fraud, when they see false votes and when those votes number far more than is necessary, you can’t let another person steal that election from you. All over the country, people are together in holding up signs, “Stop the steal.” To understand how we will challenge this fraud, it is important to know the problems with mail-in balloting. Pennsylvania, Michigan, Nevada, Georgia, Arizona, and most other states allowed anyone to get an absentee ballot and cast their vote without showing any ID. The voting took place entirely on the honor system, no identification of any kind was required. Most Americans would also be shocked to learn that no state in the country verifies United States citizenship as a condition for voting in federal elections. This is a national disgrace. No other advanced country conducts elections this way. Many European countries have instituted major restrictions on mail-in voting, specifically, because they recognize the nearly unlimited potential for fraud. Out of 42 European nations, all but two prohibit absentee ballots entirely for people who reside inside the country, or else they require those who need absentee ballots to show a very, very powerful ID. Throughout the Democrat effort to dramatically expand mail-in voting, the Democrat party leaders were also, feverishly working to block measures, designed to protect against fraud, such as signature verification, residency verification, or voter ID. And citizenship confirmation was almost unthought of that we should ask for it. Can you believe this? These are not the actions of people who want fair elections. These are the actions of people who want to steal elections, who are willing to create fraud. The only conceivable reason why you would block common sense measures to verify legal eligibility for voting, is you are trying to encourage, enable, solicit, or carry out fraud. It is important for Americans to understand that these destructive changes to our election laws were not a necessary response to the pandemic. The pandemic simply gave the Democrats an excuse to do what they have been trying to do for many, many years. In fact, the very first bill that house Democrats introduced when Nancy Pelosi became speaker, was it attempt to mandate universal mail-in voting and eliminate measures such as voter ID, which is so necessary. Dramatically eroding the integrity of our elections was the Democrats number one priority for a simple reason, they wanted to steal the 2020 presidential election. All of the Democrat efforts to expand mail-in balloting laid the groundwork for the systematic and pervasive fraud that occurred in this election. In Pennsylvania, large amounts of mail-in and absentee ballots were processed illegally. And in secret, in Philadelphia, in Allegheny counties, without our observers present. They were not allowed to be present. In fact, they weren’t even allowed in the same room. They were thrown out of the building and they looked from outside in, but they had no way of even seeing, because there were no windows. And the windows that were there were boarded up. Democrats even went to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to block observers from receiving access. There is only one possible reason that the corrupt Democrat political machine would oppose transparency during the vote counting. It’s because they know they are hiding illegal activity. It’s very simple. This is an egregious, inexcusable. And irreversible harm that stains the entire election, yet this unprecedented practice of excluding our observers, our vote watchers, as some people call them, occurred in Democrat run cities and key states all across the nation. Here are just some of the additional facts that we’ve uncovered. Many voters all across Pennsylvania received two ballots in the mail, and many others received mail-in ballots for which they never applied. So many get ballots, they didn’t even know what they were for. And again, so many received more than one ballot. In some cases, more than two ballots. And they happened to be, for the most part, Democrats. In Fayette County, Pennsylvania, multiple voters received ballots that were already filled out. They didn’t know what happened. In Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, a poll watcher, overheard unregistered voters being told to return later to try to vote under a different name. Tens of thousands of voters across Pennsylvania were treated differently based on whether they were Republicans, or Democrats. Voters who submitted floored ballots in some Democrat precincts were notified and asked to fix their ballots, while Republican precincts, and in particular Republican voters, were not so notified which plainly violates the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution.”If you are a Democrat, we’re going to fix up your ballot. make sure it’s perfect. If you are Republican, don’t even talk about it.” In Michigan, a career employee of the city of Detroit, with the city workers, coaching voters to vote straight Democrat, while accompanying them to watch who they were voting for, violating the law and the sanctity of the secret ballot. You can’t do that. The same workers say she was instructed not to ask for any ID and not to attempt to validate any signatures. She was also told to illegally backdate ballots, many, many ballots, received after the deadline. This is something that is so unconstitutional and she estimates that thousands and thousands of ballots were improperly backdated by her and many others. Other witnesses in Detroit also saw our election officials counting batches of the same ballots many times, as well as illegally duplicating ballots. One observer testified to seeing boxes and boxes of ballots, all bearing the same signature. Another observer in Detroit gave sworn testimony that he saw countless and valid ballots that did not belong to properly registered voters and then witnessed election workers in Wayne County entering fake birth dates into the system, in order to illegally count them. Witnesses of science wore an affidavit, so in other words, you go to jail if you lie, testifying that after election officials announced the last absentee votes had been received, a batch of tens of thousands of ballots arrived, many without envelopes, all voting for Democrats. In Wisconsin, a record number of voters were categorized as indefinitely confined. A status reserved for severely disabled individuals, also for the elderly that allow them to vote without showing ID. Last year, approximately 70,000 people claimed this status statewide. This year, the number miraculously was nearly 250,000 voters, after election officials in Milwaukee and Dane County, a couple of the most corrupt political places in our country, urged citizens to improperly register under this status. And register they did in levels that don’t exist. In Wisconsin, there are approximately 70,000 absentee ballots that do not have matching ballot applications as required by law in Georgia, nine observers have testified to seeing countless irregular ballots without the creases or typical markings indicating that the ballots did not arrive in envelopes as required. A poll watcher in Fulton County estimated that approximately 98% of the large number of unusually pristine ballots that she witnessed were for Biden. Highly unusual number. In addition, thousands of uncounted ballots were discovered in Floyd, Fayette, and Walton counties weeks after the election, and these ballots were mostly from Trump voters. They weren’t counted. They were from Trump voters. In Detroit, everybody saw the tremendous conflict and the horrible way that the two Republican canvassers were treated so horribly because they wouldn’t vote when they saw that 71% of the precincts didn’t balance. Also, there were more votes than there were voters. Think of that. You had more votes than you had voters. That’s an easy one to figure, and it’s by the thousands. In Arizona, in-person voters whose balanced produced error messages from tabulation machines were told to press a button that resulted in their votes not being counted. Also in Arizona, the attorney general announced that mail-in ballots had been stolen from mailboxes and hidden under a rock. In Clark County, Nevada, where most of the state’s voters reside, the standards for matching a signature using the signature verification machine were intentionally lowered to allow large numbers of ballots to be counted that otherwise would never have passed muster. This machine was set at the lowest level. According to one report, in order to test the process, nine voters in Clark County cast ballots with intentionally incorrect signatures, and eight of the nine ballots were accepted and counted. They said you could sign your name as Santa Claus, and it would be accepted. Last week, the Clark County Commission threw out the results of a local election after the registrar reported finding, quote, “discrepancies that we can’t explain.” Also in Nevada, some voters were entered into a raffle for more than a dozen gift cards worth as much as $250 if they could prove they had voted. This took place on Indian reservations. One of the most significant indications of widespread fraud is the extraordinarily low rejection rates for mail-in ballots in many key states. These are the states that I had to win. In swing state after swing state, the number of ballots rejected has been dramatically lower than what would have been expected based on prior experience. That means years and years of voting. In Georgia, just 0.2%, that’s substantially less than 1%, of mail-in ballots have been rejected. In other words, almost none have been rejected. They took everything. Nothing was rejected, practically, compared to 6.4% in 2016. There are those that think that 6.4 was a low number. Think of it. Almost none were rejected. The previous election, 6.4% were rejected. We have seen similar declines in Pennsylvania, Nevada, and Michigan. Ballots weren’t rejected, especially if they happen to be in Democrat areas. These irregularities are inexplicable unless there is a deliberate effort to accept ineligible ballots or fraudulent ballots. In Pennsylvania, the secretary of state and the state supreme court in essence abolished signature verification requirements just weeks prior to the election, in violation of state law. You’re not allowed to do that. It has to be approved by the legislature. A judge can’t do it. A state can’t do it. An official can’t do it. The only one that can do it is the legislature. The reason for this is clear. They were not verifying signatures because they know the ballots have not been filled out by the voters in whose names they were cast. In other words, people filled them out that had nothing to do with the names on the ballot. A simple recount of the ballots under these circumstances only compounds the fraud. The only way to determine whether there was an honest vote is to conduct a full review of the envelopes in the relevant states. You will find that many of them, tens of thousands, have fraudulent signatures. A full forensic audit is required to ensure that only legal ballots from lawfully registered voters that were properly cast are included in the final count. This election is about great voter fraud, fraud that has never been seen like this before. It’s about poll watchers who were not allowed to watch. So illegal. It’s about ballots that poured in, and nobody but a few knew where they came from. They were counted, and they weren’t for me. It’s about big leads on election night, tremendous leads, leads where I was being congratulated for a decisive easy victory. All of a sudden, by morning or a couple of days later, those leads rapidly evaporated. It’s about numbers of ballots that were sent that nobody know where they came from. It’s about machinery that was defective, machinery that was stopped during certain parts of the evening, miraculously to open with more votes. It was about many other things, but above all, it was about fraud. This election was rigged. Everybody knows it. I don’t mind if I lose an election, but I want to lose an election fair and square. What I don’t want to do is have it stolen from the American people. That’s what we’re fighting for. We have no choice to be doing that. We already have the proof. We already have the evidence, and it’s very clear. Many people in the media and even judges so far have refused to accept it. They know it’s true. They know it’s there. They know who won the election, but they refuse to say, “You’re right.” Our country needs somebody to say, “You’re right.” Ultimately, I am prepared to accept any accurate election result, and I hope that Joe Biden is as well. We already have the proof. We already have tens of thousands of ballots more than we need to overturn all of these states that we’re talking about. This is an election for the highest office in the greatest country in the history of the world. Every reasonable American should be able to agree, based on what we have already documented, that we need a systematic analysis of the mail-in ballots to review the envelopes. It’s about the signature. If they’re on the envelopes, we can only review the envelopes, and that will tell us everything. This is the absolute minimum we should expect. This is not just about my campaign, although it has a lot to do with who’s going to be your next president. This is about restoring faith and confidence in American elections. This is about our democracy and the sacred rights that generations of Americans have fought, bled, and died to secure. Nothing is more urgent or more important. The only ballots that should count in this election are those cast by eligible voters who are citizens of our country, residents of the states in which they voted, and who cast their ballots in a lawful manner before the legal deadline. Moreover, we must never again have an election in which there is not a reliable and transparent system to verify the eligibility, identity, and residency of every single person who casts a ballot, a very, very cherished ballot. Many very smart people have congratulated me on all we’ve done: the biggest tax cuts in history, regulation cuts, the biggest in history. We rebuilt our military. We took care of our vets like never before, Space Force, and so much more. Then they went on to say, as big and as important as these events were, the single greatest achievement in your presidency will be exactly what you’re doing right now: voter integrity for our nation. It’s more important than any of the things that we discussed. If we don’t root out the fraud, the tremendous and horrible fraud that’s taken place in our 2020 election, we don’t have a country anymore. With the resolve and support of the American people, we will restore honesty and integrity to our elections. We will restore trust in our system of government. Thank you. God bless you. God bless America.

"114","12-03-20","being honored, the Presidential Medal of Freedom to one of the greatest coaches in American history, the legendary Lou Holtz, a friend of mine. Great gentlemen, great man. We’re delighted to be joined this afternoon by members of Lou’s wonderful family, along with the director of national intelligence, John Ratcliffe. John, thank you for being here. And Senator Lindsey Graham, who I think most people know, I would say they know you for the most part. And Pat Cipollone, a big fan of Notre Dame, right? Thank you, Pat, for being here. Lou was born during the Great Depression in the steel town of Follansbee, West Virginia. We love West Virginia. He grew up in poverty in a two room cellar. But as Lou says, “I knew God and my family loved me, and their love was all the wealth I needed. That’s everything I needed. That’s all I wanted.” As a child, Lou sat in his uncle and grandfather’s lap and listened to Notre Dame football games on the radio. They were big fans of Notre Dame, I guess, even before you. That wasn’t too long ago, was it? They were big fans. And so he learned at an early age about Notre Dame. At the age of nine, he took the field in his first game. He then played throughout high school. And Lou went on to attend Kent State, where he did very well on an ROTC scholarship. After graduation, Lou served as an officer of the United States Army, and then pursued his dream of coaching. He wanted to be a coach right from the beginning because he knew he was a leader. He didn’t have to say it. He knew he was a leader. In 1961, Lou made what he described as, “The smartest decision of my life.” And I knew your wife. And I will tell you that was your smartest decision, right? We got to know her well, she was strong and good. He married his wife of 59 years. Beth passed away just a short while ago. And it was a very tough time. I will tell you it was a very tough time for Lou and the family, but we know that she’s looking down from heaven right now with incredible pride. She’s so proud of this man. I got to know her over the last few years and she was a great woman, but she’s looking down right now. She’s very proud of you, Lou. In 1969, Lou became head coach at William and Mary. And over three seasons, he won the Southern Conference and led the tribe to their first bowl game in 22 years. And by the way, and I have to tell you, when we were researching this out, I knew he was supposed to be a good coach, but I didn’t know how good he was because these stats are very amazing. You’ll see. I was really a very impressed, John. Lou then became head coach of North Carolina State, which had won only nine games over the previous three years. Not too good. He took it over, and under Coach Holtz, they won the ACC title and achieved the highest national ranking in NC State’s history. Lou went on to coach, and so I guess you were making a lot of money by this time because they were trying to get him to go to all these different schools. He was a hot coach. Nothing like being hot, right? He had his choice. He had his choice of going to a lot of different places. Lou went on to coach at the University of Arkansas. He built the Razorbacks up from a five and five record into a top five team in the nation. They won everything. Lou left Arkansas with the best win-loss record ever and a very fat bank account. He then coached at the university of … You were making a lot of money over this time. I know how that works. He then coached at the University of Minnesota, which was ranked dead last in the Big 10. Before he signed his contract, he prayed. And then he did something that was unprecedented. He inserted a clause with great negotiation talent, which he has, they call today the Notre Dame clause. It stipulated that if Lou did really well and went to a bowl game, he would be free to go to Notre Dame should they ask him to go. So he had something going, right? You great football player, you are some player. You are something. And you weigh about 30 pounds less than you weighed when you played in the NFL, right? I’m very impressed. In just two years, he secured a top 20 ranking and propelled the Golden Gophers to victory at the Independence Bowl. So he was on his way to Notre Dame. He knew it, nobody else did. I guess the Notre Dame officials knew it. He was offered a coaching job at Notre Dame immediately. And he also took it immediately, as much as he loved the team that he just left. When he became the head coach a year later, the Fighting Irish were a losing team. They were doing very, very poorly. Lou got to work and quickly returned Notre Dame to the status of a football powerhouse and the legend that they were. At the end of Lou’s first season, the team faced off against their arch rivals, the University of Southern California Trojans. The Fighting Irish were down 17 points in the fourth quarter, but they soon pulled off, Notre Dame, one of the greatest comebacks in college football history. They scored two touchdowns in less than eight minutes and then kicked the field goal in the final two seconds of the game. At that moment, Holtz said he felt the spirit of Notre Dame. He loved Notre Dame. And do you still remember that game? You weren’t too happy about. So your son has a little of you in him. For the next decade, the Fighting Irish won 80% of their games and went to nine consecutive New Year’s Day Bowls. And in 1988, cover of Sports Illustrated said, “Notre Dame is back.” Notre Dame is back. He was on the cover of Sports Illustrated and many other covers. Notre Dame remained number one in the country for the longest stretch in the school’s history. See, I didn’t know all this stuff. I knew you were a great coach. I didn’t know you were this good, to be honest. This is beyond a great coach. So you had the longest streak in the history of Notre Dame at number one. What do you think about that, Lindsey? It sounds like you and the Senate. He had an easy race. You know, he had an easy race. The problem was his opponent had $140 million. That was a record, I guess, wasn’t it? Guess what? Here’s Lindsey. During the tenure at Notre Dame, Lou coached a record number of games, secured 100 victories, and delivered Notre Dame’s most recent national championship. So he did some job at Notre Dame. Then Lou became the head coach at the University of South Carolina, which he loves. He loves South Carolina. Which had one only one bowl game in 108 years. He was going to take it easy. And then he gets another role. Man oh man, I’m watching that money just pile up. He was going to go and just relax now. He did his thing at Notre Dame, he won national championships, the longest streak. Then he goes to University of South Carolina. And I can imagine why. You do like money a little bit, don’t you? He was offered a big deal. Lou tripled that number and secured a top 20 ranking immediately. Over the course of his career, Lou won nearly 250 games and is, one of the highest ever, by the way, and is the only coach in NCAA history to take six different teams to a bowl game. Think of that. Wherever Lou went, football glory followed. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2008. And I will say this about Lou. Everybody loves him. Everybody respects him. He’s tough as hell. And yet they all respect Lou. They just, it’s amazing. They love him and they respect him. Sometimes it’s a combination that doesn’t come together. They respect. But you are something. “I never coached football. I coached life,” he said. And it’s true. His players really always loved him. He’s turned his inspirational story and motivational message into three best-selling books. He’s also been an exceptional philanthropist. That’s all that stuff that he collected. He’s opened educational opportunities for students, provided insulin pumps to diabetic children. And we’ve just brought down the price and the cost of insulin, right? You’re shaking your head. It’s amazing what we did, right? Insulin. You couldn’t buy it. It was destroying families. People were going without it. Now it’s $35, right? You can’t believe it. I see you’re an insulin pro. You’re involved, right? Family. That’s great. Now we’ve done a great job with costs. But insulin maybe, Lindsey, is one of the best. $35. They were paying 10 times that amount. You couldn’t get it. So we changed that around, Lou. And supported cancer research and has traveled to 13 countries to visit the American troops. Lou’s leadership and his faith and kindness have inspired and uplifted millions of fellow citizens. He’s one of the greatest titans in American football history, and his towering reputation will endure forever in the chronicles of athletics, but more importantly in the chronicles of life because he’s really a life teacher. That’s what he is. He’s a life teacher. He teaches people how to live and how to live properly and how to live with dignity. So I’d like to now ask the military aid to come forward and prepare for me to give our highest medal. We have the Congressional Medal of Honor, and we have the Presidential Medal of Freedom. And I will say, I give away a lot of Congressional Medal of Honors and that’s a tough one to get. That’s a tough one to get because they come in with … When they come in, a lot of times, mostly they can’t come in for obvious reasons. But they come in, they’re unbelievably brave people and they have had more bullet holes and bullets shot at them and in them. That’s the Congressional Medal of Honor. Your route is a much easier one. As tough as it may have been, it’s a much easier one. I always say that about the two. It’s your route is a much easier. The Presidential Medal of Freedom. So I’d like to ask first, Lou, to say a few words. And then we’re going to present it. Thank you very much. Thank you. That’s so nice. Thank you very much. Thank you. Such a great statement. Thank you. I will. And I think they’re getting very close. And I want it to happen. And I believe that they’re getting very close to a deal. Yeah. I will, I will. Absolutely, yeah. Well, he hasn’t done anything. So he hasn’t looked. When he looks, he’ll see the kind of evidence that right now you’re seeing in the Georgia Senate. They’re going through hearings right now in Georgia and they’re finding tremendous volumes. So they haven’t looked very hard, which is a disappointment, to be honest with you, because it’s massive fraud. Whether you go to Wisconsin, where we just filed a case, or Michigan, or if you look at what’s happening in Georgia, as an example, or Pennsylvania. If you look at Nevada, which is moving along very rapidly, or Arizona, you saw those numbers come out yesterday, we found massive fraud. And in other states also. This is probably the most fraudulent election that anyone’s ever seen. Ask me that in a number of weeks from now. They should be looking at all of this fraud. This is not say well, he thought it was civil. This is not civil, this is criminal stuff. This is very bad criminal stuff. So I just say this. We went through an election. At 10:00, everybody said that was an easy victory for Trump. All of a sudden, the votes started disappearing, miraculously disappearing. We found much of it, but we found far more votes than we need in almost all of these states. And I think I can say in all of these states, far more votes than we need to win every one of them. And I want to just thank my team because my team is doing an unbelievable job. And more importantly, I want to thank the 74 million plus people that voted. Which, Lou, is the largest amount of people that a sitting president has ever had. 74 million plus. And because the level of loyalty, I’ve never seen anything like it. All over the country, they know it was a fixed election. It was a rigged election. They know it and I appreciate their support. Thank you all very much.

"115","12-06-20","Thank you. Thank you. A very popular First Lady, I have to admit. Thank you very much and thank you, Melania. And I want to say, hello, Georgia. We did a great job. You know we won Georgia, just so you understand. And we won Florida and we won a lot of places. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Well, thank you very much. Thank you. No, we won a lot of places. We won Florida. We won Ohio. Big, big. We won them big. Remember we were going to lose Florida they said. We were five down in Florida. We won by a lot. We were way down in Ohio and we won by a lot. I think they say that if you win Florida and if you win Ohio in history, you’ve never lost an election. This has got to be a first time. But the truth is they were right, we’ve never lost that election. We’re winning this election. And I will say, we’re fighting very hard for this state. When you look at all of the corruption and all of the problems having to do with this election, all I can do is campaign and then I wait for the numbers. But when the numbers come out of ceilings and come out of leather bags, you start to say, “What’s going on?” But I want to just tell you that I love this state. I love the people in this state and I’m thrilled to be back in magnificent Georgia with thousands of proud, hardworking American patriots. Let me begin by wishing you all a very Merry Christmas. Remember the word. Remember. We started five years ago, and I said you’re going to be saying Christmas again. And we say it proudly again, although there’ll be trying to take that word again out of the vocabulary. We’re not going to let them do that. I also want to express our profound condolences to the family of Harrison Deal, a young and brilliant campaign staffer for Senator Loeffler, who tragically died in a terrible car accident yesterday. You know about it. He was an incredible magnificent young man. And I just want to say our prayers are with his friends and loved ones and we will keep his memory in our hearts. And he’s looking down right now and he’s very proud of Kelly and David. He’s very proud of all of us. So I just want to express my best wishes to the family and everybody. Thank you. Thank you, Kelly. And let me also express our warmest best wishes and love to all of those people and families suffering from the COVID pandemic. Vaccines are on their way at a level that nobody ever thought possible. It would have taken another administration five years. It took us seven months and they’re starting next week and we’re going to start vaccinating. And a lot of people already are vaccinated. It’s called you have … You caught it and you’re immune. I hope it’s true. They say that before I had it, they said if you catch it, you’re immune for life. Once I got it, they said, if you catch it, you’re immune for four months. Right. But they’re on their way, the vaccines and they’re great vaccines and safe, and brilliant actually to think of it, what we’ve done in such a short period of time. Nobody thought. They call it, even some of the enemies call it a medical miracle what we’ve done. And we also have great therapeutics and they’re already here and I can testify to that fact. I’ll tell you what, some incredible work has been done over the last seven months. And we should always get credit for that. Don’t let anyone ever take it away from us. We’re gathered here tonight to ensure … A very important word, ensure because these are two great, great people that I know so well and respected by everybody in Washington and beyond, that David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler win the most important congressional runoff, probably in American history. I really believe that. I think it’s in American … There’s never been a time like this, where you have two at one time, at least you have two beauties. And you know what, you also have two beauties running against them, but beauty in a different way, there are two beauties. But there’s never been a case where a state has had this prominence on Senate races because they’re never together. And this is something that’s very important and you have to get out and you have to vote. You have to make sure you have every vote counted. Every one has to count. You got to make sure they don’t throw away any ballots. You got to make sure that when they collect the ballots and they start bragging about how many ballots they already have, you got to make sure your secretary of state knows what the hell he’s doing. And you got to make sure your governor gets a lot tougher than he’s been. He’s got to get a lot tougher. Because at stake in this election is control of the US Senate and that really means control of this country. The voters of Georgia will determine which party runs every committee, writes every piece of legislation, controls every single taxpayer dollar. Very simply, you will decide whether your children will grow up in a socialist country or whether they will grow up in a free country. And I will tell you this, socialist is just the beginning for these people. These people want to go further than socialism. They want to go into a communistic form of government. I have no doubt about it. Somehow that doesn’t suit Georgia too well. That doesn’t work too well I think, Kelly, in Georgia, does it? David and Kelly are running against radical Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock. Ossoff and Warnock are the two most extreme, far-left liberal Senate candidates in the history of our country, and you got them both at one time. How did that happen? I think you both got lucky, but we’ll see, right? We’ll see. You must go vote and vote early starting December 14th. You have to do it. They cheated and they rigged our presidential election, but we will still win it. We will still win it. We’ll still win it. And they’re going to try and rig this election too. No, we continue to fight. We’ve had some great moments. We just need somebody with courage to do what they have to do because everyone knows it’s wrong. We need somebody with courage, somebody that makes decisions, then we’ll be going up to the Supreme Court very shortly. And we really, if we have-if we have courage and wisdom, I think, you know what the answer’s going to be because you can’t let people get away with what they got away with. Think of it, with over 74 million votes, over, think of that, more than … I got more votes than any sitting president in history. 11 million more votes than we got in 2016. And we thought that if we could get 68 million, 67 million that would be the end. All of our great, brilliant geniuses said you’d win if you get 67 or 68. It’s over. We got 74 million-plus and they’re trying to convince us that we lost. We didn’t lose. They found a lot of ballots to be nice about it. And they got rid of some too. The 74, let me tell you, the 74 could have been even higher. As the great pollster, John McLaughlin, who was really a great pollster, one of the most highly respected, he said, “There’s no way this could have happened other than the obvious cheating or a rigged election. There’s no way it could have happened.” It’s interesting, I wrote this out and I had just a few of the facts, which I think … Because I want to get onto the presidentials. I want to stay on presidential, but I got to get to these two because they’re incredible. But listen to this. These are the facts. And each fact is irrefutable and it means win. President Trump received, done by one of the most brilliant political people, President Trump received more votes than any previous incumbent president in history. And we lost. And we lost. So, we received more votes than anybody in history, any incumbent in history, and we lost, supposedly. We didn’t lose. You’re going to see that. No incumbent who received 75% of the total primary vote lost reelection in the history of our country. President Trump received 94, not 74. 94, which is one of the highest in history. In fact, President Trump is the only one of five incumbents since 1912 to receive more than 90% of the primary vote. And again, anybody received over 75%, they won. We got 94%. President Trump set a record for the most primary votes ever received by an incumbent, ever. And nobody that’s received all of the primary votes, nobody’s received at a much lesser level than what we, they always won. But we didn’t according to what they say. It’s rigged. It’s a fixed deal. Nationally, initial numbers show that 26% of President Trump’s voting share came from nonwhite voters. The highest percentage for a GOP presidential candidate since 1960. That’s a long time ago. President Trump won … Think of this one. President Trump won 18 of 19 bellwether counties. You know what a bellwether county is, it’s a big deal. So I won 18 of 19, a record, never happened. That between 1980 and 2016 voted for the eventual president in every single election, and before that, it was almost every election. And we won a record 18 of 19. Never lost. Nobody’s ever lost with anything like that. Biden did not demonstrate coattails for the downballot races, had no coattails. I’m shocked to hear that. In fact, he got 80 million votes. But what he made a Thanksgiving day speech on the internet, they say he had less than a thousand people. How do you have 80 million votes and you have a thousand people? Now how do you have 80 million votes and you have less than a thousand people? With Republicans maintaining control … So here’s what happened. So Biden didn’t demonstrate coattails downballot races, but with Republicans maintaining control, first time this has ever happened, control of the Senate, winning all 27 toss-up races in the House. Kevin McCarthy, great job. Mitch, great job. Winning all 27 toss-up races. And now, think of it. We didn’t lose a seat in the House. Think of this. The first time that anybody, I think in history, we didn’t lose one seat. Normally, you lose two, three, five, and you replay. We lost nobody sitting in Congress. I worked hard in the House, with Kevin McCarthy, not losing a single legislative chamber and making big gains at the state level and holding onto the Senate. I mean, look at what’s happened. We better hold onto the Senate, you two. And there’s never been numbers like that where a president even came close to losing, but they say we lost. The only way is they stuffed the ballot boxes. President Trump won. President Trump won as we said both in Florida and then Ohio. And by the way, won by a lot. Remember the fake polls where they said he’s down by four in Florida, and I won by a lot. He’s down by two in Ohio, and we won. I think we got eight or nine or something, up. But nobody’s ever done that. Those two very powerful, big, important states. And the beauty is that we also won Georgia, and that was good. We won South Carolina and we won Iowa. Remember, we’re not going to win an Iowa they said. We’re not going to win. I think the farmers like Trump a lot, right? Well, we want an Iowa by a lot. We won in Iowa by close to record numbers. I think I have the record. And we won all over the place. And many of these swing states, it’s a very interesting statistic. President Obama beat Biden all over the country, except in some of the swing states where Biden beat him badly. How does that work? And they say it’s statistically impossible. He beat crooked Hillary. Think of this. He beat crooked Hillary in the swing states, but she beat him everywhere else. Let me tell you, this election was rigged and we can’t let it happen to two of the greatest, most respected people in Washington. We can’t let it happen again. Can’t let it happen. Can’t let it happen. Can’t let it happen. Your governor could stop it very easily if he knew what the hell he was doing. He could stop it very easily. Hundreds of thousands of illegal votes were cast in each state. Far from … I mean, if you look at this, hundreds of thousands more than we needed were cast in every state we’re talking about, not only here, but Michigan, Pennsylvania. How about Pennsylvania where they throw the poll Watchers out? They threw them out. They literally threw them out. And they did it here too, by the way. But we caught them cold and have numerous cases pending. And so far we haven’t been able to find the people with the courage to do the right thing. And that is true in Georgia, certainly. But we’re going to hit those people and they’re going to go down in history as great people. They’re going to go down because everyone knows what took place. But we’re going to talk about the presidential election a little bit later because we have a big senatorial race going on in Georgia and we are watching Democrats very, very closely. And remember this, we had this massive race all over the country, so they could cheat in Georgia and people aren’t really watching it like they should. And again, all I can do is say I’m running, win, and then do a good job as president. That’s all. I don’t run the elections. I don’t run to see if people are walking in with suitcases and putting them under a table with a black robe around it. I don’t do that. That’s up to your government here. And for whatever reason, your secretary of state and your governor are afraid of Stacey Abrams. They’re afraid of her. So we know the Democrats are planning to cheat and we can’t let them do it again. And we’re going to pull ours out one way or the other. But we have to be vigilant because I don’t want these two to work like that I … I thought we were going to easily win. And then maybe for the first time in a long time, I’d go take a nice little vacation for about two days and then we’d go back. And instead, I probably worked harder in the last three weeks than I’ve ever worked in my life doing this. And I’ve become friendly with legislators that I didn’t know four weeks ago and actually, they’re great people. In fact, in my pocket right here, we have a couple of them right here. Where’s Burt Jones. Where’s Burt Jones? Burt. Burt, boy, you’re a young guy. I thought you were young, but not that young. Burt Jones, I want to thank you, Burt, for being here. You’re friendly with a man next to you, right? He’s a man of courage. Thank you very much, Burt. I appreciate everything you’re doing and so does this big crowd. And this is a big … This is a lot of people. Also, Brandon Beach, Senator Brandon Beach. Brandon, thank you for everything. We appreciate it. William Liggins. William. Where’s William? Why are you so far away, William, from them? Oh, I like that group better actually. I agree. And Greg Dolezal, where’s Greg? Greg, thank you very much, Greg. We appreciate it. Really do. We appreciate it. Great people. And we said, have this brought back into your legislature, governor, have it brought back. Let these people make it. Keep it open, keep it transparent, and let us have a signature verification. What’s wrong with that? They keep counting the same votes. I said, “Don’t count votes, look at the signature. You’re going to find the signatures aren’t what they were two years ago, four years ago, six years ago.” But are two great Senate opponents, and these are the two people that fight and they’re going to fight like … I don’t know if you know this, but one of the people that you’re fighting, I went against him, Ossoff, four years ago. He was against a very fine woman, Karen, who was a great woman, and he was leading by quite a bit and we ended up beating him. He didn’t even live in the district. He was running for Congress. He didn’t even live in the district. So we’re going to have the same thing. But Ossoff and Warnock will be total pawns of Chuck Schumer, Crying Chuck. I only see him cry when the cameras are on. But he said, he did say this, maybe I’m hurting you when I say, he did say this, “If we get in we’re going to absolutely make Donald Trump’s life miserable.” Can you believe that? That’s Chuck Schumer. He made the statement. “We’re going to investigate him.” Oh, those investigations, we’ll go on and on. Well, they’ve been investigating me since the day we came down on the escalator, which what turned out to be our great First Lady, we came down to the escalator, right? Okay. And a spider in our campaign and lots of other things. But Nancy Pelosi, AOC, Bernie Sanders, and the lunatic radical left, that’s what you’re going to have. As Chuck Schumer said rather infamously, “First we take Georgia, then we take America.” But they don’t mean to take America in a good sense. They mean bring it over to things that the people of Georgia don’t want. You’re not going to like it when they want to take over your farm. “Gee, we own this farm too. We were here also. We own this farm.” Here’s exactly how they will change America forever. The radical Democrats, if they get power, they will immediately abolish the Senate filibuster, allowing them to pass any bill they want and giving them free rein to ram through the most extreme left-wing agenda ever conceived while at the same time, destroying our military through a lack of funding. And by the way, tell our senators end Section 230. End Section 230. Put it in. We put it in. I want it in the defense bill. Put it in because it’s a national security problem. It’s a big national security. So hopefully, Mitch and the senators will put it in. But it’s the one chance we have to bring big tech, who are vicious and violent and untruthful, to bring big tech … It’s the only thing they fear is that we’re going to end Section 230. So hopefully, we will do it. It happens to be a politically very popular thing to do, by the way. If these people get control, their draconian, military cuts will devastate Fort Benning, Fort Gordon, and the military families all across Georgia. We would also like to save the names of the forts if you don’t mind everybody. They have the right. They put in the Elizabeth Pocahontas Warren clause, where they have the right to take all the names of our past warriors heroes in some cases, many cases, some turned out to be heroes in disguise, perhaps, but they want to take the names off and they have the right to desecrate, to take down, to destroy, to demolish places in our national parks that we don’t want demolished. So we have to be very careful of that. We can’t let that happen. They want to put it in our military bill. Of all people, Elizabeth Warren puts that clause in the military bill. They will impose total open borders so that people can pour into our country and they will give them free healthcare, free welfare, and the right to vote in your elections. You won’t ever win another election as a Republic. They even want to take down the wall. The wall, I won on the wall too. We won on a lot of things. “Take down the wall,” I heard him say it the other day. “We will take down the wall.” We have the strongest border we’ve ever had now. We’re almost finished with the wall. Strongest border, right, Sonny? And we built it despite … It’s incredible, the effect it’s having. We built it despite, everybody said no chance. I mean, we had a whole very powerful Democrat party oppose me. And yesterday, I don’t know if you saw it, the court oppose me. And yesterday, I don’t know if you saw it, the court just ruled that the money I took was taken legally. So at least we have a legal wall. The appeals court. So we took it and we built the wall and we’ll be finished with it very soon, but it’s had a tremendous impact on illegal immigrants coming into the country. And by the way, we want people to come into our country, you see that by the vote I got, but we want people to come in legally and through merit. Through merit, where they can help us. The radical Democrats will implement nationwide catch and release. You know that is? You catch a killer, you catch a rapist and you say, “Oh, thank you very much. Please give us your name. Oh, come back in three years. We’re going to put you on trial. Oh, Good.” You never see them by the way. Remember I had that debate with Joe Biden? He said, “No, they come back.” Yeah, they don’t come back. They don’t come back. No. They don’t come back. Like, never. Maybe 1%, but I doubt it. That’s the end of them. You let them loose in our country. I got rid of it. You think that was easy? And install sanctuary cities all across the country, that’s what they want, freeing criminal aliens and MS-13 gang members, the most vicious people. They don’t like guns because it’s not painful enough. They like using knives. It’s true. They don’t like guns, they’d rather cut somebody up. To wreak havoc and terror upon innocent families. We’ve moved thousands and thousands of MS-13s the hell out of our country. We moved them back to where they came from. And some, we put in prison because they’re too dangerous to move back because they’ll try and figure away. They’re not stupid. They’re vicious, but they’re not stupid, sort of like the Democrats if you think about. They’ll confiscate privately owned firearms and share… What they will do, they will share everything with themselves, only dangerous equipment. And they will totally cut up a thing called your second amendment rights. They’ll Make Washington DC a State and many other places guaranteeing two, four, or six additional left wing senators. They want to make numerous places States, this way you have a lot more… Louie, you’re going to have a lot more company in Congress. You’ll have lots of… You’ll have another 30, 40 congressional people from places you’ve never even heard of. You’ve never even heard of. Louie Gohmert. The great Louie Gohmert. And there’ll be voting against Georgia every time, completely canceling out your voice in Washington forever like David Perdue. I’ll never forget it. You got hit by a piece of a hurricane. Remember that? The farmers got hit so hard. And I went with Sonny and with David or some other great people from Georgia. And I said, “Is there a way we can pay these people?” They never asked for anything, and their orchards were wiped out. One of the men said, “This was going to be the best crop I ever had. I was a week and a half away from finally, after 10, 12 years making some money.” And a week and a half early, he gets hit by the remnants of that big hurricane from Florida. Great state, great place. But you got hit. And David, we took 100% care of those people, right? We took 100% care, yeah, with the help of Sonny Purdue, Secretary of Agriculture. And I felt so good. But I met them. There were 33 of them standing and they were all in the line. “What do you do?” “I have this?” “What?” It was a tragic… And nobody wanted anything. They didn’t even want it. They said, “If we could borrow it, if we could…” They didn’t want it. These are incredible people. They don’t want anything. They just want a level playing field, but we took care of them. They’d never forgot it either. It’s very interesting. I still hear from some of those people. The extreme left will pack the Supreme Court with 24 radical Justices. That’s the last number I heard. I used to hear it was 16, now it’s up to 24. Pretty soon, you’ll have another Congress. Twenty-four radical justice is instead of nine justices that we have right now. And they want them to revolve up and down the court system so that Supreme Court Justices can spend time in other locations, down the totem pole. They want to hurt the Supreme Court and they want to hurt it very badly. And if these two don’t get in, or if I don’t get in and these don’t, we got to get… The best would be all three. Nothing will happen. All three. But they want to destroy the sanctity of the Supreme Court, the importance of the Supreme Court, the majesty of the Supreme Court. They’ll terminate religious liberty, cancel free speech, and force you to fund extreme late-term abortion. And there will be nothing to stop them. If they don’t get in, there’s going to be nothing to stop them. You have no idea how bad it will be. There will be nothing. I used to argue with certain people about the filibuster. I said, look, I don’t like it either, but I do it because I know they are going to do it. Everybody said, “Oh, they’ll never do it.” They’re doing it. They’ve already announced they’re going to do it. That means they can do anything they want. And the Republicans, they play a different game. I don’t know, maybe they love the country more. But they said, “No, no, they’ll never do it.” And I said, “Well Schumer, he’ll do it the first day he gets in, he’ll do it.” And that’s exactly what’s happening and he’ll do it. And he will do that to the Supreme Court, there’s no question. But they look forward to it because you know why? We put on three… Think of this, three great Justices and we’ll be over 300 federal judges in the United States, which will be a record. Three hundred, 300. And they don’t want to wait, they want to do it very quickly. “Let’s just vote and we’ll take it.” This takes years and years and years to slowly change a court and perhaps I got a little bit lucky to get three. A lot of presidents have had none. They’ve never had… They stay on for a long time, they’re young when they go on and they’re old when they come off. But the fact is a lot of presidents, good presidents, great presidents… They say you can’t be a great president unless you’ve put in Supreme Court Justice. They say it’s the single most important thing a president can do. And I’m not sure that’s right, I think military defense, military offense, frankly, is the most important thing. But it’s certainly one of the most important things you can do. And the fact that I have more than… I will have by the end, more than 300… First term, think of it. And if we do a second term, which I hope we do, we could have close to 540. But the fact that I had three Supreme Court Justices in the first term is not making them feel too good. They will unilaterally surrender to China. They’re already doing it. They’re already doing it. And Hunter made a lot of money in China. What’s he going to do? Sending our factories and our jobs overseas. They will raise your taxes. We lowered your taxes. We gave you the greatest tax decrease, tax cut, in the history of our country and they want to get rid of that and raise your taxes, and raise your regulations. We cut more regulations than any president in the history of our country. That’s one of the reasons our business came back. With the pandemic, as bad as it is, it’s horrible. Should have never happened. China allowed this to happen. Should have never happened. But we went down less. A lot of people don’t like to talk… Our economy. We went down less and we went up more than any other country in the world. We went down less because we had a good foundation. And yesterday again… So now I thought it was 48, it’s actually 128 times… Can you believe it? We set a new stock market record, but this one was great because the Dow Jones industrial average over… Think of this. Over 30,000 for the first time ever over the last couple of weeks. And yesterday it was 30,200. Can you believe this? And this is during hopefully what will be… We’re rounding the turn, we’re rounding the corner of the pandemic. But this is during a pandemic. We broke 30,000. A number that was unthinkable when I first came. When I first came in at around 16,000, the concept of hitting a 30,000 Dow was not even possible. And we not only hit we… Can you imagine if we didn’t get hit by this is freak? This total freak that came into our country, could you imagine if we didn’t get hit? And I of this before, David, in a way we did this sort of twice. We took it from the time I came in to the time we got hit and nobody’s blaming us for… Every country, 188 got hit. Some were totally devastated. I don’t know if they ever recover. But if you think about it, we had two. We did it the first time, we went up from where I took it over. Way up, then it went down. Then we had a second. So we really had two. And now we’re going to get money because we want the money. First of all, these States and cities should open up. They should open up. And we’re working hard against the Democrats, but we’re working hard to get some money out to the people because they need it. It’s not their fault that they got hit with something from China. And you notice the way the Democrats like to say it came from Italy? No, it came from China. And that’s okay to say it. They like to say it came from Europe. “No, actually, well specifically came from Italy.” Italy saying, “What did we do?” They’ll wage war on American energy. Absolutely decimating Georgia’s middle-class. Your bills will go up. Not a huge energy producer, but Texas…. Remember they said, “Trump will lose Texas by a lot.” I said, “Wait a minute. I’m in favor of energy. I’m the one that built… We have the greatest energy we’ve ever had. And it all happened this period of time. So you’re telling me, you’re telling me that I’m going to lose Texas to a guy that’s against fracking, against energy, against religion, and against guns.” You tell me that, I end up winning Texas by so much. Somebody said, “We don’t even know how much.” And we knew that before, but it’s fake news. They said Wisconsin. A poll came out. Washington Post, ABC, just before the election, I’m going to lose Wisconsin by 17 points. I said, “No, I’m going to win Wisconsin.” Well, actually I won Wisconsin. They’re trying to say he’s a little down. But I actually won. But that’s called suppression. That’s called a suppression poll. That’s a poll that’s so devastating, when I asked one of the pollsters, I said, “Why did they go so far? Why don’t they just say four or five?” “Because in four years they’re going to lose all respect. They don’t care. They’ll do anything to win. They’ll do anything to beat you. They don’t care.” These people are sick. Seventeen points. And we actually won. Remember so many of the States? I won every one of them. Every one of these States. And by the way, the swing States that we’re all fighting over now, I won them all by a lot. I won them all by a lot. And I have to say, if I lost I’d be a very gracious loser. If I lost, I would say I lost and I’d go to Florida, and I’d take it easy, and I’d go around and I’d say, “I did a good job.” But you can’t ever accept when they steal and rig and rob. You can’t accept it. Well, the Democrats did try to steal the presidency. They’re trying like hell. Do you ever notice the fake news? “Today he’s appointing his this, his that.” Sonny, his Secretary of Agriculture. Sonny. I liked Sonny. We want Sonny. He was a great governor here for eight years. Right? You would have solved this problem in about two hours, Sonny. He would have said, “Let the legislature open. Let the vote… Let us be transparent on signatures.” I think that’s okay. But we’re working hard to ensure that it doesn’t happen. And now they’re trying to steal these two important Senate seats from Georgia. These seats are the last line of defense to save America and protect all that we have accomplished. And we’ve accomplished things that no other president has accomplished, no other administration. And I did it with these two people. I didn’t know Kelly. When Kelly came in, I didn’t really know what to think. There is nobody that fought harder for me. And I have to tell you this… Do you mind if me tell you here publicly, is that okay? There is nobody… David understands this too. She fought. What a trooper. She was so tough and smart. She even went against Mitt Romney. She didn’t like Mitt Romney too much. I won’t say what she said, but it was tough. But she is… We call him Kryptonite. Anything he touches, they lose. But you were so great. And I’ll not forget it. And David’s been my friend for a long time, for a long, long time. And there’s nobody in Washington that’s more respected than David Perdue. There’s nobody. There’s nobody. So we have to keep them. If the other side manages to steal both elections, we will have total, one party, socialist control and everything you care about will be gone. Your whole philosophy is going to be gone. Joe Biden, Kamala… Kamala [inaudible 00:14:13]. Crying Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, they want to take away your guns. I never got it. I never got it. That’s one of the reasons I knew. How can you win? No oil, no guns. No God. Oh, they won. I don’t think so. Okay. I don’t think. We knew that a long time ago. They want to take away your jobs, take away your borders, take away your freedom, take away your religion. And they even want to take away your beautiful Christmas that we just got back. I have to be very careful. When I of imitate that, right? You remember I was saying suburban women. I say, “Suburban women, love me. Please love me. I’ve been so good to you. I’ve been so good to you.” I got rid of the worst regulation of the history of suburbia. I got rid of that regulation. So now you can actually have a house without a building going up next to it that you’re not going to be happy about, without crime increasing by tenfold and this and that. So I said, “But suburban women, please, please love me.” And CNN put me on. “Donald Trump. Donald Trump is begging. He’s begging and crying for the vote of suburban women. These people are sick. So you have to be very careful when you’re sarcastic. Sarcasm doesn’t work. Sarcasm doesn’t work with… Wow, that is a big group of people back there. Look at that. The fake news. Whoa. That’s a big group. That is a lot of fake news. Well, now we call it the fake news and suppression news. I use the word suppression because now they got a new thing going. This happened since Hunter, because we were killing them on Hunter, stealing money from every country. He was a human vacuum cleaner and it was hurting them badly. So all of a sudden big tech, together with their partner the Democrats, and their partner the fake news media, they decide under no circumstances will we ever talk about it again. So you have 95% of the media. You could have him be Jesse James and walk into the bank with a gun, hold them up, give me all your money, and they won’t talk about it. And it’s hard to have a scandal if they don’t talk about it. Other than the New York Post and people like Sean Hannity and people like Laura, and Tucker is doing good. I like Tucker lately. And our friends in the morning. And I tell you, we have some great new people. OAN. NewsMax. And Judge Jeanine, she’s on right? She’s on tonight. And Jesse Waters is great. And Pete Hexa. And I’m in trouble because I don’t mention everybody, but we have great people. We have a great voice, but the fact is most of the press was suppressed, so that no matter what they wouldn’t talk and it was incredible. And I have to give a lot of credit to Col Alan in the New York Post for what they did because they went out and they fought him and they fought them hard. Oldest paper in America, fourth or fifth biggest, and they should be very proud of themselves. But we’re doing the same thing. These two incredible people are doing the same thing. We fight. If you don’t get out and vote, they are going to win. Now, a lot of people, friends of mine say, “Let’s not vote. We’re not going to vote because we’re angry about the presidential…” And they’re friends of mine. There are people that are great people. They’re real friends. And more than just two, there are numerous people. And it’s almost like a protest. But if you do that, the radical left wins. Okay? It was sort of an instinct of mind. You’re angry because so many votes were stolen. It was taken away. And you say, “Well, we’re not going to do it.” We can’t do that. We have to actually do just the opposite. We can’t do that. We can’t do that. We have to do just the opposite. If you don’t vote, the socialists and the communists win. They win. Georgia Patriots must show up and vote for these two incredible people. And I’m telling you, they’re two of the finest people you’ll ever meet. We can fight for the presidency and fight to elect our two great senators and we can do it at the same time. We’ll do it at the same time, it’s all right. The election is about David Purdue, one of the greats. Kelly Leffler, a person who is just unbelievable. How she picked it up. There’s natural talent. As an athlete, I’d always say, “Would you rather practice or have natural talent?” I said, “The best is both right?” But she’s got a great natural talent, a great natural talent. Just very [inaudible 00:47:12]. But they believe, both of them, in America, and they believe in our values and all that we stand for. And they understand this state. They love your state. If they didn’t, I wouldn’t be here because I love you stay too, by the way. This election is about the radical left movement that hates America and wants to erase our history and wipe away everything that we hold dear. They want to rip down our statues. I signed a bill. I took an old bill because we could never get it today in the house headed by crazy Nancy. I took an old bill that said, “Ten years in prison.” They used the word prison, not jail. “Ten years in prison if you take down a statue.” I haven’t seen it happen lately. Do you notice? Everyone said you can’t use that. I’ll never forget. I heard they were going to… They did destruction around… And all in radical left, Democrat-run cities, by the way, and we’re not supposed to go in. If I had it to do again, I think I would have said the military in, if you want to know the truth. But we’re not supposed to. They’re supposed to be able to handle their own affairs. I don’t know. But all over, they said, “Sir, you can’t do this bill. This is too tough.” I said, “Really, they’re going to tear down a statue of Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson. Desecrate the most beautiful pieces of art… And they represent our country. And now they want to do it again. They want to put it in. I told you, we can’t let it happen.” Over the last four years, David Purdue has been one of the toughest fighters for our America First, America First agenda in Washington. And David saw this. Did you see last week? China said… China doesn’t like me too much. They pay us billions and billions. That never happened. Billions and billions of dollars in tariffs and they pay it, they devalued their currency. They paid a lot of money. They don’t like me. The happiest people in the world right now are the leaders of China, the second happiest or the leaders of Iran. What we would have done in the next four years, we would have been on a footing like nobody’s ever. And now we’re giving it all away. But China said, “We will not deal with you unless you get rid of the America First policy.” And you know what the Democrats said? They said, “Yes, we will do that.” Can you believe this? And that’s what I realized what a brilliant name that is. We come up with some good ones, but that’s a good one. We came up with plenty of good ones, haven’t we? Some of them I won’t use because some of those people are now friends of mine, but we came up with some good ones. But America First and I looked at Melania a week ago and I said, “Can you believe it? They are saying that they don’t agree with America First.” How do you say that? I mean, how do you say it? “We don’t agree with America first. We agree with China. Yes. We will get rid of America First policy.” I think David, you don’t like that too much. Right? And if they’re here, it won’t happen because nothing’s going to be able to get past that’s not going to be reasonable. He fought to pass the largest package, David, of tax cuts and reforms in American history. He helped lead the effort to repeal a record number of job killing regulations, the likes of which you’ve never seen, including the unfair Waters of the United States Rule that crippled work for our farmers and our builders. It’s such a beautiful name, but it was destroying people and I’ll never… Waters of the United… How beautiful is that? Waters of the United States. And I said, “I got to get rid of it. I got to do it, but I’m going to get killed.” Because the only thing good about it was the title. Waters. “What are you doing today?” “I’m terminating waters of the United States.” Well it was a little bit like the Paris Environmental Accord, right? The Paris Environmental Accord. I said, “I’m going to get killed in this one.” But we would have paid trillions and trillions of dollars. Russia has a big advantage of us. They go back to old days when the air was very dirty, that was their standard. China doesn’t kick in until 2030. We kick in immediately. And the money that would have cost us… And if we adhere to it, we would have had to close up 20% of our factories. And now the first thing they want to do… John Kerry, great negotiator. The first thing they want to do is, number one, they want to bring back the Paris Environmental Accord, which will cost us. That was designed to destroy the United States. The second thing they want to do is, let’s give Iran billions of dollars. Oh, they’re so happy. Iran would have been in my office in the first hour after we won the election to make a deal. But perhaps they still will. He said they still will. After hurricane Michael devastated our farmers in Southwest Georgia, as I said, no one worked harder to get them relief than David Perdue. He would call me all the time. He actually called me more than Sonny and Sonny’s at Agriculture. What the hell’s going on, Sonny? Sonny, what happened to you, Sonny? It’s true, David would call all the time. And remember how tough the Democrats meant. They didn’t want to give them anything. But we got it. We got them more than they even thought possible. Senator Purdue helped pass the unprecedented $2.5 trillion investment in our United States Military delivering the largest pay raises, in addition to everything else, for our warriors in a decade. And we now have the greatest, most modern military in the history of our country. We have brand new fighter jets, brand new bombers, brand new missiles and rockets, hypersonic missiles. We have hypersonic and hydro-sonic. You know what hydro-sonic is? Water. We have them all. We have missiles that go seven times faster than any missile in the world. And when we took over, our military was decimated, our military was tired, our military was in big trouble. And you remember and I’ve said it a lot. One of the world’s most overrated generals came to see me. He said, “Sir, we have no ammunition.” We had a little problem with a certain country. And he said, “Sir, we have no ammunition.” I said, “Tell me, you’re not saying that.” We didn’t have ammunition. Think of it. We had very little ammunition and I’ll never forget that statement. I said, “That should never happen to a president of the United States again nor should being spied on ever happened to a president of the United States again.” Senator Perdue has been a tremendous leader on pro-American immigration reform. Like nobody else. He voted very powerfully when I was going through hell on the wall. They would have given me anything. They gave me the money for the military. They just didn’t want to give me money for the wall. So I took it out of the military. What the hell could I do? That was rather good. It’s good to be a developer. Everyone said it was. That was the one where the judges ruled yesterday. So they said it was fine because I called it natural security. So we took it out of the… They didn’t figure that one out. Now they do. But you know what? They don’t have to be careful because it’s turned out to be very popular, very successful. Shut down sanctuary cities. End chain migration and protect American jobs, David did. He voted to confirm nearly 300 of the judges that I talked about. The federal judges that interpret the constitution is written. And when the Democrat mob came for judge Kavanaugh, David Purdue stood strong. And I’m just thinking, they both stood strong when they impeached your president for making a perfect phone call too. I’m the only president ever will never… That got impeached for making a perfect phone call. But those two were among the best. Senator Purdue is an outsider, a businessman, a great businessman, and a true American Patriot. You need him fighting for you and your family and your values because the United States Senate cannot be the same without him. So that’s why I’m here. I don’t do these things for other people. In fact, I was curious, I didn’t know if anyone was going to show up. I said, “I’m doing it for other people.” This is a hell of a crowd lift. As far as the eye can see. As far as the eye can see. I don’t like doing it for other people. I said, “David and Kelly called, would you do a rally?” I said, “Not really. I did 56 of them in a little tiny period of time.” I said, “Let me have…” And I said, when they asked I… It was really not. But I don’t do them for other people. It’s a lot of work to do a rally. A lot of work. People don’t realize. When you do… I did five a day, the last four or five days. One day I did six. Six. And the smallest one… Think of it, the smallest one. And the smallest one, think of it, the smallest one at 25,000 people, you think that’s fun? In some of them it’s 75 degrees and another it’s 20 degrees below zero and you’re doing them both. I’m saying, “How’s the weather out there?” “Sir, it’s about 20 degrees below zero.” That’s good. Then I land the next step, “How are we doing?” “Sir, it’s 82.” David’s opponent Jon Ossoff is a radical left wing zealot who is very proud to be endorsed by Bernie Sanders, crazy Bernie. Ossoff supports defunding the police, supports the crazy Green New Deal, that’s another beauty. Don’t forget, the Green New Neal is really $100 trillion, okay? It’s $100 trillion. They don’t say that, Louis, do they? Talk about 3 trillion? They got down to 3 trillion, no, it’s $100 trillion is what they wanted. That’s more money, if our economy was going unbelievable gangbusters for 100 years, no recession, no anything we couldn’t come close to making 100 trillion. They want to rip down buildings and rebuild them with no windows. I like windows, I like big, beautiful windows. He wants to do a total government takeover of healthcare that will destroy your doctor’s offices and rural hospitals. So if you are sick, if you have a cold go to a hospital, wait on line for about three days and hope you get a decent doctor. Ossoff also supports a crippling nationwide lockdown. He wants you to lock your home nice and tight after you’re inside of it and he passes legislation to let hardened criminals go free, get them out of jail, get them out of jail. Ossoff will be a complete tool for the radical left donors who are trying to buy Georgia Senate seats. You see the money these people have raised? I mean, well, of course I just raised $250 million and I should say. I didn’t raise it’s just… I said, how are we doing on that front? Because we didn’t get great publicity, boy, they were so happy these guys. You might not be happy in a few weeks, you might not. They were so happy. I said, “How’s fundraising going?” They said, “Sir, about 250 million.” I said, “250 million what?” “Dollars.” How the hell did that happen? Because people believe in what we’re doing, that’s why. They believe in what we’re doing. But that’s why Ossoff’s donations come from Silicon Valley, San Francisco and the other liberal places and they don’t come from Georgia. This is not your fault… I know you. You’re with me, I’m with you, we’ve always had wins from primers to two elections. We won two elections, believe it or not. I think I won the second one by more than I won the first one, I do, right? I won the second one by more. On January 5th you also need to vote for your incredible Republican Senator Kelly Loeffler. Kelly has been an exceptional champion for Georgia’s workers and families. And I know what they fight for. If I could tell you about David, I could tell you about Kelly, she fights for you every single day, loves you state. When our nation was hit with the China virus, Senator Loeffler helped rescue the U.S. economy by voting to pass a historic $3 trillion bill relief for American workers and families that a lot of people were against it and turned out to be a great thing. Kelly, thank you. A lot of people said, “Oh, it’s too much.” I said, “It’s not their fault that I want to get them more money now.” And I like the higher number rather than the lower number, we’ll make it back. With our help we secured $15 billion for 175,000 Georgia small businesses and saved 1.5 million Georgia jobs, that was both of them really, both of them. Kelly is a relentless advocate for Georgia farmers and she is for tirelessly to get them relief in this pandemic. And by the way her husband is a fine man who’s one of the most respected men in the country, I want to tell you that. I want to tell you that. He’s a great man, he’s a great gentleman. If you’re successful that it’s supposed to be a bad thing. No, I think it means you’re smart sometimes, right? He’s a smart guy but he’s a great guy, he’s a great man. At the urging of Kelly and David my administration took historic action to protect growers of Georgia blueberries, peppers, squash and cucumbers. Who does cucumbers around here? Because I like cucumbers. I’m the only one, I like cucumbers. When our law enforcement heroes were under attack Senator Loeffler stood up to the Marxists and introduced legislation to protect our brave men and women in blue and she was threatened all over the place. That threat meant nothing. That was a wasted number of phone calls or however the hell they threatened you, that was a waste of time. She also introduced legislation to prevent Democrat gun grabbers like Beto O’Rouke. Remember Beto? Beto. There’s a guy, here’s another one. He wants to take your guns away. Oh, by the way, Trump is going to lose Texas but Beto O’Rouke who’s a big factor of that all thing wants to take. Remember when Beto was running he was riding high and then Ted Cruz has done a great job, beat Beto O’Rouke. But Beto was riding high for a while. I remember he was on the cover of a certain really bad magazine, I won’t mention the name it’s failing. It won’t be in business for another six months, I don’t think, I hope. But he was on the cover and he said, “I was born to do this.” And I said, “Anybody that says they were born to do this they’re going to be losing very quickly.” And you know what? Within about two months he was a stone cold loser. And just weeks ago Senator Loeffler her vote to confirm our newest Supreme Court Justice, Amy Coney Barrett. They both did by the way, they both did. I can’t leave David out of that one. Kelly’s opponent, Raphael Warnock is a dangerous extremist who is radically opposed to your values. He said he believes that, “Nobody can serve God and the military.” Oh, really? An appalling statement that dishonors the memory and generations of American heroes who fought for God and for our country. Raphael Warnock has openly declared his support for socialism and he is even praised Marxists all over the world. He once hosted the barbaric communist dictator, Fidel Castro. He likes Castro, he thinks he was a good man. “He was a good guy,” he said. He falsely slandered patriotic Americans as racist. He called police officers gangsters, thugs, and bullies. He supports abolishing cash bail. Look at what happened to New York with their cash bail, no cash bail. Don’t bail, don’t worry about it. You killed somebody, don’t worry about it you’re on the honor code. And he’s declared, “Open up the jails.” Free the violent criminals and prey on Georgia families, children. Now you can’t do that. This is not for Georgia, yeah, I’m telling you. It might be for some places that I tell you that too, this is not for Georgia. I think Raphael has to move to another state. Try it again. Warnock is strongly anti-Israel and Warnock’s own writings make clear that he believes America is a sinister nation that must be punished. Don’t just take my word for it. We did something, I shouldn’t be doing this for them, of course it’s too much money but we’ll do it anyway. We have a little video to play, please. So we had, I just looked at that one scene because it was in Washington and we had about a month ago incredible crowds of people. They were angry as hell at the election and they showed up and it was incredible, there were hundreds of thousands of people, people couldn’t believe. Now, of course some of the fake news said, “Hundreds of people.” Again, no, no, tens of thousands of people. And Antifa, Antifa showed up. Not the right but the left showed up and they looked at some of these people and they wanted to attack the crowd. They looked and they said, “No, thank you,” and they left. No problem. They looked at some of these people they said, “No, thank you.” Then it broke up about three o’clock, everyone went home very peacefully, it was a beautiful day, actually. They all went home peacefully. And that night they came back and there were a few families that stayed around with young children and there were some elderly people that were having dinner in Washington, very elderly people. And they got attacked, those people got attacked viciously by the scum from Antifa. We can’t let this happen, we can’t let this happen. But what they didn’t play, what the fake news didn’t play is during the day they walked in and they wanted to do some damage and they took a look and they said, “No, thank you, we won’t do it. We’ll wait. We’ll wait till we get the people with the children. We’ll wait till we get the elderly people that want to stay in Washington and really just have a good time.” And it was disgusting to watch. On January 5th, you must defeat Ossoff and Warnock and send two great people, David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler back to the Senate. And if you don’t mind I’d like to ask David and Kelly to come up and say a few words, please. Thank you very much. Thank you. Well, thank you very much. Thank you both. Thank you, thank you. We’re fighting, we’re going to fight like you never saw before, thank you. We can’t let what happened three weeks ago, we can’t let it happen. Note, it’s beyond me. We can’t let it happen. And somewhere there’s going to be a champion, you’re a champion, somewhere there’s going to be a champion that’s going to do what’s right. Because this has been going on for a long time, but never like it’s happened recently. And they’ve used the pandemic and the phony fake ballots, the mail-in ballots, they used that to sabotage our country. We’re not going to let it happen. As you know a major issue in this state is voter fraud, it’s been a big issue for a long time but never like this. We sent out tens of thousands, millions and millions of ballots. Nobody knew where they came from, where they are, people were getting two, three, four ballots. They were signing them, sending them in, what a mess. And I said it a year ago and I said it every month and I even said, “Let’s postpone the election,” and they said, “Oh, he’s not at American.” They knew what they were doing. They knew what they were doing. Were all deeply disturbed and upset by the lying, cheating, robbing, stealing that’s gone on with our elections. We know the Democrats will have dead people voting and you got to watch it, dead people. You wouldn’t believe how many illegal aliens from out of the state and they’ll be filing out and filling out ballots for people who don’t even exist. They put up names, they have people signing their own name over and over. They have people signing names with the same pen, with the same signature. They don’t even change because they know once they get it in it’ll never be looked at, it’ll never be looked at again because of people like your secretary of state and your governor. So we want signature verification but the answer… And we’re going to be very careful, we’re going to watch every ballot, David and Kelly, we can’t let this happen again. And again we have more light shining here because of what happened and because of the fact it’s pinpointed. The answer to the Democrat fraud is not stay at home, that’s what Nancy Pelosi and Schumer, that’s what they want you to do, stay at home, just stay at home. If you want to do something to them, I don’t want to use the word revenge, but it is a certain revenge to the Democrats. You show up and vote in record numbers, that’s what you have to do. They can only win if they cheat, they can’t win this state unless they cheat and they cheat better than anybody. When you think it the Republicans are much nicer. They’re not nearly as vicious, maybe a few of us. “Republicans are too nice,” she said. You’re right. That’s a very good.. Thank you very much, I like that. But they are, they’re too nice. They don’t go after these criminals, they got to go after them. We’re talking to people, “Go after them,” they don’t go after them. They’re afraid they’ll hurt their reputation when they get out, I don’t know, they don’t go after them. But we’re watching this so closely, we have everybody watching. You got to get out and vote. Let them steal Georgia again you’ll never be able to look yourself in the mirror. We have to hold the line and you have two of the greatest people in earth so we have to hold the line. Make sure that you and everyone else know that you have to register to vote before this Monday, December 7th, is that right? Monday, December 7th, you have to register to vote. Of course, you’ll probably be allowed to if you’re a Democrat, they don’t have any time limit. Did you see where Stacey is allowed to harvest but other people can’t harvest. How is that constitutional? How is that constitutional? Has anybody looked at that? Go to georgia.gov and register immediately then request your absentee ballot before December 31st. Don’t delay, watch it closely. Do it today, do it tomorrow and return your ballot the same day you get it. So they can’t say, “Gee, it didn’t come in on time.” You know what they did it in one of the states? Ballots were coming in late, very, very late so they backdated the ballots. We have all the information, we have so much evidence. And then you go to a court, “Oh, they don’t have enough evidence.” We have hundreds and hundreds and even thousands of affidavits. And they say, “Oh, he doesn’t have the evidence.” We have so much evidence we don’t know what to do with it. I’m saying, “Do we put all of this into a file?” Again it’s like with wheelbarrows. If you aren’t planning to vote by mail, vote early in person or vote on election day. Whatever you do I need each of you, every one of you, your friends, your family to go and vote. And after we win we need to pass landmark election reform including voter ID, is that so bad? Residency verification, like we live in the country, we live in this state. Citizenship confirmation. They want to say, “Oh, he doesn’t have to be a citizen.” You got to see what’s voting… They’re not citizens. “You’re a citizen?” “No, I’m not citizen.” “You speak English?” No, no English. I speak, no English.” “Oh, you’re voting?” “Yeah.” This is the craziest thing. The Democrat National Committee had their convention. And they had a picture, you couldn’t get in unless you had a picture, you had a photo ID. But when it comes to the most important thing voting they don’t want to do it. And they know, they know exactly. We just can’t let that happen. I’ve only been doing this for short time. Believe me this is something we’re going to do because we can’t allow it to happen. And complete overhaul of our election security systems because right now Dominion is a joke, okay? Not a very funny joke. It’s a disgrace that in 2020 no state in America even makes any real attempt to verify that those who cast ballots by mail are eligible and lawfully registered voters. The evidence of fraud is overwhelming and again, I’m going to ask you to look up at that very, very powerful and very expensive screen. I do this for a few people, let’s go. So if you just take the crime of what those Democrat workers were doing, and by the way, there was no water main break. You know they said… there was no water main break. That’s 10 times more than I need to win this state, 10 times more. It’s 10 times maybe more than that, but it’s 10 times more because we lost by a very close number. The alleged Biden margin of victory in several states is entirely accounted for by extraordinarily large midnight vote dumps. You saw them going up to the sky, all extremely skewed to Biden. Like, Biden would get 10,000 votes and Trump would get three in a Trump area. Oh. For, example, at 6:31 AM in Michigan, reported 141,238 votes for Joe Biden and 5,900 votes for Donald Trump. 96% for Biden, 4% for Trump in an area where I should be doing quite well. You know, I won almost every county in Michigan, almost every district, except for one. And they actually had more people, if you look at the ballots, they had ballots all over. They had more ballots than they had people voting. How do you do that? So they had people and they’re voting, and then as you know, two of the canvassers were very brave. They didn’t vote, and they got the hell knocked out of them from the standpoint of what they went through. All the cameras went off and then they raised their hand, but then they couldn’t sign it ultimately, but more ballots than they had voters. Now, how simple is that? A similar vote dump occurred in Wisconsin at 3:42 AM. This is 3:42 in the morning. In fact, when I went to bed that night, everybody was calling, “Congratulations. You’re up 600,000 votes in Pennsylvania.” Across all of the key swing states, there were impossibly low rejection rates, you saw that, for mail-in ballots, drastically less than the historic norm. In Georgia 0.5% of the mail-in ballots were rejected in 2020 compared to 5.77%. That’s a difference of 11 times more. It’s hundreds of thousands of votes. In Pennsylvania, 0.03% were rejected in 2020 compared to a much, much higher percentage in 2016. This issue alone is enough to change the election results in many states. Whistleblowers. And that’s the smallest of the issues, whistleblowers in multiple states have testified to witnessing postal workers and election workers illegally backdating thousands and thousands of ballots, fixing ballots, filling out false birthdays, registering ineligible voters, and much, much more. We’re talking about hundreds of thousands of votes in each state. In Arizona, a sample of 100 ballots reviewed by a judge found that a very small percentage of these ballots, very small, but when you look at it, it was turned out to be very large, it was tens of thousands of votes, more than we would have needed to win Arizona. We should have won that state very easily. We have a similar type of governor, I think, but I’ll let you know that in about a week. In one Michigan county, and by the way, when Laura Ingram interviewed your governor, he said he was an offensive lineman. I said, “That’s strange. He doesn’t look like an offensive lineman to me.” In one Michigan county using Dominion voting systems, nearly 6,000 votes were discovered that were wrongly switched from Trump to Biden. They called it a glitch. You know a glitch? Just like the machine broke. Numerous times we found glitches, and every single time, the glitch went a hundred percent to Biden and no percent to Trump. The same systems are used in 30 states. The left lies, they cheat and they steal. They are ruthless and they are hellbent on getting power and control by any means necessary. They investigate you and they prosecute you. The moment you question them, they try and intimidate you. They call you a poor American. You’re not a good American. You don’t love our country. They don’t love our country. They beat you down, shut you up and make you retreat. That’s what they do. That’s what they’ve done to your governor. They’ve done that to your governor. Your governor should be ashamed of himself. That’s what they want to do right here in Georgia. They want you to be quiet. They want you to go away, but we don’t go away. We don’t go. It’s the biggest open secret in America that Democrats cheat in elections, this year by sending out 65 million mail-in ballots. They perpetrated the largest fraud in the history of our country. Democrat officials and politicians in every swing state, systematically weakened every measure to combat election fraud. They ensured that there were no identity checks, no signature checks. “I want to check a signature, please.” “I’m sorry. We don’t let you do that.” No eligibility checks, no nothing. Every single one of you know that if these ballots are properly audited, if the signatures and envelopes were examined, if the envelopes were correlated to the votes, because you’ll find there are far more ballots than there are envelopes, all you have to do is count them up. How many ballots do you have? How many envelopes do you have? And if the voter rolls are studied, in other words, studied to check the signature. “Ms. Smith. Oh, it’s a totally different signature from 2 years ago, from 6 years ago, from 10 years ago. What’s that all about?” We will find that hundreds of thousands of ballots were illegally cast in your state and all over the country, by the way, more than enough to give us a total historic victory. This is our country that they are… and you know this and you see it, but they’re trying to take it from us through rigging, fraud, deception, and deceit. That’s what we saw in the election. That’s what’s going on, and it’s happening right now in our country. We will do something about it, and we’re going to do something about it quickly. We’re going to be watching on January 5th, we’re going to be watching every element of what they do. This fraud that they perpetrated on our country, we’re going to be watching it more closely than any election has ever been watched. Hopefully, our legislatures and the United States Supreme Court will step forward and save our country. I used to say, “Without borders, we don’t have a country.” I can say also without an honest voting system, without an electoral process that works and that’s honest and fair, we don’t have a country either. We need to check every single signature in the presidential and senatorial elections. Right now, we have to get out to vote for David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler to show the radical left that we will never surrender, we will only win. We’re going to win. We always win. Somehow we find a way to win. Now, is not the time to retreat. Now is the time to fight harder than ever before. So don’t listen to my friends. Just go out, just go out. And you know what they’re saying? They’re saying, “We want you to fix the system.” We’re going to fix the system, but the system will be fixed when these people get in. They’ll get in and we’ll fix this system because we’re all victims. Everybody here, all these thousands of people here tonight, they’re all victims, every one of you. The next great victory for our movement begins right here on January 5th. Then we are going to win back the White House. We’re going to win it back. We’re going to take back the house in 2022, and then in 2024. And hopefully I won’t have to be a candidate, we’re going to win back the White House again. A friend of mine said, “Oh, don’t worry about it, sir. You’re way up in the polls. You’ll win in 2024.” I said, “I don’t want to wait until 2024. I want to go back three weeks.” We’re thrilled to be joined tonight by some real friends of all of ours, Representatives Doug Collins. It was fantastic, and by the way, I’ve got to tell you. As you know, he and Kelly had a great primary, a very strong primary. They both did fantastically well, and he is on board and he is one of the greatest advocates I’ve ever met in Washington. I want to thank Doug Collins. Where’s Doug? Thank you, Doug. What a job he does. Thank you. Doug, you want to run for governor in two years [inaudible 01:33:45]? Yeah. Good-looking governor. A friend of mine, one of the toughest guys you’ll ever see, Louie Gohmert of Texas. Louie. Thank you Louie. Thank you, Louie. And a young up-and-comer who’s taken Washington by storm, Dan Crenshaw. Where’s Dan? Where’s Dan? Where is Dan? I didn’t see you, Dan. The first time that’s ever happened to me. Yeah, because you do stand out in many ways. Thank you very much, San. The next Senator from Tennessee just got elected. Did my endorsement help? Ah? Better believe it. We love Tennessee. Bill Haggerty. He’s going to be a great Senator. He’s going to be a great senator for a long time. You’re a former eight-year governor. He only left because of a thing called term limits. If I would’ve known, I would’ve tried to end those term limits, but he went to the Department of Agriculture as his head. He’s done a tremendous job. We’ve handed out $28 billion to farmers, 28 billion. I said, how badly have we been targeted by China? And Sonny produced that over a two-year period, sir. $28 billion. That’s when I put the tariffs on China, took the money and gave it out to the farmers. And we had a lot of money left over and we put that into the U.S. treasury, right Sonny? You’ve done a fantastic job. He knows more about farms than any human being. State representative. A friend of mine, and great gentleman. He saw what was happening. He happens to be a Democrat, but we love him. I’m trying to talk him into joining our party. Vernon Jones. [inaudible 01:35:36]. Thank you Vernon. What a great guy. Agriculture commissioner, Gary Black. Gary, good job you’re doing. Boy, what a good reputation. Thank you very much, Gary. Your Public Service Commission’s Tricia Pridemore, Jason Shaw and a great man. Great, great man who’s also on the ballot next month. Bubba McDonald. I like that name. Where’s Bubba? Great, great job. Great job. That’s great. Thanks a lot, Bubba. And I introduce you to Bert Jones. Bert’s going to be a very important man, I think, over the next coming with William and Brandon and the folks and I appreciate it. And Greg, thank you very much for being here. We appreciate it very much. Very important. Georgia Republican Party Chairman, David Shafer. David. Hi David, how are we doing, David? We’ll fire you so fast if we don’t. Now, David’s done a great, great job, and he works very closely with RMC chairwoman. This is how we won. We won a great state. We won a great state known as Michigan when she was there. And I said, “Let’s bring her to Washington.” Ronna McDaniel. Thank you, Ronna. Thank you. Thank you, Rona. Over the last four years, we’ve built the greatest political movement in the history of our country. Already, we’ve achieved more than anyone thought possible and we’re just getting started and we don’t want other people to rip it apart. We must reelect Kelly and David to keep it going for decades. Our politicians spent trillions and trillions of dollars rebuilding other foreign nations, fighting foreign wars and defending foreign borders. We want to defend our border if it’s okay. And we’re now finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities, and we are bringing our jobs, our factories, and our troops back home to the USA where they belong, thank you. Bringing them home. Not easy to bring them home. I bring them home, and they say, “Well, Sir, we got to keep them there, sir. We got to keep spending money.” We got to keep giving money to these countries that can’t stand us, that nobody ever heard of-in everything we do, we are putting America first. We ended the war on American energy and the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere on earth. We achieved the most secure border in U.S. history, and we built our wall, as I say. Very important for you because you’re a big military between the equipment we build and VA choice and VA accountability, right? You ever notice the vets? We used to always have… On television, you’d have the fake news, they’d always be… Well in that case, it wasn’t fake, but for years, you’d always see vets how badly treated they were, how badly treated. I shouldn’t say this because they’ll find one somewhere in the country, but you don’t see that. You don’t see that anymore. You don’t see the stories on the evening news about vets that are being treated horribly. And accountability was a big factor. We fired 9,000 horrible people that took advantage of our vets, and they’re gone. Now if our vets don’t get good service, they go out, they see a doctor. We pay the bill, they get better. They don’t wait in line for weeks and months. We destroyed 100% of the ISIS caliphate in Iraq and Syria. We killed the leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi and we eliminated the world’s top terrorist, Soleimani is dead. I withdrew from the last administration’s disastrous Iran nuclear deal, and I think they want to start it up again. Can you believe this? I wonder if they’ll give him 150 billion. No, they’ll give him 250. They were ready to rock. They were ready to do whatever we wanted. Now they’re going to… they’re salivating. I recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem, and also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Instead of endless war, we are forging peace all over the world. And you know, we have the greatest military ever. We have the greatest equipment, all made in the USA. A lot of it made in Georgia, but you know what? I’m the only one in many, many decades that hasn’t started a war. Everyone thought that with my personality, I’d be in war the first week. They were all saying war, and we developed relationships. Let’s see how he would do with Kim Jong-un of North Korea. I don’t think too well, but whatever happened to that? Remember I came in, it was going to be war with North Korea. It was going to be war with everybody. Now, we built the greatest military in the world and the better it is, the less likely it is that we’re going to have to use it. But everything that we’ve achieved together is on the line on June 5th. And this election, you can send a message to the fake news media, and there’s a lot of them right back there. They’ll find something wrong with this evening. I don’t know what it is, but they’ll find something wrong. Maybe it was the person that shouted love. They’ll say I was a horrible protester. They’ll find something. Kelly and David, they’re going to find something. They’re looking and having a hard time. It’s been a love fest. This is a love fest for these two people. But they all want the Silicon Valley sensors and the corrupt Democrat political machine. They’re partners. You must vote for David Perdue and Kelly Leffler. Go out and vote. With your help, we are going to continue our mission to save America. We will defend the right to life, religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms. They’re going to take your guns away. We will always support the heroes of law enforcement. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might, and we will preserve peace through strength. We will protect social security and Medicare, and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and children, and restore a patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. We will live by the words of our national motto, In God We Trust. From Atlanta to Augusta, from Savannah to Columbus and from Athens to right here, right here, this is a nice place. It’s a nice place, Valdosta. We inherit the legacy of generations of American patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears to defend our country and our freedom. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, laid down the railroads, raised up the great skyscrapers, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America into the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And if they get in, and add me into the group, if you don’t mind, we will be greater than ever before without question. The best is yet to come. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. Our fight to drain the Washington swamp and reclaim America’s destiny has just begun. We will not bend. We will not break. We will not yield. We will never give in. We will never give up and we will never back down. We will never, ever surrender because we are Americans and our hearts bleed red, white, and blue. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of Georgia, we have made America powerful again. They’ve done it. We have made America wealthy again. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again. We have made America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Georgia. Get out and vote, get out and vote.

"116","12-07-20","We present our nation’s highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom to one of the greatest wrestlers in American history, Iowa legend, Dan Gable. He has been an incredible inspiration to so many people. We’re joined today by Dan’s wonderful wife, Kathy, and they’re incredible and large family, including 13 grandchildren. Thank you very much. Thank you Kathy, very much. It’s a great honor for us too. Thank you for being here. We’re also joined by Iowa senators, Chuck Grassley. Where’s Chuck? Chuck, congratulations on everything. Chuck and Joni Ernst, who just had a big victory. Thank you, Joni. What a job, what a job. They had you down a couple of points and you won by a lot. It’s one of those things that you really, you should be very proud of yourself. You campaigned hard, and that was a tremendous victory. Thank you very much. Also, representatives Jim Jordan. Where’s Jim? A great wrestler, a really great wrestler. I won’t go over the record because the only way you’re not great is compared to this guy, perhaps, but he’s a warrior in every way and we appreciate you being here and Markwayne Mullin. Thank you very much for being here and I’m glad your son is doing well and setting records also. These two guys are great. They’re really, really fantastic people. Dan was born and raised in the working class town of Waterloo, Iowa. His mother said she knew Dan would be a wrestler the day they brought him home from the hospital. Even as an infant, Dan refused to let his back even touch the ground. That’s sort of an interesting statement, probably so. At four years old, his parents sent him to the local YMCA where he learned to swim, wrestle, and play football. When he reached high school, Dan decided to commit himself entirely to wrestling. His coach quickly saw his unmatched intensity and gave Dan the keys to the gym so he could come first thing in the morning to practice. At first, Dan was alone, but as he achieved one victory after another, the rest of the team followed his lead. He worked hard, but he was also born with something very special. It’s called talent, and talent, you either have it or you don’t. During his time in high school, Dan’s beloved sister, Diane, toughest time in his life was murdered. Afterwards, Dan poured even more of his energy into wrestling and his exceptional success brought happiness and pride to his family, especially in overcoming this incredible heartbreak that they had with what happened to Diane. As a high school wrestler, Dan went 64 and zero, not losing a single match. I have to say, Jim Jordan told me all about, I knew all about Dan, but he told me things that are pretty amazing, right, Jim? Pretty amazing. Dan then attended Iowa State where he secured two NCAA wrestling championships, National Wrestling Championships, three Big Eight titles and became a three-time All-American. He won 117 consecutive matches and lost only one. Well, in politics I won two, so I’m two and O and that’s pretty good too, but we’ll see how that turns out. After that lone defeat, Dan vowed that it wasn’t going to happen again. He couldn’t stand the feeling of losing a match. He rededicated himself to mastering the sport and soon adapted his wrestling style to reach new heights of greatness. Sports Illustrated labeled Dan the hardest working athlete in the world by far, and detailed his rigorous routine of working out two to three times a day, every single day of the week. They estimated the Dan produced 60 pounds of sweat every seven days. That’s a lot. I’m not sure I want to hear about it, but that’s a lot. That’s a lot of work. In his pursuit of perfection, Dan suffered multiple injuries. His nose, multiple fingers were broken and his feet were very tough stuff. He pushed every single muscle to the absolute limit. Nobody’s ever done it like him, but his unwavering grit and focus, it propelled him forward through all of that adversity, tremendous adversity. Before matches, Dan would repeat the words, “Cakes, carries, ducks, picks, shucks, sweeps,” over and over again. I have to ask Dan, why, why Dan? Oh wow. That’s pretty good. Wow. Well, you did the … Whatever it was. You did the right thing. He had only two things in mind, scoring and dominating. In the midst of the Cold War, he was selected to represent team USA at the 1972 Munich Olympics. The leader of the Soviet wrestling team proclaimed that he would search the USSR and find a wrestler that would defeat Dan Gable. That was his big ambition, and they found somebody that was considered one of the greatest anywhere in the world, but they failed. Dan won every match and did not give up a single point. How many matches in the Olympics, Dan?. You won every match and you didn’t give up a point? That’s a record. That’s a record I think that still stands. To do that, did the Russian in the final did not get a point? What did you win that one by? That’s okay. That’s pretty good. What do you think, Jim? Have you ever heard of when you go six matches and don’t give up a point against great talent? You watched it, right? That’s amazing. To me, that’s amazing. Not giving up a single point. He toppled Soviet preeminence in the sport at that time. Russia’s, they had the greatest wrestlers in the world they thought, except for Dan. They sort of felt they couldn’t beat him. Defeated their wrestler in that final match and took home the Olympic gold medal. As a wrestler, Dan said a pin streak record of 25 consecutive pins. Now, I’m larger than you a little bit. You think I could take you in wrestling? Huh? Would I have a big advantage? What do you think? I agree. Do you agree with that, John? I do. I agree. He’s the expert. That is held to this day, 25 consecutive pins. He was also the first American to win consecutive world at Olympic titles. Dan went on to coach at the University of Iowa where he secured 355 victories and 15 NCAA team titles. Jim Jordan told me that he was the greatest wrestler ever, but he may have been a better coach, right Jim? Now, has any team in any sport ever won 15 NCAA team titles because I don’t know. I mean, I think that’s a lot that’s more than UCLA in basketball, right? I don’t know if it has any … Jim? I don’t think so. I think it’s incredible. His team scored an average of 17 victories for every loss and he was named the University of Iowa’s all-time winning winningest coach. I think probably … You look all over the country. It would be the all-time winningest coach, so that’s incredible, 15 NCAA titles. As a coach, Dan has trained, guided and mentored 152 All-American athletes, 106 Big 10 champions, 45 national champions and 12 Olympians. He was also the head coach of three US Olympic teams. Dan has said, quote, “I never jumped for joy as a player, but I always jumped for joy as a coach.” Other words, he did his job, but he was really rooting for those other people to do theirs. That’s great, Dan. It’s a great statement. Dan has been inducted into the USA Wrestling Hall of Fame, the United States Olympic Hall of Fame, the National Wrestling Hall of Fame, and the United World Wrestling Hall of Fame. In 2013, he helped ensure that wrestling remained a very important top Olympic sport. The National Wrestling Hall of Fame has built a Dan Gable Museum in Dan’s hometown. A permanent reminder of the incredible journey that started in the great state Iowa. I love Iowa. I love Iowa and I knew those polls were wrong. They had me losing Iowa, Dan, and we won Iowa by a lot. There were a lot of polls that were wrong. I love that state. No one has done more to promote wrestling in America than Dan Gable. He’s an athletic giant who conquered one the most difficult in ancient sports in the world. He’s the greatest wrestler probably ever. We’ve never had anybody like him. He’s made our country very proud and he is a true goat. You know what goat is, goat? Greatest of all time, right? He’s the greatest of all time. Today, in recognition of his really exceptional achievements, Dan will become the first wrestler in history to receive this, our most important award, along with the Congressional Medal of Honor. I would now like to ask the military aid to step forward to present Coach Dan Gable with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, but before doing that, I’d like to have Dan say a few words, please. Thank you, Dan, please. You take your time. Thank you. Come on over here and we’ll do it over here. Congratulations, everybody. Here we go. Put that here. Thank you very much. I’m very proud of you, as a nation, and thank you for doing such a great job. We appreciate it. Do you have any questions for Dan? John, for Dan. Yeah, we’re very proud of you, Dan. Thank you very much. Thank you very much everybody, we appreciate it. I heard he is doing well. I just spoke to him. He is doing very well, no temperature. He actually called me early this morning. He was the first call I got. Now, he’s doing very well. That’s another champion, greatest mayor in the history of New York. What he’s doing now is more important. He will admit that. He was the greatest mayor, did a fantastic job, especially when you see what’s going on nowadays, Dan. Rudy Giuliani was a great, great mayor and what he’s doing now, and he will say it is even more important. Well, I think the case already been made. If you look at the polls, it was a rigged election. You look at the different states, the election was totally rigged. It’s a disgrace to our country. It’s like a third world country. These ballots pouring in from everywhere using machinery that nobody knows, ownership nobody knows anything about. They have glitches as they call them. Glitches, with glitches, who aren’t glitches. They got caught sending out thousands of votes all against me, by the way. Now, this was like from a third world nation. I think the case has been made and now we find out what we can do about it, but you’ll see a lot of big things happening over the next couple of days. Very importantly, we’re here for a different reason. We’re here to present our highest achievement, really something that really speaks to such incredible achievement to a man who really is a great man and a great figure in sports, not just wrestling, in sports, one of our greatest athletes of all time. I just want to say it’s an honor to be with you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you everybody. Appreciate it. Thank you very much, Dan.

"117","12-08-20","Thank you very much. Appreciate it very much. I’m honored to welcome doctors, scientists, industry executives, and state and local leaders to our historic Operation Warp Speed Vaccine Summit. It’s been some journey for all of us. It’s been an incredible success. We’re grateful to be joined by Vice President Mike Pence who has done an absolutely incredible job on the coronavirus task force. Mike, thank you. Stand up, Mike. Great job. We’re here to discuss a monumental national achievement. From the instant the coronavirus invaded our shores, we raced into action to develop a safe and effective vaccine at breakneck speed. It would normally take five years, six years, seven years, or even more. In order to achieve this goal, we harnessed the full power of government, the genius of American scientists and the might of American industry to save millions and millions of lives all over the world. We’re just days away from authorization from the FDA and we’re pushing them hard, at which point we will immediately begin mass distribution. Before Operation Warp Speed, the typical timeframe for development, an approval as you know, could be infinity. And we were very, very happy that we were able to get things done at a level that nobody has ever seen before. The gold standard vaccine has been done in less than nine months. On behalf of the entire nation, I want to thank everyone here today who has been involved in this extraordinary American initiative. I also want to recognize members of my administration who have worked tirelessly in this effort. Alex Azar, please, Alex. Where’s Alex? Thank you, Alex. Great job. Moncef Slaoui, where are you, Moncef? Thank you very much. Great job. A man who’s now going to be very important, General Gus Perna, I have no doubt about it. Right? Logistic. Jared Kushner, who’s worked so hard. Where’s Jared? Jared, wherever you may be, thank you. Thank you, Jared. Dr. Deborah Birx. Deborah, thank you very much, Deborah. Admiral Brett Giroir. Where is Brett? Great job you’ve been doing, Brett. Surgeon General, Jerome Adams. Jerome, thank you very much. Terrific. Dr. Robert Redfield, Robert, thank you very much. Appreciate it. Administrator Seema Verma, Seema, thank you. Dr. Peter Marks, Peter, where’s Peter? Thank you. Paul Mango, Adam Bowler and Brad Smith. Thank you very much. Great job. Thank you all very much. Incredible job. And many others also, many, many others. We’re also grateful to be joined by Governors Greg Abbott, where is Greg? Bill Lee, Bill. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Bill. Ron DeSantis, Ron, thank you, Ron. Thank you. Thank you very much. Great job, Ron. And John Bel Edwards, John Bel, thank you. Thank you, John Bel. Thank you very much. As well as Senator John Barrasso who’s a fantastic doctor also, by the way. I have to say. When I need info on that subject, I call up John. Thank you, John, very much. Senator Steve Daines, congratulations on a great win, great win. That was easier than you thought it turned out, right? It was a little easier than you thought. Great going. We’re proud of you. Congressman Greg Walden, Greg. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. And Congressmen Brad Wenstrup. Thank you, Brad. Great job, and many, many others. My administration provided a total of $14 billion to accelerate vaccine development and to manufacture all of the top candidates in advance, long in advance. As a result of this unprecedented investment, we are exceedingly proud that both Pfizer and Moderna have announced that their vaccines are approximately 95% effective which is a number that nobody expected to be able to get to, far exceeding anything that really that anybody thought. We went out and we said, “What do you think a maximum would be?” And I think, doctors, we all came up to the conclusion that something like that would be really incredible. We have other candidates looking right now and we have some big ones that we’re going to be announcing very soon. We have some companies, great, great companies out there you all know about, Johnson and Johnson and others. And they’re all coming in and they’re coming in very quickly. We expect to have some news on that very shortly. And we have worked very well with the companies, but if for any reason we have any problems, we will be instituting the Defense Production Act and we will make sure that we don’t have any problems for very long. We’ve instituted it before. Two additional companies, AstraZeneca and Johnson and Johnson. As you know, the Johnson and Johnson is a one dose, one shot vaccine, so we’re going to see how that works. That would be very helpful if that all came out, and I think it probably will. Also, they’re showing tremendous, tremendous promise, all of them, tremendous problem. We’re very hopeful that the FDA will authorize the Pfizer vaccine within days. We’ve got to get it moving and Moderna vaccine almost immediately thereafter. Large numbers of tests and samples have been done so hopefully that’ll go very quickly. If authorized, tens of millions of vaccine doses will be available this month and we’ll get it distributed very quickly. We have that all set and hundreds of millions more will quickly follow. Every American who wants the vaccine will be able to get the vaccine. And we think by spring, we’re going to be in a position that nobody would have believed possible just a few months ago. Amazing, really amazing. They say it’s somewhat of a miracle. And I think that’s true. The plan we put forward prioritizes the elderly and patients with underlying conditions, as well as health care workers and first responders. The ultimate decision rests with the governors of the various states. And I hope the governors make wise decisions who will decide where the vaccines will go in their state and who will get them first. We urge the governors to put America’s seniors first, and also I think those who work with seniors, which obviously you going to have to do that. I think they have to go together, and doctors, nurses, first responders, et cetera. This will quickly and dramatically reduce deaths and hospitalizations. And within a short period of time, I think we want to get back to normal. It’s a very standard phrase. We want to just get back to normal, get back to where we were a little more than nine months ago. We’re doing incredibly. And in many respects, we’re still doing incredibly with our stock markets and everything else which are hitting all new highs. We’ve already finalized a partnership with Walgreens and CVS whose executives join us today. Thank you very much for being here. Thank you very much. We appreciate it very much. And they will deliver vaccines directly to nursing homes as soon as the states request that they do so. Later today, General Gus Perna will outline the detailed plan to rapidly distribute the vaccine to every state territory and tribe. States have designated over 50,000 sites that will receive the vaccine. We’ve worked very closely with the states. Actually, we’ve had very good relationships with the governors. I almost think all of the governors, at least in those conference calls that are somewhat secret, other than sometimes on occasion, Mike. The press will break in which is fine, too. It’s amazing how you leave those rooms and about 10 seconds later. There wasn’t even time for a leak. They were on the call, but that’s all right. So you assume that. You always assume that. But they’ll be going through pharmacies, hospitals, health care providers. Through our partnership with FedEx, UPS and McKesson, we’ll ship doses from warehouses directly to the designated sites. And we’re thrilled to be joined by representatives, those really great American companies. Those companies have worked with us and they’ve been incredible to work with. And I want to thank you all for being here, please. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. As I’ve stated all along and I guess as you saw pretty vividly, I heard about what they were going to show prior to my coming. You saw that very few people thought that this was possible. Of course there’ll be saying now we always told you it was so, but we have them saying a little bit different. But it has been incredible and it will end the pandemic. It will end the pandemic and we’re working with other nations. As you see actually by looking at your screen today, we’re working very closely with other nations also to get the vaccines out to other nations. And that’s very important. We work with the world. We’re working with the world. We have great companies and we’re working with the world. In just a few minutes, I’ll sign an executive order to ensure that the United States government prioritizes the getting out of the vaccine to American citizens before sending it to other nations. Now, if necessary, I told you we’ll invoke the Defense Production Act, but we don’t think it will be necessary. If it is, it’s a very powerful act as you know, because we’ve used it very, very successfully. While we begin to swiftly deploy the vaccine, we’ll continue to expand the availability of groundbreaking therapies. Since April advances in treatments have already helped reduce the mortality rate by 85%. Think of that, 85%. It’s an incredible number. I’ve delivered on my solemn promise to make the antibody treatments. They’re brilliant. They’re highly successful, available to every American, and we’re doing that free of cost, totally free of cost. So we’re making them available and they’re available now. And if somebody gets sick, it works where they go and they get treatment if that’s what the doctors are prescribing, and it’s been incredible, the success. And when you hear 85%, that’s some number. To me, that’s a number that goes along with anything else, including the vaccines when you think about it. As well as we’ve done with the vaccines, when you hear 85%, people find that one hard to believe. But you look at the stats and you see what’s happening. And you look at other countries, they’re having tremendous difficulties in Europe, tremendous, relatively beyond what we’re having. They’re having them all over the world. But this will vanquish the problem, this horrible scourge, as I call it the China virus because that’s where it came from. And the virus has really been looked at and studied all over the world. And our scientists, our industrial and economic mobilization has been like nobody else in the world could have done. And it’s very important that we share that with others and other nations. I’ve worked and invoked the Defense Production Act over 100 times to manufacture essential supplies in the United States. Despite the grim projections from the media eight months ago, where they said this was impossible, they actually said, and you saw that a little bit, but I could give you two hours worth of it, but they said it will never happen. You could never do it. It was a pipe dream. But we did something that nobody thought was possible. And we also did it where no American who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator. When this first came out, we weren’t equipped for that. Nobody was equipped for that. And we’re now making ventilators and we have all we need in this country. But we’re sending them to countries all over the world. We’re making thousands and thousands of ventilators a month. The United States has also created the largest, most advanced and most innovative testing program in the world by far. We’ve conducted over 200 million tests. Think of that, 200 million tests, more than all of the European Union combined. It’s not even close. Just 10 months ago, none of these innovations even existed. The tremendous progress that we’ve made is a testament to what our nation is capable of. When America is faced with a challenge, we come through and we always come through to overcome every hardship and surmount every obstacle. And I think you’ll be seeing that over the next few months. The numbers should skyrocket downward. We are the most exceptional nation in the history of the world. Today we’re on the verge of another American medical miracle. And that’s what people are saying. People that aren’t necessarily big fans of Donald Trump are saying whether you like him or not, this is one of the greatest miracles in the history of modern day medicine or any other medicine, any other age of medicine. American companies were the first to produce a verifiably safe and effective vaccine together. We will defeat the virus, and we will soon end the pandemic, and we will save millions and millions of lives both in our country and all over the world, and we’ve already started. Thank you again to every person here today and for the incredible achievements that you’ve done. You’re going to be very proud of this day and you’re going to be very proud of this period of time because nobody thought this was possible. Nobody thought it was even remotely possible to do what we’ve done in a period of less than nine months, something just not even thinkable. And we took a lot of heat when we said this is our goal and we frankly weren’t even quite using the numbers that we use. We far exceeded what we thought. If we would have said sometime next year, I think most people would have said that would be great. That would be a miracle. But we did it long before sometime next year. So now I want to ask several leaders who have been crucial in this effort to join me on stage as I signed the executive order to ensure that American citizens have first priority to receive American vaccines, and then we’re going to be working with other countries all over the world. And I think we’ll be able to start doing that almost immediately also because we have millions of doses coming in. So thank you very much. Thank you. It’s a great honor. Let’s see here. I guess we have to do our Vice President, right? Thank you very much. Spread that around. Spread the wealth. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Any questions please? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you all. Any questions, please? Question? Yes, please. Yeah. Well, CDC puts out their guidelines and they’re very important guidelines. But I think this. I think that the vaccine was our goal. That was number one because it was the way it ends. Plus you do have an immunity. You develop immunity over a period of time. And I hear we’re close to 15%. I’m hearing that. And that is terrific. That’s a very powerful vaccine in itself. And just tremendous progress has been made. One of the reasons we do show so many, and I say this, and I’ve been saying it for a long time, so many cases is because of the fact that we have 200 million tests, and you take, I think India is actually in second place with just a fraction of that number. So we’re many times greater than the second country, and India has 1.4 billion people where our testing program has been incredible. And we actually are also coming out with new tests very shortly that will make the process even easier. And you won’t need doctors necessarily to do the test. So we have some incredible tests coming out in a very short period of time. Yeah, please.

"118","12-22-20","Throughout the summer, Democrats cruelly blocked COVID relief legislation in an effort to advance their extreme left wing agenda and influence the election. Then a few months ago, Congress started negotiations on a new package to get urgently needed help to the American people. It’s taken forever. However, the bill they are now planning to send back to my desk is much different than anticipated. It really is a disgrace. For example, among the more than 5,000 pages in this bill, which nobody in Congress has read because of its length and complexity, it’s called the COVID Relief Bill, but it has almost nothing to do with COVID. This bill contains $85.5 million for assistance to Cambodia, $134 million to Burma, $1.3 billion for Egypt and the Egyptian military, which will go out and buy almost exclusively Russian military equipment. $25 million for democracy and gender programs in Pakistan, $505 million to Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama. $40 million for the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC, which is not even open for business. $1 billion for the Smithsonian and an additional $154 million for the National Gallery of Art. Likewise, these facilities are essentially not open. $7 million for reef fish management, $25 billion to combat Asian carp, $2.5 million to count the number of amberjack fish in the Gulf of Mexico. A provision to promote the breeding of fish in federal hatcheries, $3 million in poultry production technology, $2 million to research the impact of down trees, $566 million for construction projects at the FBI. The bill also allows stimulus checks for the family members of illegal aliens, allowing them to get up to $1,800 each. This is far more than the Americans are given. Despite all of this wasteful spending and much more, the $900 billion package provides hardworking taxpayers with only $600 each in relief payments and not enough money is given to small businesses. And in particular, restaurants, whose owners have suffered so grievously. They were only given a deduction for others to use in business, their restaurant, for two years. This two year period must be withdrawn, which will allow the owners to obtain financing and get their restaurants back in condition. Congress can terminate it at a much later date, but two years is not acceptable. It’s not enough. Congress found plenty of money for foreign countries, lobbyists and special interests while sending the bare minimum to the American people who need it. It wasn’t their fault, it was China’s fault. Not their fault. I am asking Congress to amend this bill and increase the ridiculously low $600 to $2,000 or $4,000 for a couple. I’m also asking Congress to immediately get rid of the wasteful and unnecessary items from this legislation and to send me a suitable bill or else the next administration will have to deliver a COVID relief package, and maybe that administration will be me, and we will get it done. Thank you very much.

"119","12-25-20","During the sacred season, Christians celebrate the greatest miracle in human history. More than 2,000 years ago, God sent his only begotten son to be with us. An angel announced the birth of our lord and savior to humble shepherds. He said, “I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all of the people. Today in the town of David, a savior has been born to you. He is the Messiah, the Lord. You will find a baby wrapped in clothes and lying in a manger.” At Christmas, we thank God for sending us his son to bring peace to our souls and joy to the world. We are delivering millions of doses of a safe and effective vaccine that will soon end this terrible pandemic and save millions and millions of lives. We’re grateful for all of the scientists, researchers, manufacturing workers, and service members who have worked tirelessly to make this breakthrough possible. It is truly a Christmas miracle. In this holy season, we thank God for his infinite love and we pray that the light of his glory will forever shine on this magnificent land. On behalf of Melania and the entire Trump family, we wish you a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year."
