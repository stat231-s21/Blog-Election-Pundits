Joe Biden: (00:00) Jill and I want to send you our warmest Easter greetings to you and your family. As we celebrate this most holy day, we know many are still going without familiar comforts of the season. The virus is not gone, and so many of us still feel the longing and loneliness of distance. For a second year, most will be apart from their families, their friends, the full congregations that fill us with joy. And yet, as the Gospel of John reminds us, the light shines in the darkness and the darkness has not overcome it. Jill Biden: (00:32) The traditions of Holy Week take us on a journey from sorrow to salvation, reminding us that with faith, hope, and love, anything is possible. And today, as spring returns, we see hope all around us. Families are getting the financial help they need to take a breath once again. Businesses are recovering and more and more Americans are getting life-saving vaccines. Joe Biden: (00:57) We share the sentiments of Pope Francis, who said that getting vaccinated is a moral obligation, one that can save your life and the lives of others. By getting vaccinated and encouraging your congregations and your communities to get vaccinated, we not only can beat this virus, we can also haste the day when we can celebrate the holidays together again. Jill Biden: (01:19) This Easter, from our family to yours, we wish you health, hope, joy, and the peace of God, which passes all understanding. Joe Biden: (01:30) Happy Easter, everyone. May the Lord bless you and keep you.
