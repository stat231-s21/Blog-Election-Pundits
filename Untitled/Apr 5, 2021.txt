President Joe Biden: (00:00) Good afternoon. Jill and I thank you for joining us today. And we have a special guest, as you can see to my left here. I’m thankful to our friends at the White House Historical Association and the National Park Service for helping us deliver thousands of commemorative eggs to vaccination sites, and communities, and healthcare centers all across America. Easter’s a day of joy when we celebrate resurrection and renewal. But this year, we know many are still going without the familiar comforts of the season. The virus is not gone, and the second year in a row most will be apart from their families, their friends in a full congregation that fill us with so much joy. But the scripture tells us, “Joy cometh in the morning.” President Joe Biden: (01:04) As we celebrate the renewal of this season, we know that long for dawn is almost here. We will rebuild our nation, we will reengage and reimagine what we can be. We’ll remember that with faith, hope, and love, anything is possible. And we’ll look forward to next year when the White House will ring with joy the season once again, and there’ll be an Easter Egg Roll, God willing. President Joe Biden: (01:40) And God bless you all, may God protect our troops and take care of the Easter Bunny. Thank you all very, very much. All right, stand in the middle, Easter Bunny. Right here, get in the middle. There you go, right here. First Lady Jill Biden: (01:55) Come here, Easter Bunny. President Joe Biden: (02:04) All right, nice to see you all. First Lady Jill Biden: (02:08) Here you go. Here Easter Bunny, here you go. President Joe Biden: (02:09) He can’t even see. First Lady Jill Biden: (02:10) There we go. President Joe Biden: (02:12) You got to squeeze. You got it, man. All right, thank you all.
