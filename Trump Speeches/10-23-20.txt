Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And hello, Florida. I love Florida. It’s great to be with you and back at The Villages. I like The Villages. Turn the mic up. It’s great to be with you. It’s something I’ve wanted to do. I was here four years ago in some little ballroom that held about 400 people. And I said, “I want to be with The Village, everybody.” I said, “Get a field or do something. Just go out and get a field. Go out and get a field.” And that’s what they did. You got a lot of people here. And I see you driving around in those beautiful golf carts, the most beautiful carts. I wanted to get one. I’m going to get a golf cart like that. But you have the best and you’re always fighting for me and I’m always fighting for you. And I appreciate it. That’s why we’re here. And we had an exciting night last night with Sleepy Joe. But I’m always here to protect you, and love, cherish, defend our nation, seniors. And not all of you are seniors. I see a lot of people that are very young here. [inaudible 00:01:40]. And I see a lot of people that are young at heart, right? We’re young at heart, all of us, and the timeless values that make this nation the greatest nation anywhere in the world. Eleven days from now, we’re going to win the state of Florida. We’re going to win four more years in the White House. I think Joe Biden proved last night that he’s not capable of being President of the United States. Come on, Gabe. The country saw firsthand that this election is a choice between a Trump recovery, and I’ll call it because that’s what’s happening, it’s a Trump super recovery and a Biden depression because you will have a depression. Who has 401(k)s in this group? Anybody? If he got in, wave bye-bye to your 401(k) because it’s going down the tubes. It’s a choice between optimism, patriotic vision for American success, or Joe Biden’s dark, dismal, gloomy. Did you hear what he said last night about darkness, darkness, always darkness? But it’s a gloomy vision. We’re about the American dream, all about the American dream, greatest country in the world. Joe Biden is totally controlled by the radical socialist left. This country will never be a socialist country. Never. One of the most stunning moments last night was when Joe Biden admitted that he wants to abolish the oil industry. That wasn’t too good. Did you see him this morning? This morning, “I didn’t really need that. I didn’t mean that.” It was the last question they talked about that. I said, “Whoa, this is the big point of the evening.” Remember, I said, “Well, you want to get rid of oil and gas?” Is that … “Yeah, well, we want to phase it out.” I said, “Thank you. Texas are you watching? Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, Ohio are you watching now?” Now they’re going around, Kamala. Kamala is going around saying, “No, no, no. We want to keep it.” This woman is a super radical left. She’s against fracking. If they get in, they’ll end your energy independence. We have energy independence right now. They will end it very quickly. Now they’re going around trying to make … That was one of the, well, we’re going to have to see how it works out, but that could be one of the worst mistakes made in presidential debate history. We’re going to see. We hope it is. This is perhaps the most shocking admission ever made during a debate, where he goes in and he says no fracking. But he’s been saying it, no fracking. He got the nomination, all of the sudden, he’s fracking. No fossil fuels and no gas-powered cars. Ultimately, let’s not have cars. Let’s get rid of airplanes. How about that Senator from Hawaii, where she went along with the Green New Deal? When she said, “Yes, I’m in favor.” I said, “Yeah, but you’re not allowed to use airplanes under the Green New Deal.” And she’s in Hawaii. She said, “Well, I don’t know what to tell you.” And she says, “Maybe we can build a bridge to Hawaii instead.” She’s a beauty, isn’t she? She’s great. Biden’s plan would mean American seniors have no air conditioning during the summer, no heat during the winter, and no electricity during peak hours. It’s true. He wants wind. He wants to wind. When the wind doesn’t blow, “Let’s watch the president tonight, Darling, on television.” “I’m sorry, we can’t do it. The wind’s not blowing tonight.” Last night, Biden pledged to institute the most horrible and dangerous immigration policy ever in this country, catch and release. He wants to bring it back. It took me two years to get rid of it. That’s where you catch a criminal, it could be a rapist, could be a murder, a real criminal, and you just released criminal and say, “Please come back in four years.” Did you see what he said last night? He said, “Oh, and then they come back for court.” I said, “No, they don’t come back, Joe, 1%.” He said, “They come back.” No. I said, “Joe, you don’t know anything about it. They don’t come back.” This a very bad policy, Joe. They don’t come back. They need Perry Mason, but they don’t Perry Mason. They just don’t come back. Criminals and rapists and even murders are set free and they’re set free into our country. It’s ended now. It was very hard to get ended. What I had to do to end it, I will not tell you. I will not tell the people of The Villages. I won’t tell the people of The Villages. And by the way, you love it here, right? I don’t know. It’s an incredible, popular place. I see it so much. It’s incredible, the love, the spirit. So do you love the people that developed it? I think so, right? Right. It’s nice to have somebody but that wasn’t the same love as you had for the … No, no. Somebody did a good job. Thank you. Thank you. Look at this guy. Look. Beautiful. Look, it’s Uncle Sam. Come here, Uncle Sam. Look at this guy. Look. This is a hell of a day. Mr. Congressman, how are you? When are you getting married? Are you getting married soon? [inaudible 00:07:33] Don’t lose her, Congressman. You’ll be very depressed. Biden says America is nothing more than an idea, right? He also said, didn’t he say Antifa is just an idea too? So he’s saying … Only at The Villages could you say it. He said America was an idea. But come to think of it, he said Antifa’s an idea too, right? Well, America is not an idea. It’s a great country. I’ll tell you, it’s a great country. And America is our home. It’s a nation and it’s a nation that has borders. When you have borders, you have a nation. You take away the borders … They want to take away the borders. They want to take down the wall. The wall is now 400-plus miles long. How about that? And it goes very high and very low. It goes down deep for two reasons. To hold it up is one. That’s a good reason, but also for the tunnels. And Arizona’s very happy. We just got back, Pam, some numbers from Arizona. Very good. Numbers from Florida, I don’t want to talk to you, but look at all the fake news back there. I don’t want to talk about it. I don’t want to talk about it. Look at all those people. There’s the great John Roberts, who’s generally speaking, very good. John, generally. But he has bad moments. Hello, John. You having a good time? He’s a good guy. John is good. John is good. They’re not all fake, just about 85% of them. But isn’t it amazing? Some day, I’d like to make a speech without any press. Without any press. One little mistake and they try and take you out. And I do this four times a day. It’s crazy. So we’re going on a tour for the next 10 days. Can you believe it? We’re down to 10, 11 days. And we’ll be doing two or three of these and then four these, and then we’re going to end up five or six of these a day. Do you believe it? Is this any kind of a life? Is this a life? Who can do that? Who can do that? Do you think Sleepy Joe can do that? I don’t think so. I don’t think so. I don’t think he can do it. I knew there was a reason I wanted to be at The Villages. This is a hard thing. This was very hard. They said, “They have no field that’s large enough.” I said, “Do have a polo field someplace? Let’s get a polo field.” Looking at that equipment. Look at those helicopters. How good are they? Everything is good. 2.5 trillion, we should have good helicopters. But if Biden wins, your borders will be gone and your country will be gone, frankly., Look, this is not a man that’s capable. When I meet with these heads of state, the one thing I can tell you, they’re sharp. They’re sharp. They’re not off. They’re sharp. This is not a man that can handle the job. He leaves his house this morning, he gets up, and I’m going to talk about it. All he talks about is COVID, COVID, COVID because they want to scare people. And we’ve done so well with it. Now it’s 99.8%. I mean, you look at what’s going on and we’re rounding the turn. We’re rounding the corner. We’re rounding the corner beautifully. But Joe Biden was very disrespectful last night to President Barack Hussein Obama. You saw that. Barack Hussein Obama. Remember Rush Limbaugh would always do that. He’d do, “Barack Hussein Obama.” And Rush is doing okay. Rush is great, isn’t he? Do we love Rush? He’s got such guts and he’s going through a lot, but he’s got courage like you people have. He always has had courage. At last night’s debate, though, he was very disrespectful, really disrespectful. When he said that he, Joe, was vice president, not president, blaming Obama when trying to make excuses for the failed immigration policies, right? You saw that? “I wasn’t the president. It was him.” Because we talked about cages, right? I said, ” Joe, you built the cages.” Remember, they tried to say “cages for children.” And they said, “Trump built cages.” And then they found out it was a little problem. There was a picture in the New York Times, the failing New York Times. If you take a look at what its unfunded liability is, check it out sometime. It’s definitely failing. It’s only a question of when. But you take a look at the failing New York Times and they had a picture of a cage and they thought that I built it. And it said “cage.” And then somebody called me, they said, “Sir, that was built,” one of the people that helped build it, “that was built in 2014.” I said, “2014, I didn’t happen to be president.” It was built under Obama/Sleepy Joe Biden. And so did you notice when I kept saying, “Why did you build the cages, Joe? Why did you?” And he just kept talking. He didn’t want any part of it. But they started it. If you want jobs, safety, and borders, you have to vote for the party of Abraham Lincoln, Honest Abe. Vote Republican. And I’m voting early tomorrow in Florida. Do you believe that? I’m coming to vote. I came down here to vote. I actually came down here to see The Villages, and tomorrow morning I’m voting here as opposed to sending it in, you know, just mail it. I liked being able to vote. I’m old fashioned I guess. I like to get online and I have to stand there for two hours, maybe they’ll move you up a little bit. But I liked the vote. So I’m coming, I’m going to be voting here tomorrow. And I urge every one of you to go and vote. And I don’t think I have to urge too many. How many people here have already voted? That’s incredible. Thank you. Look at you. How many people here have voted for President Trump? How many people here have voted for Sleepy Joe Biden, please? I don’t see any hands. I tend to believe them. Sleepy Joe, no, he’s not the guy. For 47 years, Joe Biden sent American jobs to China and other nations while the Bidens vacuum up. Look, did you see what’s going on with his son? I mean, he goes into a country, the guy leaves with volumes of money, vacuum up millions of dollars all over the globe. Last night, Joe lied straight to the American people. He claimed that he had never taken a penny from any foreign source, ever in my life, ever. I mean, he goes to think of it, his son, without a job knows nothing about energy. These young people in the front, do you know anything about energy? No. She said, no. She knows more than Hunter. Remember, where is Hunter? By the way, where the hell is Hunter? Where’s Hunter? Remember the t-shirt? I said one time, “Where’s Hunter,” the next day they had a t-shirt, “Where’s Hunter?” There he is. Hunter, you gained weight. But you look even better. You still look better. Anyway. No, but think of it, he gets lined up with this Ukrainian energy company, not the highest reputation. $ 183,000 a month to be on the board, right? Gets a $3 million upfront payment. Then that’s only the first nation that he goes. He has no knowledge of energy whatsoever. Anybody in this audience knows more. They then go to China. Let’s go to China. He gets 1.5 billion to manage, meaning millions of dollars a year in fees. He then goes to Russia, he got three and a half million from the mayor of Moscow’s wife, three and a half million dollars. And Obama was in charge of all of that stuff. Then they stole the premier, they stold the submarine port, Russia. And Russia takes it. And he’s in charge of Russia, but he got three and a half million dollars. So what’s going on with that? So he was in charge of Ukraine, China, Russia. That was sort of a responsibility of the vice president. And he got money from all of them. And he got it from his son and the son made no money for years. And all of a sudden he’s making all this money. They’re corrupt politicians. Okay. You say what you want. And then you see the notes, and you see the gentleman that got up yesterday and you see what he had to say. He’s a legitimate person. But you see the notes that you see that Joe gets 10% of everything, right? And Pammy got 50% of something. And then the guy has the deal in China where he wants to get $10 million a year, 10 million a year for introductory purposes. In other words, he’s going to introduce people. You know who he’s going to introduce, his father, that’s who he’s going to introduce. It’s a bad deal. It’s a bad deal. It’s corrupt as hell. I don’t care what you say. It’s corrupt as hell. Okay. And they like to also, when they say, “Oh, well, what about you and your kids?” I don’t do deals. I don’t do deals. I used to do more deals. I was the king of deals. But I don’t do deals. Like you tell my kids, you can’t, it’s a conflict, just don’t do it. So, it’s possibly allowed. It probably is allowed. But I say, “We don’t need it. Just don’t do them.” My kids, these kids have done such a good job. They have done such a good job. And they don’t do deals. The Bidens got rich while America got robbed. And how did Biden get so wealthy spending a half a century in public office? He’s been in public office for 47 years, almost 50 years. He used his office for personal profit at your expense, and my expense, and all of our expenses. In 2016, Florida voted to fire this [inaudible 00:18:08] political establishment. And you elected an outsider as president who is finally putting America first and putting The Villages first, putting The Villages. We’re putting The Villages first. And if I don’t sound like a typical Washington politician it’s because I’m not a politician. And if I don’t always play by the rules of the Washington establishment, the deep state, the RINOs. The RINOs are almost worse than our enemy. The RINOs, we love those RINOs. Republican in name only. You know what that is, right? Republican in name only. We got a lot of them. But it is slowly disappearing. It’s amazing. They disappear into the woods. But if I don’t always play by the rules of the Washington establishment, it’s because I was elected to fight for you and I fought for you harder than any president has ever fought for anybody. And with your vote, we’ll continue to cut taxes. I got you the largest tax cut in the history of our country. Cut regulations, lower drug prices. Your drugs will be going down 60, 70, 80% because I’m instituting what’s called the favored nations clause. You see all the commercials the drug companies are running against me? It’s unbelievable. It’s unbelievable. This is why I see politicians. This is one of the many reasons why. The other reason is that the biggest lobbyist, the biggest donator by far are the drug companies. Very powerful, a lot of money. They are taking commercials at me. I don’t care. I’m doing the right thing. I instituted a favored nations clause where the United States, right now we pay the highest price of any country in the world by far, it’s not even close. It’s not even close. You can have a pill that sells for 25 cents identical and in the United States could sell for $3. That’s how bad it is. It’s terrible. So I instituted what we call a favored nations clause. So we will now go, we will be paying the lowest price, match the lowest price anywhere in the world. And I’m getting hit hard on that one, but that’s okay, Pam. Is that okay? I’ll have to withstand, the commercials are unbelievable. They’re unbelievable, but that’s okay. People get it. We want to support our police, protect our second amendment. They want to take your second amendment away. Defend our borders, maintain energy independence, and ensure more products are proudly stamped with the phrase, that gorgeous phrase, made in the USA. We’ll deliver record prosperity, epic growth, and a safe vaccine is quickly coming that will help end, by the way it’s ending anyway, it’s going to end. You’re going to have surges. Look at Europe. They have a surge. Then it goes down. Look at Florida. You have a great governor by the way. You have a great governor. And you have an even better first lady, but I won’t say that. Now you have a great governor. In fact, the governor is going to go to Canada. I gave him the right. He’s going to Canada, where they pay 50% less for the same drug. And he’s going to buy for the state of Florida, until this favored nations kicks in, where you go down 70, 80, 90%. And last year was the first year in 53 years, that drug prices in this country went down. Not by much, but they went down. They didn’t go up. 1%, not much, not proud, 1%, but with favored nations, you’ll go down 50, 60, 70, maybe even 80% in drug prices. But I gave your governor the right to go to Canada and buy drugs in Canada. The same exact drug from the same factory, same company, 50% and even more discount. And so you’re going to start seeing it fast. And then ultimately the favored nations will kick in. So I better be president when all this stuff happens. Can you imagine it’s all done? Can you imagine if sleepy Joe said, “I’ve done a very good job on drug pricing.” “What did you do, Joe?” “I don’t know. I don’t know what I did.” Thank you very much. We’re going to quickly end this pandemic, this horrible plague that came in from China. They should have stopped it and we’re not going to forget what they did. We’re not forgetting at all. I’d signed a great trade deal with China. Recently they had the biggest order of corn in the history of our country. Biggest order of soybeans, biggest order of beef, but you know what? It’s no longer the same to me. Doesn’t mean the same. Would have been great. I would have been so proud of it, but now I don’t view it the same. Normal life. That’s all we want. Normal life will fully resume. We had the greatest economy in our history. And next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country, we’re doing it. We’ve got this. We have a super V going up. If you look at housing, if you look at cars, if you look at car production, nobody can believe the numbers and you’re going to have a number released very soon. And the number is going to be… Think of it. Think of this. You’re going to have a GDP. Now the Fed, Atlanta, I believe the Atlanta Fed projected GDP of 35% in the third quarter. I don’t know if it’s going to be 35. In any event that would be higher than any GDP ever in history. And many times higher than our highest, which I think was like seven or 8%. 35%, we’ll see. We’ll see. Whether it was 20%, it was 12%, I’d say it was great. But they just came out, they said 35. Who knows if they’re right. We’re going to see. Here’s the goodness news, it’s going to be announced right before November 3rd, right before. And I’m willing to take my chances, being a gambling man, I’m willing to take my chances. I think it’s going to be a magnificent, whether it’s 25, 35, 20, no matter what it is, it’s going to be a great number because we’re doing numbers like nobody would believe. We thought we’d have an unemployment of 40, 42%. You know what it was? It dropped down to 7.8%. And yesterday, Larry Kudlow called, the great Larry Kudlow. And he said, by a certain it’s 5.8%. Think of that. And we’re in the midst of rounding out, but in the midst of a pandemic. It’s actually amazing what everybody has done. And I’ve been given a lot of help with some of the people over here. I gave you the largest tax cut and reforms in American history, and we will cut taxes further. And we’re cutting taxes for the middle class. We’re cutting taxes for people that need jobs and nobody’s ever done it at a level like we’ve done it. By contrast sleepy Joe Biden will give you the single biggest tax hike in the history of our country. He’s talking about quadrupling taxes, 4 trillion in taxes so he can waste it on the green new deal. The green new deal, no cars, no airplanes, no cows. No cows, you know. Whatever happened? Did they ever leave the cows in? I think they had to take that out, right [inaudible 00:06:53]. Originally, it was no cows. They didn’t want to have any cattle or cows, which is pretty brutal when you think of it, right? He’ll bury you in regulations, dismantle your police departments, dissolve our borders, confiscate your guns, terminate religious liberty, destroy your suburbs. I’m always saying, I’ll tell you this, the fraudulent media. So I always get up and I have fun. Please, please, suburban women. You should love me. I ended the regulation that’s going to destroy the suburbs. Please, please, suburban women. You should love me. Because somebody said, I’m not doing that well with suburban women. I said, “Why?” Last time I was supposed to be doing terribly with women, then I got 52%. They said, what the hell happened with Trump and women all of a sudden? Remember they said Trump did well with women. So how’d it go? Hey, so I get it, I get it. I say, “Please, please, suburban women, please, please love me, suburban women. I want you to love me because I got rid of the regulation that’s going to destroy your neighborhood. You don’t want to have projects next year house. You don’t want to have crime in the suburbs, et cetera, right? So I go on 60 minutes and she says, Lesley Stahl, that’s another beauty. She goes, “You were begging, you were begging suburban women to love you, weren’t you?” I said, “No, no, I was just having fun. We were just having fun.” These people are sick. They are bad. They are bad. But they want to decimate Florida seniors and seniors, all seniors, okay? And by the way, what I’ve done for suburban women, but suburban people, people that live in the suburbs, that’s really the dream. That’s the American dream. And you know, 30% of the people, because people say, “Oh, is that racist?” 30% of the people living in the suburbs are minority groups, Hispanic American, black American. Think of it, Asian American. 30, 31% are from minority groups. For years Joe Biden fought to cut your social security. He wanted to cut it. He wanted to knock it out and Medicare, which Joe has now falsely denied. You notice? Oh, I loved it yesterday. The way he denied that. So does that mean you want to get rid of fossil fuel Joe? Oh yes. That’s what it means. Thank you. This debate let’s end it. Let’s end it right now. By the way I got treated, I thought, very fairly by the anchor. I thought, right, Kristen, I was surprised. She’s been a little bit rough on me over the years. I was surprised, but her network has been crazy, NBC con test, C-O-N con test. I thought Kristen did a very good job yesterday. Some people said she interrupted me much more than she interrupted sleep Joe. But that’s because he didn’t have that much to say, so. But no, I thought she was fair. I said it to her in the show, I said, “I think you’ve handled it very professionally.” It’s not easy. So today I want to show you Joe Biden’s own words. The video I’m about to play was created by Bernie Sanders, crazy Bernie. You know, Bernie is the single greatest loser. The way he loses, he gets sportsmanship of the year, right? What they did to him four years ago was quite terrible. What they did to him was even… Then he just goes back to Congress and talks. He’s crazy Bernie. A lot of his people are going to come with us because you know why? They love our trade policy. Because he, like me, understands how badly we’ve been taken advantage of by other countries, including our allies by the way. The video I’m about to play was created by crazy Bernie earlier this year to expose Joe Biden’s atrocious record and his egregious lies. Go ahead, play it Mr Deville. I’ll tell you what, do these people do a good job? Do they do a good job? No, he’s a liar. He lies about everything. He’s now lying about not being a corrupt politician. I called him last night. I don’t want to say that, but he’s a corrupt politician and he’ll lie. But he lied about that. He lied about fracking and he’ll look at you and he’ll lie. He goes, “There will be no fracking. There will be no fracking.” This goes on for a year. Then he goes to Pennsylvania. He says. “There’ll be fracking.” And then you’ll say, “Well, wait, you said there will be none.” He’ll say, “No. I never said that.” This guy is either really stupid or he lies, at a level that nobody’s ever seen before. By the way, that’s a great video. Who did that video? I love that video. Who the hell did it? I have some good, talented people. Under my leadership, no one will touch your Medicare and nobody will touch your social security, okay? By the way, that’s a devastating video. I just saw it for the first time. That’s devastating. Now Biden’s pushing free government healthcare, which is socialized medicine and mass amnesty for illegal aliens, meaning he wants to take care of illegal aliens before he takes care of our seniors. And you know, the problem is we all want to take care of everybody. But if you ever do that, where you give Medicare, you give free everything, including education, you’re going to have this country swamped with millions and millions of people from all over the world, wanting to pour in to get. You can’t do it. And it would obliterate your Medicare and your social security, totally obliterate it. Joe Biden cares more about illegal aliens that he does about senior citizens. And that’s true. And you see it in that clip. I believe that American seniors must come first, okay? Must come first. That’s true. Must come first. Last night, Biden outlined a plan, to create socialized medicine, raiding Medicare, to fund his government takeover. Biden’s running mate, the most liberal member of the United States Senate… By the way, Kamala will not be your first female president. She will not be your first female president. That’s not the way it’s supposed to be. We’re not supposed to have the socialist… Look, we’re not going to be a socialist nation. We’re not going to have a socialist president, especially a female socialist president. We’re not going to have it. We’re not going to put up with it. It’s not going to happen. Most liberal member, more so than Bernie of the US Senate, co-sponsors a socialist healthcare plan to end Medicare, as you know it, and Medicare works, Medicare works. We love our Medicare. It does work. And eliminate Medicare advantage, which nearly 2 million Florida seniors depend on, including one out of every two Hispanic seniors. You see how well I’m doing with Hispanic? Do you see? They’re going crazy. No, they’re going crazy. They don’t know what happened. They go like our Democrat rivals that have it a lot of times. African American doing well, Hispanic, Hispanic is like, they don’t know what’s going on. Not the Hispanics I’m talking the Democrats are saying, “What the hell is going on here?” You’re going to have a big surprise. You know that beautiful, beautiful… You heard about the red wave, right? It’s called the great wave. We’re all waiting for that great red wave. But we’re supposed to be… All these votes are going to come in and then we catch them up later on because our people like to go to vote, like me, but we catch up later on. There’s only one problem, in a lot of cases we’re already winning. This is before the wave. We’re already winning. So a lot of interesting things are happening and those guys back there are saying… Well, some of them like it I think, but you know, the interesting thing, without me, you know, what’s going to happen to their ratings? Bom, bom. Can you imagine if you had four years of covering sleepy Joe? It wouldn’t be four years. Since I took office, we’ve reduced Medicare advantage premiums by 34%. Good management. Socialist healthcare programs, like the one supported by Biden and Harris always end up denying coverage to the sick and the elderly in order to reduce the soaring cost. Our opponents want to turn America into a communist Cuba, into a socialist Venezuela. If you look at the ideology that these people are talking about, take a look at Portland with the anarchists all over the place. By the way, we’re asking the governor for approval to go in and clean out that mess, which has been going on for 140 days. But it’s really been going on for many years. It’s been going on like at Portland, anarchists, and it’d be so easy. Look at what we did in Minneapolis. After 10 days of rioting and everything else, we sent in the National Guard. They lined up. They lined up again, again, again. World’s most expensive outfits, 250,000 a piece. Helmets and the like are solid computer, right? And they had their tear gas, they had their pepper spray, which the Democrats don’t want you to use. They don’t want you to use anything. They want you to get hit. They want you to get hit with rocks and stones. But they had their tear gas and they just marched forward. And in one and a half hour, the whole thing was over. It was all over. The only problem is they should have called us in sooner. If Biden wins, the radical left will transform this country into something that you will not recognize. They want to shatter the middle-class with trillions of dollars of new taxes, four trillion dollars, pack the Supreme court with far left judges, 16, 18, 20. And how do you like Amy Coney Barrett? Everybody. She’s great. She’s great. She made them look a little foolish, didn’t she? As the Democrats went after her, it was like, bomp. “What do you have written down? What do you have written down on your pad?” ” Nothing.” That’s cool. Happened to be a Republican that asked the question. Figure that one out, right? They want to unleash the violent rioters, criminal aliens, MS-13 killers, and they will indoctrinate your grandchildren and your children with poisonous anti-American lies in their schools, which I ended, which we’ve ended. If you want your grandchildren to grow up in a free nation where they can speak their minds and pursue the American dream then you must defeat Sleepy Joe Biden and the radical left. Have to do it. And it’s not really Joe. Look, let’s face it. Joe doesn’t have a clue, but he’s surrounded by people that definitely they’ve got some problems. You’ve got to recheck the left wing fascism and vote for American freedom. Our country is set to be greater than ever before. Watch, watch. We’re set. We’re joined today by some incredible people, and the man I just mentioned, he’s just a friend of mine. He said, “I’d love to run for Governor.” And he did run and I endorsed him and he ran and he went like a rocket ship. He was a great candidate. He had to run a candidate against a very, very powerful, very powerful, great Democrat with a tremendous future. They said, “He’s going to be the future of the Democrat Party.” How’s he doing, by the way? Is he doing fine? I think Ron did him a favor by beating him. He did the Democrats a favor by beating him, right? But Ron DeSantis became your Governor. You have an incredible first lady in Casey DeSantis, decides, and they’re here. Hey, Ron, how are we doing? If we don’t win, I’ll never speak to him again. A warrior, a great guy that has always been there for me. He’s tough. He’s strong. He’s smart. Congressman Mike Waltz. Congressman. And a man with maybe the greatest name in politics, who also, whenever you need him, he’s there and he loves your state and he loves our country. Daniel Webster. How’s that name? How is that name? Hello, Daniel. What a name. With a name like that, how can you lose it in politics? Daniel Webster. Congressional candidate, who’s way ahead in the polls, Kat Cammack. She’s way ahead. How’s that number looking, Kat? It’s huge. She’s known great. She’s a future star. And a future current and past star and a really great friend of mine, somebody that has always been there, former Florida Attorney General, she could have anything she wanted, by the way, anything, former Attorney General, Pam Bondi. Great woman, great person. She could have anything she wants. When you’re going back into running or something, or anytime you don’t want to come into the administration, just call. But I hear she’s doing very well, to put it mildly, right? All Biden and his handlers in the media want to talk about today is COVID, COVID, COVID. You know that. You just turn on CNN, look, their light just went off, you turn on CNN, you turn on MSDNC, you turn on these networks, there’s COVID, COVID, COVID. On November 4th, you won’t hear anything about it because we are rounding that turn. You won’t hear. But they wanted to scare you to try to make you vote for Biden. That’s all he can talk about because his record is horrible. And by the way, his record with the H1N1, which he always refers to as swine flu, was horrendous. The person that ran it, his chief of staff, right, Steve, ran it, the person, the chief of staff said it was a catastrophe. “We didn’t know what we were doing.” It was an absolute disaster. Now he’s going to come in and tell us what to do. Do you ever see where he said, “You were late,” except when I closed it to China, he said I shouldn’t close it. For two and a half months he said I shouldn’t lose it then he ultimately admitted that he was wrong. And then he amazingly got a nomination, which he should have never gotten because you know why? Pocahontas, if she would have gotten out three days early, it’s true. She took all of Bernie’s on Super Tuesday. It’s true. Do you agree with that, Congressman? She took all of his votes away. All he needed was a few more of us. He would have won every state. So you have somebody that really got a little bit lucky. In prime time, they used to call him 1% Joe. Now, in far less than prime time, he gets the nomination. Figured this one. Only in the world of politics can this happen. But if you watch CNN and MSDNC, the networks, that’s all they talk about. They focus on case numbers, case numbers. You know why we have so many case numbers? Because we do more testing than any country in the world times five, 10, 20. You have many countries don’t do any testing so they don’t have any cases. You have many, many countries that have very few cases because they don’t do testing. We test. We have tests like you wouldn’t believe. We got started because the fake news would say, “Where’s the testing?” We did more. We have the best tests in the world, and there’s plenty good about testing too. The bad thing is you find cases. Baron Trump, young man, 14, strong. So he tests positive. I said, “Oh, that’s terrible.” They said, “No, it’s okay.” The doctor, great doctor, White House doctor, Sean. I said, 15 seconds later, “How’s Baron doing?” “He’s all better, sir.” I said, “What are you talking about?” The fact that is young people, 99.99 or something young people, their immune systems, I hate to say it, they’re a little stronger than our immune systems, right? Well, I got it and here we are. Here we are. It works out good. Here we are. And the good news, once you get it, you’re immune. Now, it used to be before I got it you were immune for life. I heard you were immune for life. Once I got it, they said, “No, it’s only four months.” Okay. We have a double standard. You ever notice that? It was always once you get it, you’re immune. I get it, “Nope. It’s only good for four months.” It’s the fake news. Last night, Biden in his very weak debate performance, did you see some of the debates, 91% to 9%, 91% in my favor, 91 to 9, I like that, I like the sound of that, but last night he said, “America is entering a dark winter.” Isn’t that really inspirational? He’s running for President. Think of it. We have this guy that can’t even speak and he goes, “We’re entering a dark winter.” So inspirational, but he’s trying to scare people, basically. He’s trying to get something because he’s been such a failure at every level of government that this is something. But what they don’t remember is the swine flu and how bad it was. I bring that up whenever I can. But we’re not entering a dark winter. We’re entering the final turn and approaching the light at the end of the tunnel. That’s the way I look at it. I took very rapid action to ban travel from China and Europe. And Biden opposed it. We pioneered incredible therapies and we reduced the fatality rate by 85%. Think of that, what we’ve learned, what we’ve learned. And we went out and we made just incredible things. The equipment we made, the equipment that we bought, the ventilators. We’re the king of ventilators now as a country. Everybody has ventilators. We’re sending them all over the world. We’re making them by the thousands. We’re the only one who could do anything like that. It’s the biggest mobilization of anything since World War Two, the ventilator, the big thing. And I’m working to make the antibody treatment that I received available free to anybody that needs it, and they will have it done pretty soon. All I know I can talk to this group, because we have something to get comment. All I know is I didn’t feel too good, and it’s been a long time since I didn’t feel so good. I didn’t have time to feel bad, right? But I didn’t feel so good. I said, “Doc, I’m not feeling too great here. And he said, “Let me check it out. Oh, you’re positive.” That’s not what I wanted to hear. But I can’t put myself into a basement of the White House. I don’t have that luxury. No, no, I’m the President of the United States. I can’t put myself into a beautiful bedroom and not come out for a year and a half someplace at the White House. I’ve got to work. I meet with military leaders. I meet with foreign leaders. I meet with Gold Star families. I meet with so many people. I can’t close myself up. And I say, “Oftentimes, I just met a lot of people. That’s risky.” And then one day I got it. I mean, I got it. And the First Lady got it. But we got it. You see a lot of people, but we have a job to do. And we beat it and we beat it and we beat it. It was good. But I will tell you, I wasn’t feeling great and I’m laying in bed, and one thing when you’re President, you’re going to find this out, Mr. Congressman, one thing, when you’re President, you’re not feeling good, you’re laying in a bed, you’ve got more doctors than any human being has ever had. I had 12 doctors, I had doctors from the greatest schools in the world. John’s Hopkins was there and Walter Reed Medical Center. These people are unbelievable, the job they do. The job they do for our incredible soldiers, our wounded warriors, our people that come home that are badly injured, badly hurt, the job they do is incredible. So I’m laying there not feeling my best, and every doctor had a different specialty, and I had more hands on me than any human being, and I didn’t like it. I said, “Come on, let’s make this quick.” But the bottom line is I took this Regeneron, it’s called, and I wake up the next morning and I felt like Superman. It’s like, “Get me out of here. I’ve got to get back to the people.” I don’t know. Maybe it works. Maybe it doesn’t. Maybe it was me. No, there he is. Superman. Look at that. Super Trump. Wow. Look at this guy. Do you live at the villages? I don’t think so. Do you? You don’t. Do you really? This guy lives at the villages. I think I’ll move in. I have an idea. I will sell Mar-A-Lago, and I’ll move to the villages. You know what? It’s not the worst idea. I like that idea. I like that idea. I like the people here. We’ll have 100 million vaccine doses before the end of this year and seniors will be the first in line. We’re taking care of our seniors. Under my plan, you will get incredible lifesaving therapies. Our therapies are incredible. Remdesivir just got approved. You saw that. Just today got approved. And the FDA has moved at a pace that they’ve never moved before. They’re approving things in weeks which used to take years. That’s a little prodding for me, I have to be honest with you. But they’re doing it. They’re doing it. They’re doing a great job. You will get a vaccine that ends the epidemic or the pandemic and it ends it and eradicates it. But without it, it goes away. But with it, it goes away faster, and it’s going to happen very, very soon. You’re going to have it very soon. A lot of great companies are right there. You’ll get to see your friends, families, and loved ones and you’ll get to enjoy being with them in their golden years. It’s a sad thing where you can’t be near people. I mean, did you ever hear of anything like this? You can’t be near people when they’re in trouble. But where we’re going to be very close. We’re very, very close. You watch. Under Biden’s land, you’ll be locked down for years. The cure will be worse than the problem itself. Remember that. You’ve got to lead your life. And you know what? Some people want to say it and that’s good. Do it, do it. I’m like, lead your life, right? And some people agree with me. But if you want to stay in, if you want to do what you’re doing, you do it. If you want to get out and you want to be careful and socially distance and all of the things, you could wear a mask if you can’t socially distance, but there are a lot of things you can do. But some people want to stay in. And that’s okay. There’s nothing wrong with it. But you’re going to have a vaccine and it’s going to be an incredible success. Wait until you see these vaccines that they’re coming out with, and you’re going to have therapeutics and therapies and cures. To me, the cure or the therapy is more important than the vaccine. Not everybody agrees. I think you go in, and even the fact that it’s there, Regeneron, it had a hell of an effect on me. And somebody said I looked better last night than I used to. And I said, “I think it was Regeneron.” But to me, I don’t know, maybe not everybody agrees, but to me knowing that there’s something that can knock it out, to me, is actually more important than a vaccine. But the vaccines are coming. Therapeutics are already here and coming, and, in my opinion, the therapeutics in some cases are already cures. Under my administration, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world, and now we’re doing it again. So it’s called Make America Great Again, Again. Right? Make America Great Again, Again. So we’re going to change all the hats. You’re going to have to go out to buy a new one. It’s going to have again, again, exclamation point. In my first three years, we increased family income over $6,000, more than five times the gains in all eight years under the last administration. Think of what that means. African American unemployment, Hispanic American unemployment, and Asian American unemployment all reached their lowest levels ever recorded. we lifted nearly seven million Americans out of poverty, including more than 1.5 million Hispanic Americans. And when the virus hit, we experienced the smallest contraction, think of that, the smallest of any major country and the fastest recovery of any country in the world. We’re recovering at a level that nobody’s seen. And that’s despite the fact the Democrat Governors have a lot of their states closed. When you look at Michigan, although we just won the court case against her, the only one that was given freedom was her husband, he was the only one that was allowed to go sailing on the lake. Nobody else could do it. But we just won the case. It was unconstitutional what she was doing. She was running it like a prison camp. And you have Pennsylvania, you have North Carolina, and you have other places, they’ve got to open them up. I guarantee, November 4th they’ll say, “Well, we’ve decided to open.” They just want to keep the numbers down as much as possible. It’s not going to help them. Since April, we’ve created a record 11.4 million jobs. Under Biden, it 30 months to recover more than half of the jobs lost to the crisis. We did it in five months. Think of that. 30 months, my, my. And they had the slowest recovery in history or in 1929, since 1929. They don’t know which, they say it both ways. But 1929’s a long time ago. It was the slowest recovery since 1929. We’ve achieved energy independence, and we’ve done it while protecting our pristine environment. I recently signed an order placing a moratorium on offshore drilling off the coast of Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and I decided to add Florida. Is that okay? We added Florida. We didn’t want to make you too unhappy. No, we added Florida right at the beginning. Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure border in U.S. history and we’re finishing the wall 400 miles and Mexico is paying for the wall. You do know that, okay? They like to say, “After years of fighting for it,” I made a terrible mistake, I should have said, “We will not build the wall. We will never ever build a wall. We will never build the wall,” and the Democrats would have insisted that I build it. We should have done that. If we did that, we’d have no problem. It took me two years to get this thing done. But when you’re a developer from New York or a developer anywhere, getting financing is always not so hard. The Biden-Harris plan would also increase refugee admission by over 700%. Think of that. Refugee admission. This is agreed to this. We call it The Manifesto between Joe and Crazy Bernie, and AOC plus three too. She’s a great student. She drew the environmental plan. She’s a great student of the environment. How many days do you think she spent at her college studying the environment? Three? They pledged to terminate all national security travel bans. They will open the flood gates to radical Islamic terrorism, and you saw what happened in France just the other day. And we send our sincere best wishes to the President Macron who’s doing a good job, not an easy job. I’m keeping the terrorist jihadist and violent extremist out of our country. Keep them the hell out. I instituted a ban and they all said I was a bad guy, but you know what, I’ll be a bad guy. Does anybody object to the ban on having radical Islam come in? The radical Islamic terrorists, no, we do have a ban. We invested $2.5 trillion in rebuilding our US military. It’s the best and strongest it’s ever been, all made in the USA. With the best equipment in the world, hypersonic rockets go seven times faster than what we have right now. Think of it, we have the greatest military than we’ve ever had. And when I came here first, the world’s most overrated general said to me, sir, we have no ammunition. I said, that’s not good. No president should ever hear that. Well, we now have ammunition like we’ve never had ammunition before. And for our veterans, we have veterans here, we passed VA Choice and VA Accountability. Thank you, fellows. Thank you. VA Choice, VA Accountability, and everyone said that could never happen. We just got a 91% approval rating from the Vets. That’s never happened. It’s never been anyone near there. You ever remember, you were growing up, we were living it, every night they’d have on the news these horror stories about the Vets and how bad they were? You don’t see that anymore. Now, they’ll go out and they’ll find a Vet someplace or somehow, and you’ll see it tonight. There he is, look, Uncle Sam is unhappy. Look at this guy. You look good. Wow. Wow. 105-years-old, wow. Beautiful. Beautiful couple. Beautiful. Thank you very much. Wow. Thank you very much. 105. You look like you’re, to me, about 68. You look beautiful. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Beautiful. That’s great. We killed the leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi. We took out the mass murderer of American troops. Soleimani is dead. I withdrew from the last administration’s Iran nuclear deal. I recognize the true capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. And instead of never ending wars in the Middle East, we have now for the first time, very close to Middle East peace without blood all over the sand. We just signed another day. We just signed another one today, UAE, Bahrain and today Sudan, and we have them lined up. Nobody thought this was going to happen. It turns out that I’m the peace president. Nobody thought that. Remember? They used to say, he’ll be at war. Remember? They said North Korea, you would have been had Hillary won, crooked Hillary, you’d be at war, a nuclear war with North Korea. Whatever happened to that war? Remember? Biden will trap us in nothing but endless Middle East wars and other wars because he has no clue. I did more in 47 months and sleepy Joe Biden did in 47 years. It’s true. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans. It’s a vote for the American dream. It really is. It is. It’s a vote for the American dream. Over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world, and we will end our reliance on China once and for all. That’s already started. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults or law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities where we protect criminals. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to life, and we will keep, remember this. We will hold on to our second amendment, let me put it very simply. Because your second amendment is in serious … Your second amendment without me is in serious trouble. I’ll tell you think about this. When you think about it, I said the other day, it’s I’m standing here. We got the Democrats, we got the fake news, we got the lame stream media. We have the big tech. We have the rhinos. We have the deep state. We have bad Republicans, mostly good. We had a 96% approval rating the other day in the Republican Party and 53% overall. Did you see that 53%? That scares them. They don’t like the 53%. 53% does not lose elections. In history, in history when you’re at 53%, you don’t lose elections. So they’re getting a little bit nervous now. But we’ve had all these different groups and here we stand and we have the White House and they don’t. Think of it, we have the White House and they don’t. And we stopped them from doing very bad things. We will strike down terrorists who threatened our citizens and we will keep America out of these endless, ridiculous, long term, foreign wars. 19 years in Afghanistan. They’re all coming home. You’re welcome. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. We will end surprise medical billing, require the biggest thing that you want me to see, price transparency. Doesn’t sound like much. It’s bigger than health. It’s already done, kicks in on January 1st. Further reduce the cost of prescription drugs [inaudible 01:03:40] and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. Always. Always. America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. And NASA is now the most incredible thing that you’ve ever seen. And let me tell you, when I took over three and a half years ago, it was an abandoned mess. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. We live by the timeless words of our national motto, in God we trust. For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now, you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of Florida. For the last four years, I have been going to the battle for you with everything I have. There has never been a president who has been treated so badly as I have. It’s all turning. All just fine. And by the way, this should never happen to another president. We caught them spying on our campaign. We caught them cheating. We caught them doing all sorts of really bad things. They should really honestly, will happen to them what they did us. They spied, they cheated. It’s treason. Let’s see what happens. Let’s see what happens. But it’s a disgrace and it should never, ever happen to another president. But now I am relying on you to get your friends, to get your family, to get your neighbors, get you to coworkers and get out and vote. So important. From Tampa to Tallahassee, from Jacksonville to Fort Lauderdale, places I all know very much. From Pensacola, where I’m going in a little while to the villages. We stand on the shoulders of red blooded American Patriots, who poured out their heart, sweat, and soul, and you did that. You poured out your heart. You poured out your sweat and your soul to secure our liberty, our liberty, right, and defend our great freedom as a nation. We inherit the legacy of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blazed the trails, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, laid down the railroads, dug out the Panama Canal, raised up the great skyscrapers, won two World Wars, defeated fascism and communism. And from here in this beautiful state landed our brave American astronauts on the face of the moon. We made America into the single greatest nation in the history of the world and the best is yet to come. Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. That’s what we’re doing. With your help, your devotion, your drive, we’re going to keep on working, we’re going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement and there has never been a movement like this. There’s never been crowds like this. There’s never been crowds. And this isn’t even a rally. This is a stop at the villages. This isn’t a rally. I have a rally in a little while in Pensacola, but this isn’t a rally. This is a stop at the villages to say hello to people that have been with me so long.. I’ve been seeing it. I’ve been seeing it. You’re willing to get in fights from your golf carts. You’re willing to do whatever the hell. Where is that person? I love that person. I love our people. But this is just as friendly stop at the villages and look what happens. It’s a beautiful thing. It’s a beautiful thing. But there never has been a movement like this. There’s been movements, but you’ve never had. When Joe Biden’s stops, if he has three, four people. I mean, no, seriously, he has the circles, the little circles, which I love. The guy that does the circle is very good. I’m a perfectionist, nice, big, beautiful yellow. They’re very far apart because he can’t get any people. There’s only five of them and they have a hard time filling them up. And here we have thousands of people no matter where we go. There has never been a movement like this. And it’s a movement of loving our country. It’s a movement of not letting these maniacs take over our country and destroy it. So, I just think it’s such a great honor to finally be with the villages. I wanted to do this so long. I wanted to do it last time. And I told you I did, but they gave me this big ballroom. They hold not enough people and the place was packed outside, but this is really great. And I want to thank my people for putting this together. This was great. We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And we gather with the incredible, unbelievable, beautiful people of the villages in Florida. We have made America powerful again. We have made America wealthy again. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again. We have made America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, villages. We love you, villages. Thank you. Great to be here. Thank you. Thank you. Get out and vote.
