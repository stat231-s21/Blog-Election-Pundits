We present our nation’s highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom to one of the greatest wrestlers in American history, Iowa legend, Dan Gable. He has been an incredible inspiration to so many people. We’re joined today by Dan’s wonderful wife, Kathy, and they’re incredible and large family, including 13 grandchildren. Thank you very much. Thank you Kathy, very much. It’s a great honor for us too. Thank you for being here. We’re also joined by Iowa senators, Chuck Grassley. Where’s Chuck? Chuck, congratulations on everything. Chuck and Joni Ernst, who just had a big victory. Thank you, Joni. What a job, what a job. They had you down a couple of points and you won by a lot. It’s one of those things that you really, you should be very proud of yourself. You campaigned hard, and that was a tremendous victory. Thank you very much. Also, representatives Jim Jordan. Where’s Jim? A great wrestler, a really great wrestler. I won’t go over the record because the only way you’re not great is compared to this guy, perhaps, but he’s a warrior in every way and we appreciate you being here and Markwayne Mullin. Thank you very much for being here and I’m glad your son is doing well and setting records also. These two guys are great. They’re really, really fantastic people. Dan was born and raised in the working class town of Waterloo, Iowa. His mother said she knew Dan would be a wrestler the day they brought him home from the hospital. Even as an infant, Dan refused to let his back even touch the ground. That’s sort of an interesting statement, probably so. At four years old, his parents sent him to the local YMCA where he learned to swim, wrestle, and play football. When he reached high school, Dan decided to commit himself entirely to wrestling. His coach quickly saw his unmatched intensity and gave Dan the keys to the gym so he could come first thing in the morning to practice. At first, Dan was alone, but as he achieved one victory after another, the rest of the team followed his lead. He worked hard, but he was also born with something very special. It’s called talent, and talent, you either have it or you don’t. During his time in high school, Dan’s beloved sister, Diane, toughest time in his life was murdered. Afterwards, Dan poured even more of his energy into wrestling and his exceptional success brought happiness and pride to his family, especially in overcoming this incredible heartbreak that they had with what happened to Diane. As a high school wrestler, Dan went 64 and zero, not losing a single match. I have to say, Jim Jordan told me all about, I knew all about Dan, but he told me things that are pretty amazing, right, Jim? Pretty amazing. Dan then attended Iowa State where he secured two NCAA wrestling championships, National Wrestling Championships, three Big Eight titles and became a three-time All-American. He won 117 consecutive matches and lost only one. Well, in politics I won two, so I’m two and O and that’s pretty good too, but we’ll see how that turns out. After that lone defeat, Dan vowed that it wasn’t going to happen again. He couldn’t stand the feeling of losing a match. He rededicated himself to mastering the sport and soon adapted his wrestling style to reach new heights of greatness. Sports Illustrated labeled Dan the hardest working athlete in the world by far, and detailed his rigorous routine of working out two to three times a day, every single day of the week. They estimated the Dan produced 60 pounds of sweat every seven days. That’s a lot. I’m not sure I want to hear about it, but that’s a lot. That’s a lot of work. In his pursuit of perfection, Dan suffered multiple injuries. His nose, multiple fingers were broken and his feet were very tough stuff. He pushed every single muscle to the absolute limit. Nobody’s ever done it like him, but his unwavering grit and focus, it propelled him forward through all of that adversity, tremendous adversity. Before matches, Dan would repeat the words, “Cakes, carries, ducks, picks, shucks, sweeps,” over and over again. I have to ask Dan, why, why Dan? Oh wow. That’s pretty good. Wow. Well, you did the … Whatever it was. You did the right thing. He had only two things in mind, scoring and dominating. In the midst of the Cold War, he was selected to represent team USA at the 1972 Munich Olympics. The leader of the Soviet wrestling team proclaimed that he would search the USSR and find a wrestler that would defeat Dan Gable. That was his big ambition, and they found somebody that was considered one of the greatest anywhere in the world, but they failed. Dan won every match and did not give up a single point. How many matches in the Olympics, Dan?. You won every match and you didn’t give up a point? That’s a record. That’s a record I think that still stands. To do that, did the Russian in the final did not get a point? What did you win that one by? That’s okay. That’s pretty good. What do you think, Jim? Have you ever heard of when you go six matches and don’t give up a point against great talent? You watched it, right? That’s amazing. To me, that’s amazing. Not giving up a single point. He toppled Soviet preeminence in the sport at that time. Russia’s, they had the greatest wrestlers in the world they thought, except for Dan. They sort of felt they couldn’t beat him. Defeated their wrestler in that final match and took home the Olympic gold medal. As a wrestler, Dan said a pin streak record of 25 consecutive pins. Now, I’m larger than you a little bit. You think I could take you in wrestling? Huh? Would I have a big advantage? What do you think? I agree. Do you agree with that, John? I do. I agree. He’s the expert. That is held to this day, 25 consecutive pins. He was also the first American to win consecutive world at Olympic titles. Dan went on to coach at the University of Iowa where he secured 355 victories and 15 NCAA team titles. Jim Jordan told me that he was the greatest wrestler ever, but he may have been a better coach, right Jim? Now, has any team in any sport ever won 15 NCAA team titles because I don’t know. I mean, I think that’s a lot that’s more than UCLA in basketball, right? I don’t know if it has any … Jim? I don’t think so. I think it’s incredible. His team scored an average of 17 victories for every loss and he was named the University of Iowa’s all-time winning winningest coach. I think probably … You look all over the country. It would be the all-time winningest coach, so that’s incredible, 15 NCAA titles. As a coach, Dan has trained, guided and mentored 152 All-American athletes, 106 Big 10 champions, 45 national champions and 12 Olympians. He was also the head coach of three US Olympic teams. Dan has said, quote, “I never jumped for joy as a player, but I always jumped for joy as a coach.” Other words, he did his job, but he was really rooting for those other people to do theirs. That’s great, Dan. It’s a great statement. Dan has been inducted into the USA Wrestling Hall of Fame, the United States Olympic Hall of Fame, the National Wrestling Hall of Fame, and the United World Wrestling Hall of Fame. In 2013, he helped ensure that wrestling remained a very important top Olympic sport. The National Wrestling Hall of Fame has built a Dan Gable Museum in Dan’s hometown. A permanent reminder of the incredible journey that started in the great state Iowa. I love Iowa. I love Iowa and I knew those polls were wrong. They had me losing Iowa, Dan, and we won Iowa by a lot. There were a lot of polls that were wrong. I love that state. No one has done more to promote wrestling in America than Dan Gable. He’s an athletic giant who conquered one the most difficult in ancient sports in the world. He’s the greatest wrestler probably ever. We’ve never had anybody like him. He’s made our country very proud and he is a true goat. You know what goat is, goat? Greatest of all time, right? He’s the greatest of all time. Today, in recognition of his really exceptional achievements, Dan will become the first wrestler in history to receive this, our most important award, along with the Congressional Medal of Honor. I would now like to ask the military aid to step forward to present Coach Dan Gable with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, but before doing that, I’d like to have Dan say a few words, please. Thank you, Dan, please. You take your time. Thank you. Come on over here and we’ll do it over here. Congratulations, everybody. Here we go. Put that here. Thank you very much. I’m very proud of you, as a nation, and thank you for doing such a great job. We appreciate it. Do you have any questions for Dan? John, for Dan. Yeah, we’re very proud of you, Dan. Thank you very much. Thank you very much everybody, we appreciate it. I heard he is doing well. I just spoke to him. He is doing very well, no temperature. He actually called me early this morning. He was the first call I got. Now, he’s doing very well. That’s another champion, greatest mayor in the history of New York. What he’s doing now is more important. He will admit that. He was the greatest mayor, did a fantastic job, especially when you see what’s going on nowadays, Dan. Rudy Giuliani was a great, great mayor and what he’s doing now, and he will say it is even more important. Well, I think the case already been made. If you look at the polls, it was a rigged election. You look at the different states, the election was totally rigged. It’s a disgrace to our country. It’s like a third world country. These ballots pouring in from everywhere using machinery that nobody knows, ownership nobody knows anything about. They have glitches as they call them. Glitches, with glitches, who aren’t glitches. They got caught sending out thousands of votes all against me, by the way. Now, this was like from a third world nation. I think the case has been made and now we find out what we can do about it, but you’ll see a lot of big things happening over the next couple of days. Very importantly, we’re here for a different reason. We’re here to present our highest achievement, really something that really speaks to such incredible achievement to a man who really is a great man and a great figure in sports, not just wrestling, in sports, one of our greatest athletes of all time. I just want to say it’s an honor to be with you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you everybody. Appreciate it. Thank you very much, Dan.
